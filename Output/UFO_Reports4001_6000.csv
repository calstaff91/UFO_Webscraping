10,"((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  We have no way of knowing whether the report is serious-minded, or whether it might be intended as a hoax.  PD))My son and I were driving home coming down I-83 N on our way home.  As I was driving, I saw something to my left but in front of me move very quickly.  It looked like a fireball that shot up into the sky then plummeted back down into the mountains.  The color though was strange.  It glowed and was almost like blue green, but more green then anything.  I almost wrecked my car and asked my son if he had just seen what I did.  He said yes, and asked what it was.  I really couldn't explain it.A few minutes later, we arrived at home.  We both are getting out of the car, when I hear a faint noise above me.  It's not loud like an airplane or a helicopter, but I could hear something.  I mentioned the sound being weird to my son, and as I said that I noticed he was staring up into the sky asking me what he was looking at.  So I looked and it was this huge, triangle, thing hovering in the sky.  It was moving, but at a pace where it was slow enough to watch.  I stared at it in pure disbelief.  It was triangular in shape, black or like a very dark gray in color, had a circle on the bottom with lines through it of what I could see and a red light on each corner of the triangle.  It was also very low.  If it would have come down a few like 12 feet further, it would have hit the tops of the houses where I live.My son was so scared and was yelling for me to go inside, but all I could do was stand there and watch it move.  It took about 7 minutes to fully disappear back into the sky, but was gone just as fast as it appeared.A few days later the electric in my home started going haywire.  I would come home from work to see all of my clocks blinking.  I had to reset things in my house about 7 times over the last 2 weeks but no one else in our area had any kinds of issues.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

20,"What pulsating bar light on craft, apparently, with no sound...Outside smoking and checking out the sky, like I do every night. Been a while since I've seen anything worth reporting. I live a 20 minute drive from a major airport, so I'm constantly seeing commercial and personal aircraft coming and going all over the place.  This thing was not one of those things.There was no sound.  I only noticed it because I was looking up at the few stars I could see through the lite cloud cover.  First saw it right above me, and it had to have been at commercial aircraft level, so it was quite a ways away.  At first I just thought it was a commercial flight that had just taken off, but the lights weren't anything I'd seen before. Maybe it's something new, I don't know.  But instead of the usual flood-lights in from and small blinking white and read lights, I saw one long bar of white light pulsing at a steady, moderate, constant rate that did not change, accompanied by a pulsating round red light to the left of the white bar.I've never seen a white pulsating bar on any aircraft in my life.  So, I kept watching, wondering what it might be, and as it moved away, I noticed it appeared to sort of wobble left to right as it went, but it's extremely hard to tell when it's so dark out.  That could very well have just been my eyes not having any focal points.  I've seen stars appear to jump and wobble, so I can't say it was wobbling for sure.Other than that, it was on a fairly straight path North to South.  Right from the direction of the airport (North.)  As I watched it, that's when I realized I heard no sound. There's no way I would have missed sound from any commercial or private aircraft.  Just doesn't happen.  Any time I see a plane, I know the sound will hit after the usual delay.  Or I hear the plane and know where to find it by the sound.  This thing... no sound at all... none.  Not normal.  And it was moving at a pretty slow pace compared to major aircraft leaving the airport.  About the speed of a small aircraft.Unfortunately, in the dark, I couldn't tell how high it was, or what its size might be.Another I'll mention because it was very odd, although it may not be related at all... earlier in the day I heard a helicopter outside hanging around for a while... at least 3-5 minutes. I've lived here for a year and half and in this city for nearly a decade now, and I've never seen or heard any helicopter do that.  Every helicopter I've ever seen was headed somewhere and never hung around.

22,"4 lights over Gretna NEAs 2 of my neighbors and myself were out with our children trick-or-treating at about 7:30p.m., I happened to glance up at the sky and notice a light flying towards us.  At first I didn’t think much about it, but as it drew closer I became more interested.It appeared to be at an elevation of about 1,000 ft, a constant blue light and made no sound.  It traveled from the Southwest to the Northeast in a straight line at what I estimate at about 150mph until it disappeared from sight.As we were waiting for our kids to go to the next house, we were talking and wondering if it was or was not a drone discussing elevation, size, speed, and color when we all saw a second object appear, this time green in color.  It followed the exact same flight path and seemed to be at the same elevation and be of the same size of the previous object.Just as the second object disappeared from sight we all turned to see a third blue object appear just where the first 2 had appeared.  It also followed the same flight path as the previous 2 objects.  Again as we lost sight of the third object, a fourth one appeared.This fourth object was also blue and traveled the same flight path at the same speed as the previous 3 but was flying at a higher elevation.After the fourth object left the area and we were teasing each other about getting our tin foil hats out, we watched a large airplane flying from the East to the West gaining altitude and we all noticed the differences between the objects and the plane itself.We aren’t sure what we saw but we know that it was not an airplane and chances are that they aren’t commercially available drones.

Object did not deviate in altitude and flew very level, and crossed from South to North, where it became obscured by trees in my line of sight.  I asked my son who was in a slightly differing position, where it went, he said it continued in a straight line for a about another second, and curved upward at an accelerated rate of speed and disappeared in the cloud cover.

28,"Pulsating bright light trying to use Sirius as camouflage with green and blue orbs darting about at very high altitudeUnidentified Pulsating Object Spotted over Delta County Colorado.  At 0530 on October 31, 2016, I took our dachshund outside for his morning constitutional.  We live on a farm, so I go out with him because of coyotes.  While waiting, a very distant speeding green orb caught my eye the same way a shooting star catches your attention, but you aren’t quick enough to see it.  It was in the South Western sky.  That caused me to notice a VERY bright star that looked unusual.  It seemed to be pulsating red, blue, and green.  It was VERY far away, but I watched it for about ten minutes to see if it was plane.  It stayed in exactly the same spot.I was very curious, so I went in to get the binoculars to study this phenomenon.  I watched it carefully, trying to think of scientific or man-made reasons behind what I was looking at.  Then, through the binoculars and with the naked eye, I could see the green orb near it.  Then, I saw a blue orb move around it.  I ran to get my son who is 17 and quite skilled with a telescope.  I continued observing the pulsating bright light which now seemed to incorporate the blue and green flashing pulses while my son was setting up the telescope.  The light was so bright it was illuminating the moisture in the atmosphere in its vicinity.  It was too bright for the telescope to see without a filter.  By the time we got the telescope figured out, there was too much light pollution from the sun to get a better look using the telescope.  I snapped a few photos, but it is so far away that they look jiggly.  One photo clearly shows a blue orb near the star-like object.I really think I saw a craft that was using a star as camouflage.  It was lined up with Sirius perfectly.  I watched it until 0700 and light out when I had to get ready for work.  It continued to pulsate with the addition of some red flashing.  My son and husband also saw the phenomenon with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  The only natural explanation I can think of was maybe I saw balls of plasma illuminated by Sirius as the blue and green were the same type of color as the Northern Lights.  I really do believe it was a craft though, trying to hide in the light and position of Sirius.  My son is convinced that it was outside of our atmosphere.  I think it was closer because of the clarity I could see the flashing colors through the binoculars.I know this sounds really strange, but please know that my husband and I are both college educated professionals who are also very conservative Christians.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the streaking green object was, but we suspect that the stationary object probably was a ""twinkling"" star, and possibly the star, ""Sirius.""

30,"Orange orb-shaped light arcing across the sky towards horizon at high speedI am a 17-year old male, currently done with high school, and am employed.  I am on two medications, ((deleted)) and ((deleted)), which are used to treat ((deleted)).  These medications have not caused hallucinations during the 2+ years I have been taking them.  This is my first sighting of something like this, although I've read very much about UFOs and seen many photos and videos of strange objects in the sky, but no videos I've seen match exactly what I saw.Very early this morning (Oct. 31 2016) I was sitting at my desk, which faces a window, while watching videos on my laptop.  Sitting at my desk and looking up, the sky takes up about 40% of my window, with my neighbor's house and yard toward the left side of the window taking up the other 60%.At about 12:25 AM (00:25), a sudden moving light in the sky caused me to be distracted from what I was doing and tilt my head to get a better view of the light, adding about 10% more of the sky to my view.The light was an orb/circle shape and was moving very fast, much faster than any plane I've seen in person, including military jets (at high altitudes).  It was bright orange in color. The orb was, from my perspective, about the size of a quarter.  I can't accurately estimate the altitude because the sky was dark at the time of the sighting.The orb flew into my view from the area of the sky to the right of my house and seemed to curve in a flattened, inverted U shape, like a ball being thrown, while moving away towards the horizon.The light disappeared after about 1 second of flight from where I saw it; it could have been in flight longer but I can't be sure because I only saw it once it came into my view of the sky.  After 3 hours, I have seen no other lights.",Duration:~1-2 seconds,"Location: Columbia, SC",Occurred : 10/31/2016 00:25  (Entered as : 10/31/2016 00:25),Posted: 11/4/2016,Reported: 10/31/2016 1:12:15 AM 01:12,Shape: Light

32,"pairs of lights. one pair vibrated and chased each other.  Large structure outlined by star lights moved towards me.I went outside at 10:30 pm with my observing chair and 7x50s.  It was cloudy in every direction.  I swept around the sky three times.  I saw two white lights south of my position through my 7x50s. These white lights were just sitting there.  Suddenly, these lights began vibrating towards each other.  They would move far apart and then come together. All very quickly.  Back and forth.  Back and forth. Very fast.  I said to myself what the hell is this? This can't be.  These lights were moving very fast.I put down my 7x50s.  I looked up and down the street.  All was normal.  I looked directly at these vibrating lights. This cannot be.  These lights were vibrating very fast.  Then bang all stopped.  These lights sat still next to each other.  Then bang all of a sudden the left light started chasing the right light.  This chase moved in closed elliptical orbits.  These lights were moving so fast the light pattern that was created looked like a ball of string.  This cannot be I said to myself.  Finally both lights came to a stop.  They sat right next to each other. Now the sky started to clear.  This pair of lights started moving together towards my position slowly.  They came to a stop just short of my position.  The sky was now clear. I said this cannot be. The right side of the sky was filled with pairs of white light. There were about 14 pairs of lights. I said this cannot be. I looked up and down my street to see if I was seeing things. All appeared normal. Then on my left side and way! to the south I saw movement and then looked with my 7x50s. I saw what looked like a big structure moving towards me. It looked like a B-2 bomber but outlined with bright stars. There was a bright star at every apex except the nose. Instead there were two bright stars on either side of the nose. This structure moved with its left wing all the way down and its right wing all the way up. I saw right through this structure and thought I could see the background sky. This structure stopped abreast of the pair of lights on my right. This thing was big. It seemed like it was three times the size of a B-2 bomber. At this point I said to myself what the hell is going on? I then saw a light moving frm my right to my left. It was far off. I used my 7x50s. It was a small triangular craft. The craft was about 10 feet on its side and was self illuminated.  Each apex was gently rounded.  The craft appeared light brown to slightly yellow.  There was a white lens or glass circle in the center of the craft.  You could see this white window but it seemed to be lit from the outside.  This craft made no noise and there were no marker lights. I do not  know what lit up this craft.  I watched this craft for several minutes.  It disappeared off to my left.  I returned to look at the light show.  The sky was now completely normal.  I have no idea what I saw especially the vibrating lights and one light chasing the other light.  Many times over I said to myself I am not going to report this sighting.  Then I saw the picture of the lights posted on the NUFORC site dated March 12, 2017, from Tacoma, Washington.

40,"Boomerang shaped craft, adorned with, or emitting, white lights.At approximately 20:00 on October 30, 2016, I was taking my dogs out in my yard for a bathroom break.  It was a crisp, clear, starry night and as I am a nightly sky watcher, I turned my eyes upwards.I play little games with myself while I sky gaze such as finding and greeting constellations, planets and stars that I know and finding clusters of stars which may appear very faint (I live inside the city so there is light pollution) with my naked eye.  It was this exact thing that drew my attention to what I saw next.As I was scanning the skies and engaging in my usual entertainment, I noticed above me a very faint, small cluster of what I thought at first were stars, but as I continued to look at them, I was confused to see them moving slowly in a straight line approximately North to South above me. My thought in that moment was, ""Why are those stars moving?"" and I actually did a kind of double-take because I thought my eyes were mistaking the movement.  They were not.  The object appeared like a very far away, faint, moving cluster of tiny white stars (no idea how many but a fair amount) and the only reason I could discern it's shape was not from any outline against the sky, but from the shape of this ""star cluster"" itself.It moved slowly (a little slower than an average plane) and was soundless.  I cannot even begin to estimate either its distance or size but I had the very real impression it was both VERY LARGE and VERY FAR AWAY.  The size dwarfed that of any planes that I see over my yard.  There was also no discernable sound I could associate with it and it appeared silent to my ears.I watched it move Southward until my line of sight became obscured by the trees at my back fence, but I was able to keep my eyes on it for what seemed like quite awhile (mere seconds, but I was pretty focused on it and it seemed much longer).  My dogs noticed nothing.Then I ran into the house super excited to tell my husband what I had seen and make a social media post about my excitement!

64,"A fireball to the eye but through binoculars it was a saucer with lights around the bottom.My son noticed an orange ball in the southern sky and watched it until it faded away in the northern sky on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2016, in Burnet, Texas.  He told me about it and when I looked up, I saw the orange ball of light in the east moving north and then fading away.  My son got the binoculars and my phone to record it if it came back again, it did...  We watched this thing do this 4 times.  As he watched it through the binoculars he described it to me as being a saucer with lights rotating, I didn't see that with my eye and the video is not very good as it doesn't depict anything but a fireball, but I did look through the binoculars and can verify what he saw.  The video I am sending is the third lap this thing took that we watched from start to finish.  Please disregard the audio and I apologize for the poor, poor quality of the video.I was on the phone  describing it to my cousin, who was a few blocks north and saw it as well, when it took the fourth lap, and this time it's trajectory was slightly different as it came right over my head. I got off the phone but wasn't able to capture what I saw with my naked eye, which was a saucer with lights and it had a bluish purple aura to it. It went right over my head in the middle of the street!  I mean not right above, but way lower than any helicopter or plane would ever be.  After it flew overhead, it again faded into the darkness, but not because it flew out of sight.It did not reappear that night that we know of, as we went inside.  It was very interesting to finally see something I have always known to be out there.  It is crazy how it would disappear in the North only to reappear in the South and it didn't look like it was further than the edges of our small town when it did this.

I went outside still on the call with the individual I was speaking with.  I came out the garage looking west across the street, and witnessed the lights in the sky that were over South Mountain from our driveway I could look West and over the garage and the neighbor's house you can see the orbs that were flashing in the sky they would get brighter and then diminish in brightness.  I got off of phone.  I opened my video camera on my phone and started getting what I could of what I was seeino.  It was pretty amazing.  I've never seen anything like that ever!  5 orbs all hovering in the sky.  Together not moving.  In a second at 2216 the orb on south side of group vanished.  At that point there was now 4 of them together in the sky 3 looking like a stoplight figuration stacked and then one look as it was moving towards the Southwest because it got smaller and higher and then you can still see there was three that still look like they were stacked on top of each other and the way that they were stacked it didn't look like they could be aircraft at least not commercial planes anyhow. Tthen two proceeded rather quickly to continue out into the North Area of the sky ratherrather.  They just went out of eye sight. the other one just kind of hovered in the air and then went up and disappeared. that I got  on video.  for a while you could see it flashing different colors before it was gone.  Then, I looked to the north again.  Out of nowhere there were 2 very bright light that flashed and they look like they were hovering in one spot their brightness was very noticeable.  Much like dimmer switch. they were in one spot then would separate. and then they proceeded to get even brighter and I was able to get that on my camera then I came back to look in the same spot over across the street in the sky.  And it was back!  Bright and it looked like it was getting closer and bigger and brighter and then it started to get smaller as it look like it was climbing in elevation on a 60* angle, across the sky coming towards the east.  It moved across the sky above our north  corner of the house out here in Apache Junction I watched it come all the way from the other side of the valley over South Mountain toward my home, and its lights just disappeared.  The lights cut smaller as it got closer and went up.  There was no sound no nothing. It was gone like it went right up.  Nothing like an aircraft when it goes by over head, you hear jets.  I was coming back in and then all the sudden I heard this loud deep rumbling and you couldn't see lights or anything just a odd void.  I have it on video.  Then I started looking up airport flights etc to rule out planes.  I could not believe I witnessed this.  I began to fill out report sitting on my truck when my neighbors friend walked over asking what that noise was.  He was waiting smoking a cigarette, and asked if I seen the weird lights. and then I heard that odd deep rumbling again.  The guy was looking around to see where it was coming from.  He could not see anything nor could I.  That was at 2249..I was working on report so I looked at time on phone.  I and this other guy witnessed a black void go across the sky fast towards the east like the other one.  Only a little further north. It looked to be above the houses next to field.  The guy grabbed my arm when he seen it first, (as I was looking up), pointing at it.  About 6 seconds later we heard another rumble.  I decided I had enough so did he.

At the time my drone captured this object on video, it was about 1/2 mile from me. The air speed of my drone was about 26 mph. The altitude of the drone was 187 feet. My drone was recording video in 4K resolution at 30 fps.I did not see, nor hear this object at the time I was flying my drone. Upon video review I noticed this object on video on my UHD TV. I replayed the video several times trying to figure out what I was seeing. I then ran the video through my editing software to shorten it to just the time frame the object appeared and slowed the frame rate by 10 times. The object flew beneath my drone.I sent MUFON a report that same day along with the URL address to my Youtube channel containing the video. I received a call from Sandy Davis, an investigator with MUFON within 30 minutes.  He was totally amazed by what my drones camera caught.  The MUFON experts were unable to determine what I caught on video, but were extremely intrigued and consider it to be a mystery.Here is the URL containing the video:   https://youtu.be/6BUA6zdbgEE((NUFORC Note:  The video, taken from a flying platform, is very high quality, and certainly has captured something interesting.

Each was very large....about the size of a football field if they were rounded out.

Other times one would jet sharply in another direction, moving in a manner I have never seen any light or airplane moving. It was the oddest thing I have ever seen!  And they stayed there, in that same area, for quite a while - at least 5-10 minutes.  Could have been longer, but I finally got too far away to see them.  The oddest thing about them was the kind of indescribable movement these objects were doing.

Looking through my binoculars (10 x's)the craft I saw was about the same size as a jet airliner. The UFO gave no emission or contrail. It had to be in at least a low orbit around our planet. That far away, looking through my binoculars it appeared to be the same size as a jet airliner.  The object had to be gigantic for it to appear the size as a jet airliner.

When it went over the pine tree in our yard, I said something like ""what is that?"", and my wife and daughter began to look for it.  My wife suggested it might be a meteoroid as there was a shower expected, but then she saw it as well and knew it wasn't a meteoroid.  Shortly thereafter, my daughter saw it as well, and they both saw it long enough to identify it in a way similar to what I was seeing.The best way I've come up with to describe it is like this:  Imagine the night sky reflected in a still, dark pond.  Now imagine dropping a single pebble into this pond and how the waves created alter the reflection of the sky.  The UFO looked like a single one of these waves, but cut into an arc of about 1/4 of a circle, slightly pointed at the center of the leading edge.  As it moved across the sky, it obscured the stars causing a small amount of refraction, with only the leading edge clearly visible.  I'm not sure if the leading edges visibility was due to it emitting or reflecting light, or if it was just a more intense distortion of the night sky.The objects speed and direction was constant, and it moved silently.It's hard to judge the altitude and therefore the size of the object, but it was at least 200 feet above the ground because it was above the trees.  If it was only that high up, then it was approximately 16 feet across from wingtip to wingtip.  The total time the object was visible to me was about 8-10 seconds, in which time it traveled from behind my neighbors trees to behind our house as it moved west to east.  This is a distance of about 50 yards. Jamie and Libby picked up the object as it was about half-way through this path.At first I thought it was an optical illusion, a problem with my vision or perhaps due to me standing up too fast.  I also considered that it could be related to smoke or heat from the campfire.  However my family's observations, and in particular their descriptions matching what I saw (before I described it myself) ruled-out a problem with my vision as the explanation.  The other explanations (smoke, heat) didn't make sense as we continued to see the object long after it was beyond the range of these local effects.Other possibilities we considered were animals.  The general shape was not unlike the V formation birds fly in, but you don't usually see flocks of birds flying at night, and the shape was too smooth to be made up of group of birds.  Also, the effect it had on the starlight isn't something that would be created by flying animals that I'm familiar with.I'm familiar with most civil and military aircraft, and the shape, speed and translucency of the object was unfamiliar to me.  The fact that it was silent would indicate that it was either unpowered, or so far away as to be unheard (which would indicate that the object was of gigantic proportions).  Experimental aircraft may be an explanation as we frequently spot military aircraft flying nearby, and we also live less than an hour from the Oshkosh airport, home of the Experimental Aircraft Association.At this point a clear identification or explanation isn't available.  The most rational explanation I can come up with is that it was some kind of cloaked/stealth glider, using one of the recently described optical cloaking mechanisms.  This would explain the shape, motion and visible signature of the object as well as its silent flight.  That said I've never heard of such a vehicle, and if it were a glider it would have had to have been dropped from an aircraft as there are no natural high elevation points nearby.  It would have also presumably landed within a few square miles, and so far I haven't heard any other reports of the object being sighted in the city of Beaver Dam.There may be other environmental explanations as well.  Being a clear, cold night I'm not aware of any such explanation but I'm hoping that by sharing this story others with more knowledge of the subject can contribute additional possible explanations.",Duration:10 seconds,"Location: Beaver Dam, WI",Occurred : 10/22/2016 19:40  (Entered as : 10/22/16 19:40),Posted: 10/27/2016,Reported: 10/26/2016 11:44:51 AM 11:44,Shape: Other

152,"Two diamond shaped craft rotating around each other with bright lights noted in broad daylight for 15 min.While flying quad-copters for the day at a school on Saturday afternoon, I turned to the north and noticed 2 lights in the sky that were distinct from the high clouds.  At first, I believed these to parachutes or para-motor type craft, but was confused, given the fact that the winds were beginning to make our flights difficult on the ground, and when I called attention to it to my friend who was flying quads with me, she too saw the same two craft and we immediately began to try to match it to known aircraft or explanations.The two craft were seen at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and were due north of my position.  The craft were moving in relation to one another with the top left craft from my position being brighter while the second similarly shaped craft was less distinct and even somewhat translucent.  After a time the second craft was no longer seen and the brighter and larger craft stayed in view for many minutes.  I attempted to film the craft with my on-board quad-copter camera but the lens for both this and my camcorder I had were not at all appropriate to this kind of a sighting and thus nothing was captured.  In fact, the quad-copter camera mysteriously did not even have a record of the flight even though I had made certain to activate the camera and there was plenty of space left on the SD card!  Early on in the sighting, the two craft were moving quite erratically and in revolutions clockwise around the other as if they were orbiting one another.  My first thought was of a parachutist or para-motor craft in trouble with a bad chute then I realized how high these objects were and that it couldn't possibly be one or more chutes.  We couldn't identify any noise coming from these craft.  The lights were constant in brightness at first and there was no variation until the smaller craft began to fade from view.As we watched, the motion of the bright light transitioned to a smooth rotating motion clockwise and slightly descending to the lower right towards the other object which seemed to rotate with it.  The other object maintained it's distance from the larger during this change of altitude.  When the brighter object suddenly stopped its rotation, the shape for both was seen as a diamond shape for both craft by both of us.  The distinct edges and structure were then apparent and it was obviously a pair of physical objects.The objects were behind the high thin clouds at times (still easily seen through the clouds) and my estimation of their height would be in the thousands of feet in the air. Other conventional aircraft in the air before, during and after the sighting were seen and this was definitely lower than commercial jet traffic but higher than the thin clouds. Given the distance and elevation, these had to be of considerable size. A commercial jet I saw during the sighting at 30,000 feet or so to the west had about the same apparent diameter as the larger bright diamond shape, so the object we were watching would be estimated to have a size approaching 50 to 100 feet as a very unscientific guess. The other object which ""dissolved"" from view was of a smaller size and perhaps was 75% of the size of the larger brighter diamond shape. I also considered that the sighting might be a jet coming towards me with navigation lights on, but this was ruled out when the slow orbiting motion was observed. No jet or prop aircraft would do this since this would mean a aileron roll to the pilot's left or 45 to 60 degrees (to match what I was seeing) which would then have produced strong movement to the right from my point of view (unless the pilot was doing aerobatics which definitely was not the case here). Additionally, both objects had a long period of hovering in one position coupled with a slow movement to the east by 10 or so degrees over a period of minutes mystified me and made me rule out normal aircraft. I also considered if this was a balloon, blimp, glider or a helicopter. The observation of the two objects satisfied none of these explanations as we both attempted to ascertain what we were seeing. I also considered astronomical causes. No meteor trail was noted. It was not a planet, since the ecliptic was to my back since I was facing due north during daylight hours. It was not a supernova, comet or any other natural sky-borne phenomena that I have ever encountered.Around 14:05 hours Pacific, I pointed a camcorder towards the object and was marking my position in relation to it.  The sole remaining diamond shape object was clearly visible with only a few whispy clouds near it and I turned the camera away and then back to the position of the object only to find is was nowhere to be seen.  In a matter of seconds, it had vanished.One notable event occurred some minutes afterwards.  A lower altitude Cessna or similar style aircraft that appeared to be completely painted black appeared from the north and at a much lower altitude.  If overflew us directly at an altitude of around 1500 feet and was flying extremely slowly.  I cannot say if this was related, but it certainly caught my interest given the direction of travel and behavior.I have spent a lifetime in around rocket and aircraft systems and have spent 30+ years in amateur astronomy.  I have flown in fighter aircraft as a civilian and know the full range of U.S. and foreign civilian and military aircraft from past and current fleets.  This matched none of the craft or natural astronomical phenomena I have ever seen or have knowledge of.  I cannot say what we saw, but it was certainly an unknown and my hope is that someone else in the area saw it and can add their testimony to the sighting and perhaps identify what it was.",Duration:15 minutes,"Location: Shingle Springs, CA",Occurred : 10/22/2016 13:50  (Entered as : 10/22/16 13:50),Posted: 10/27/2016,Reported: 10/22/2016 6:03:38 PM 18:03,Shape: Diamond

157,"Intensely white round object moving about 30' above tree tops in residential areaOn October 22, 2016, at 0:55, my 21 year old son and I were driving home.

It stood out in the total darkness.  Because we had just come out of an Orionid meteor shower, my first thought was this was part of that.  However, my family stargazes at night and have never seen anything without some sort of downward curve.  I also recalled my encounter during daylight two months earlier; both objects were alike.  It was moving straight north no more than about 30’ above the tree tops and traveling up to about twice our speed.  It was not descending or moving in a downward angle.

I was pulling out of the parking lot when I first saw the disc-like shape, it did not appear to be traveling at a high speed but as I drove forward, it began to move in the direction of where the sun was.

They said they didn't see anything at first, so I yelled, ""Block the sun!""

189,"large, bright, high altitude white sphere moving very slowly from north to south-east---- then dropsabout 7:30-7:40 pm- just dark  about 15 min.had just unloaded some brush from the back of my truck and finished just as it became too dark to see what I was doing.  Drove the truck back up to the other end of property.  After I got out I noticed a bright light.  Didn't think anything of it at first as I am only about 3 miles north of the international airport.  I stood and watched a moment.  I immediately noticed that it was barely moving---  way slower than a jetliner would be going......  it also appeared very bright and large as well.   I had binoculars just inside the door of my shop.  I grabbed them and watched the object.  (7x50)    It showed to be perfectly spherical and a bright white light evenly distributed over the surface.  The light was a pure white-- not the red-orange that is reflected off satellites just after dark.  It seemed to be moving very slowly across the sky.  Jupiter (or Saturn) was just setting in the western sky--- and the object was was about 1 to 2 times the diameter of the planet.   The objects speed seemed to vary from very slow to all most stopped.Judging by the very slow speed --- a satellite at that slow speed would have to be several thousand miles out to go that slowly----  and to have THAT angular diameter at that distance---  it would have had to be many miles across.However I don't believe it was a satellite- as it was the wrong color and the brightness did not decrease as it went off zenith towards the far horizon as a satellite would have. I watched it from just north of zenith at about a  020 compass heading------ and  ended at about 150 degrees near the tops of the far pine trees.I estimate I watched it through about 60 degree arc ------ and  for about 2 to 2.5 minutes through that arc.   I watched it move very slowly along the above path.  as it approached the top of the trees to the south-east----  it slowed to nearly a stop---- and then it changed direction to going straight down and behind the trees.  I did not see much decrease in brightness except that would be consistent with the object getting farther away gradually.  It did not ""wink-out"" like satellites do ( which they do long before they get near the tree line)  I am a physicist by degree and have piloted airpcraft.  The object had NO navigation lights of any kind and no tail beacon.  The light did not have the look of a bulb ( a tiny point) either a nav light or a landing light. I compared its color to several passing airliners which were about 10-20 miles away. The aircraft's white lights were more orange than the object.   It was a bright white sphere with the illumination evenly distributed across the whole surface.there seemed no way to estimate how high it could have been.

I watched the lights for some time expecting to see some sort of circular or semicircular formation that would suggest net but the pattern was all over the place.I drove into Santa Monica and looked from the bluffs there but they couldn’t be seen. Driving along the coast, they were also out of site.  When I stopped, again at the first place I had noticed them it was still going on.It sounds more like a test of some sort, point Magu military base is not far off but I am unable to find any indication they were there.

193,"Starting on Tuesday, October 18th, around 6:30pm, in North Carolina, I noticed that just above the sunset was what I thought was a star.. albeit really bright star, but seemingly just a star.  Not to be confused with the Nibiru idea.  This does not resemble a second sun, but it looks like a star that just happens to be about 2-3 times larger than even the brightest star visible from here..not as large as the sun, or moon.  It stood out because I stare at the sky everyday into the evening and night and have never noticed it.  Apon watching it, I realized it was moving extraordinarily slow with the help of the trees as a reference.  It was not moving like a plane, or at plane speed, nor did it resemble a plane..or even a satellite.  I watched it for about 25 minutes and then it was just gone..not out of the line of sight, or over the horizon, but simply gone.  The next day it was there again.  And today it was there again.  At first I believed it was simply a star, but then upon research found that several people over the past week, or so have noticed it worldwide.  So far the only reports from the US have been from southern states.  Most reports from Australia and other countries.  There have been photos.  It appears to be more of a circular ripple rather than a 3 dimensional object.  There have also been infrared images of the sun with this thing showing up in them.  I do not believe it is Nibiru.  I'll try to find more on it, but as of now it still seems fairly new.",Duration:3 days,"Location: Charlotte, NC",Occurred : 10/20/2016 18:30  (Entered as : 10/20/16 18:30),Posted: 10/21/2016,Reported: 10/20/2016 8:23:08 PM 20:23,Shape: Light
194,"Spherical Object Sighted above the clouds at Johns Creek, GAOn Friday afternoon at 4pm, I noticed a bright white spherical object above normal approach aircraft traffic to Atlanta.  I estimate the object was above 20 thousand feet.  The day was sunny with very few clouds.The object was headed south in the direction of Atlanta City above the clouds.  At times the object reflected sunlight as it was a sunny afternoon.  I observed the object for about 7 to 10 minutes.  The object was moving at a steady rate of speed in the direction of Atlanta.  It did not move in an erratic way.There were no visible lights on the object.  It appeared to be the exact same color as the white clouds.  Eventually the object disappeared as I could no longer see it due to it's height and distance from me.The object was not easy to see.  I happened to notice it as I was watching an aircraft overfly my location.  The aircraft that overflew my location was a fly-over not on approach to Atlanta.The spherical shape just happened to catch my eye as it was bright white and well above the fly-over aircraft.  While the object appeared spherical in shape the bottom of the object appeared to be of a saucer shape and had a somewhat grey color.  The object was significantly higher than the flyover at my location but was not moving at the same rate of speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

200,"Red and white blinking lights moving like satellites north to south nearly 20 different times.Date 10/20/16   My name is ((name deleted)),  I am 23 years old, I was formally a server trainee at ((restaurant name deleted)) until recently.  I live in Gainesville, Florida, where these sightings take place.  Earlier this evening, at around 10:00 pm 10/19/16, I went outside to enjoy a cigarette and lurk at the stars.  The sky was clear.  Within 5 minutes of being outside I had seen what appeared to me as a satellite.  It was blinking blue and white light and coming from the north heading south.  It was completely silent and too far to be an airplane, also it was moving quite fast.  It went from the north horizon to the south in a matter of about 2 minutes.  I thought nothing of this, I was certain it was a satellite.  I continued to watch the sky, just moments after the first object had disappeared into the distance, I became aware of another blinking light coming from the north heading south.  This light was blinking red and white. It behaved similar to the first object I had seen.  No sound, very distant, yet fast.  Every blinking light I saw after this was red and white.Things became stranger, as I layer out in my front lawn I kept seeing the same blinking object move from North to south like clock work.  As soon as the light had become to distant to see I would without doubt expect to see it reappear in the north again, and it would. I saw what appeared to be the same object fly across the entire sky and reappear close to 20 times.  Each time only taking about 2 minutes to go from one horizon to the other. Then a few minutes later would appear again.At this point I was at disbelief.  My niece who is 21 saw the object I was looking at and reassured me it was a satellite.  I am convinced this is not the case. She was very uninterested. At a certain time during my observation I noticed not 1 but 2 blinking red and white lights within my sight.  There were multiple objects all the same but there is without doubt no way these were in orbit.  There is no way this was of human design.  They would always start north and head south and as I observed it became hard to tell if they where traveling in a straight line or hovering freely.  At one point I took my eyes off the object only to find that when I had looked back it actually had moved further back north in a matter of seconds.  It had jumped from one area of the sky to the other.  I know because it was going behind a tree then suddenly it was visible right above me again.I continued to observe for a couple hours.  Every time I walked outside I could find the blinking light coming from the north.  However they stopped reappearing and it was surprising to me.  I had seen the object nearly 20 times. It seemed around 1:30am the operating time for these machines came to an end.It was hard to see anything besides just the blinking red and white light.  It seemed as if at times the light would become dimmer or more vivid as it moved.  Although I did capture some video evidence I was more focused on observing it with my own eyes.  I managed to obtain 4 short videos of 4 different appearances of this object. In other words I would start recording every time I saw the light coming from the north on 4 separate occasions.  All together I saw this event unfold before me a total of about 20 times.After one too many cigarettes and mosquito bites I decided to write my report and end my observations. personally it seems there were far to many satellites to be satellites at all.  And they reappeared to often to be in orbit.https://youtu.be/gXxK6Rpr7AU Here is a youtube link of one of the 4 videos.

Thought it might be a helicopter, but the sound was similar to a turbo prop, but deeper in tone, but without the sound of the props.  It continued moving east,maybe fifteen miles and begin hovering.  As it hovered,I begin observing the lights hoping to identify the craft.  There were red lights,one at the top,one at the bottom,and one in the middle.  The top light blinked once every to seconds.the bottom light randomly blinked three times every two seconds.  There was continuos white lights through the middle and randomly blinking lights at the bottom, sometimes blinking in sequence.  It appeared to be three lights along the bottom.

When it passed, still heading so! uth, it only made it to a Willow line maybe 1000 ft from my house, at that time I realized I couldn't hear it anymore, freaked out and darted under a porch overhang I have and as I did it literally flew out of view as fast as lighting just to the east of the milky way.

A couple of weeks earlier, whilst watching the pictures that I took on my phone during my holiday, I noticed an odd shaped blue object sitting next to the One World Trade Center tower.

Then I remembered that my girlfriend was also taking photos with her phone of the same tower at the same time. I took her phone and looked closely at her pictures and unsurprisingly, the same object is on 2 other photos taken with her phone.

217,"Very bright, spherical flying object spotted and photographed at UMass Dartmouth, passing over the woods behind the wind turbine.I am a photography enthusiast and often photograph landscapes, airplanes, and night scenes.  On this night I went to the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth to capture the library.  I was standing on the hill of the amphitheater when I turned to photograph cars passing on Ring Road in front of the wind turbine.  I saw a very strong, twinkling spherical light over the woods behind the turbine.  I initially dismissed the object for a star, but quickly realized that it was too bright and moving too quickly at much too low an altitude to be a star.  Having photographed Chinese lanterns before, I knew that this object could NOT be one, because it lacked the proper light diffusion pattern within the object.  The light was also too bright, almost white, and looked solid.  There was also a small airplane flying in the vicinity, at a much higher altitude.  I walked all the way to the turbine, while attempting to get better photos of the object.  I took as short exposures as! possible while also using a tripod. I set the camera on a timed shutter release to prevent motion blur.  It made no noise, and had a flight pattern that was almost completely against the wind at the time (very strong winds on the ground that night,  I had to hold my tripod). I took several photos and am very unsettled by the lack of an explanation.  Zooming in only furthers the mystery and I would like assistance in finding out what this object was.

238,"Bright, flickering, flamelike light out over Lake Michigan.  Stationary, not a plane.  Not a lantern, there were extreme winds.Around 1945 last night, I witnessed a stationary, but extremely bright and flickering light in the sky, almost like a stationary fireball.  I was looking eastward from my balcony, and the light appeared to be maybe a couple of miles or so off the shore of Lake Michigan out over the water. I initially assumed this was a plane, but it was definitely stationary so I ruled that out.  Then I figured it must be Mars or Jupiter because the object had a reddish hue to it and was relatively low on the horizon, but after checking a star gazing app, I confirmed both Mars and Jupiter were in opposite skies from the object.  Next, I assumed a Chinese lantern, but this didn't seem likely from the start. The object was extremely bright and looked like a flickering flame. There were very strong wind gusts on the night of 10/17, so this object remaining stationary for an extended period rules out the lantern because it certainly would not have sat still given the strong winds.I went about my way and checked maybe 30 minutes later and the object was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

247,"Observed a white, silvery sphere that held stationary, then moved east into the morning skyI observed a silvery white object that appeared high in the blue, but partly cloudy morning sky.  Its position remained fixed, by the rail of my balcony, for several minutes until it began to move steadily east southeast at constant velocity.  The clouds were a mix of TCU, from ~ 5000-10000' at low level and high SCT Cirrus ~ 25000' (my estimates).  The TCUs moved east to west in front of the object, which did not appear to reflect the morning sun, but softly, glowed organically.  Through the binoculars it appeared textured and matted, and too far/ small to appear on the camera.  If this object were at 10000' I would estimate the diameter to be about 5'.  After watching it pass behind a few TCUs, it finally failed to emerge.I considered this may have been a balloon at a level between the lower westerly flow and the higher easterly flow, moving easterly as it rose.

My oldest son (14) and I stepped out onto the balcony to look for the helicopter – it sounded like it was practically on top of us, but too low and close to see it over the tree line.  It was dark, the full moon was still on the opposite horizon behind our building.My first thought was that it might be the police tracking someone on the ground in the woods, except this helicopter was SO loud – sounded more like a Black Hawk than the standard choppers that police/news uses.  And we couldn’t see searchlights of any kind over the woods.Suddenly we saw a reddish/orange light break over the tree line headed South.  Our balcony faces West and this light was running straight & perpendicular across our view.  It was a large orb shape, flying very fast in a perfectly straight line – skimming above the trees no more than a few hundred feet off the ground, and a few hundred yards from us.  We had a clear view of it for just a couple of seconds before it was lost behind the trees again.  It didn’t weave or change course, didn’t wobble, or change colors/size/shape.  There were no other lights on it, and it didn’t appear to pulse.Following just behind it was a large military helicopter which appeared to be pursuing the object.  The helicopter was large and dark colored, either black or gray with only a couple of small red lights on it and no visible markings that I could see.The orb appeared to accelerate slightly while it was in view but then backed off a bit, as if it was trying to stay just out of reach of the helicopter.  We had a clear view of both the object and the chopper together in the sky for a moment, and the orb appeared to be about 1/3 to ½ as large as the helicopter.The whole incident lasted no more than about 30-45 seconds from first hearing the helicopter to when the object and helicopter disappeared over the trees headed South.

The sun was to my back and almost directly overhead, when the objects were almost overhead, it became more difficult to see them, only a small part of the leading edge was illuminated by the sun, the underside disappeared as it blended in with the hazy blue sky, finally disappearing as they passed close to the sun.It is my opinion the objects were solid and being illuminated by the sun on their upper surface.No noise that could be attributed to the objects was heard.

282,"Several pulsating lights maneuvering and acting in ways unknown to this earth and the single strangest thing I've seen in my life.On the night of Friday, October 14, 2016 , I observed the strangest thing that I have ever seen in my life.  It was approximately 7:45 pm when I got into my car and started driving over to my girlfriend’s apartment.  There was not a cloud in the sky and the Moon was completely full, actually appearing more full than I have ever seen it.  No less than five minutes into driving I noticed some strange lights in the sky that immediately caught my eye.  Straight ahead in the sky above were several strange lights scattered everywhere.  Four lights in particular intrigued me so much that I could not stop swerving in and out of my lane, due to the fact that I couldn’t take my eyes off the sky.  Four lights arranged themselves very close to each other and seemed to be pulsating, fading in and out. It  appears to be a disc shaped flying saucer.  As I continue to watch it I noticed several more lights in the sky.  There were lights glowing to the left and to the right of the d! isc, and a pretty good distance away from it.  These lights moved in ways that are impossible for any aircraft we know today.  One light shot straight up at an incredible rate of speed.  The other light zigzagged and changed directions instantly.  More lights then appear on the left side of the sky darting off at high rates of speed.  At this point there are so many different glowing lights in the sky I don’t know which ones to look at.  All the while the four lights in the center of the sky continued to pulsate and stay in the same position, never moving from their original location.  At this point I take out my phone and record a video of the sky.  The video is seven seconds long, this is only because while I was recording I looked at the screen and it didn’t appear that the lights were showing up on the video.  I then became extremely disappointed and stopped recording the video.  It took 15 minutes to get to my girlfriends apartment and I could see these lights the entire time th! at I was driving.  After that I went into her apartment and did! n’t look at the sky anymore that night.  I tried telling my girlfriend about it and she didn’t really understand what I had just saw and didn't show too much interest. I didn’t even try to show her the video because I was sure it didn’t record anything.  After that we watched a movie and went to bed.  The next day I was scrolling through my photos and decided to watch the video, I was stunned. I will share the video my phone recorded with everyone, take a look yourself.  Also, the video is  even more amazing if you turn the brightness up and play it in slow motion.  I also saved a version of the video in slow-motion with the brightness turned up.  I will also share that one. I’m not sure what these lights were and I’m not even assuming they were extraterrestrial.  All I know is they were not human made lights and they were anything but ordinary and completely not  normal. In addition,  I have never been a person who exaggerates, lies, or seeks attention.  Everybody who knows me would tell you that. I am 29 years old, I have a college degree from a very good university and I have no history of any medical or psychological problems.  Anybody driving on the road at night would have seen these lights, yet nothing was mentioned on the news, and nobody I've come across saw them.  I've shown a few people in my family the video, and they are puzzled too.  Unlike me, they didn’t see what I did so they pretty much forget about it.  On the other hand I can't forget about it or stop thinking about it.  I will share the video.  Watch it closely and don’t just watch it once.  Trust me you will start to notice more and more strangeness when you watch it again and again.

At about 4am I went outside to continue observing--mostly to try to figure out if it was a high-flying small copter drone, which was the only thing I could think of which could have similar jerky movements in all directions.  The Little Dipper was just to the right of where the object was moving around in the sky.I occasionally saw little ""poof"" flashes of red light nearby to but not part of the object, like it had let out a silent firecracker. At approximately 5am I went back inside to mention the event to a friend, and to get a pair of binoculars to try to make out a shape of the object.  Unfortunately all I could make out of the object through the binoculars was a bright white light with a blue hue -- not any detail as to its shape.  The friend came outside and observed the object from ~5:30am-5:45am, going back inside after feeling chilled.  I remained outside observing until 6:30am.  From 6am-6:30am the movements of the jobject seemed more subtle than earlier and was slightly less bright, so I assume it was moving away from my observing location.

Looking over, I noticed lights in the sky, moving at the same speed and parallel with each other.Upon seeing them, it turned out there were two more sets of lights.  One of the sets of lights, reminded me of a colon symbol from the keyboard, moving straight over my house and over the trees.  Following the same path was another set of lights only the looked as if a colon was on it's side.The third set of lights, broke the formation by going diagonally across the sky.  It seemed to have started off with them but ended up breaking away, still staying parallel with itself.  It was almost as if the sets of lights were attached in the pairs by a bar.These lights didn't blink, and they weren't slow like a plane.

297,"Moving white spheres seen by two people, while camping in northern Wisconsin.On October 13, 2016, my friend and I were camping at the Spearhead Point Campground in Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in WI, we were camping at the P4 camp site.  This was our fourth night at the campground, and the first night since we had been there that the sky was clear.  It was about 7:00 pm, and we had just finished eating supper.  I had been looking at the sky, because I enjoy looking at the stars when there is little light pollution.  I had noticed a bright, white sphere in the eastern sky, and I had been trying to figure out what it was.  It was too big for a star, and I thought that it might be a planet.  I periodically glanced at the object trying to figure out what planet it could be.My friend and I were talking about the events of the week, and I was sitting at the picnic table looking at the object, when all of the sudden it started to move, slowly at first, then faster.  I told my friend what I was seeing (my friend is blind).  It was moving south-southeast, and had become obscured by some evergreen trees.  I ran from the picnic table, down the steps to the dock at the campground, because I thought that would give me a better view as the object moved SSE.  When I got to the dock, the object was gone.  I walked back up the stairs to the picnic table where my friend was still standing.  I told her that the object was gone by the time I got down to the dock.  I was describing the sphere to my friend, when I looked to the east again, the sphere was back.I told my friend that the sphere was back, and was describing it to her.  While I was describing the sphere, and scrambling to find a camera or our video recorder, the sphere split forming two spheres.  When it split, it appeared as though the new sphere dripped off the original sphere.  These spheres were originally aligned vertically, and then the lower sphere moved upward to be aligned horizontally.  Once the spheres were aligned horizontally, one of the spheres split again.  There were now there spheres aligned horizontally.  Each time there was a split, the spheres became smaller, and they were all bright white.  The two sphere on either side, just seemed to turn off, leaving the sphere in the middle.  That sphere began to change colors, cycling through white to red to red-orange.  This continued for about a minute, and then that sphere just turned off. The original sphere was slightly bigger than a BB held at arm’s length, and it was oriented approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  Since I’m not familiar with the area, I don’t have an estimate of how far away the object might have been from the campground.  The object(s) did not make any noise, and I didn’t see anything like an exhaust trail.  The overall sighting lasted around 40-50 minutes.  About 20 minutes after all of the objects had disappeared, a plane flew over our campground.  It was easy to hear the plane’s engine, you could see the outline of the plane in the sky, as well as see the aviation lights blinking on and off. Unfortunately, we did not get a photo of the object(s).  My camera had fallen out of my backpack on to the ground under the picnic table, and I didn’t see it there until the next morning.  We did get the video camera out, but were unable to record the object(s) due to a camera malfunction (?). Both my friend and I are in our early 50s, and have postgraduate degrees.  I work in law enforcement, and my friend is not currently employed. We grew up together in Northeast Iowa.

It hovered there as I stared at it… (maybe 3-4 minutes maybe a little longer…  maximum 5 minutes), and I asked my daughter to come out and look at it with me and my toddler followed behind her.  We all watched it, because it was extremely bright (white and red lights)… brighter than any airplanes or stars in the sky.  It was in the southwestern direction of the sky approximately, according to my compass.  It stayed there for like 3 more minutes (+/-) and then it started to move, at first very very slowly from its position (positioned low on the horizon and then moved upwards then it headed slowly toward the south for a little)…  at this point, my daughter decided to try to get a picture of it with my laptop, so I ran inside to get it…! when I came back out with the laptop it began moving quickly (very quickly) across the sky (in a southeastern direction, so it moved diagonally across the sky – first located at western corner of property direction (compass direction), then moved up (rose higher in the sky) and headed south, and then at the same level in the sky southeast)… within approximately 1 minute it had traveled approximately 30 +/- miles (headed from somewhere around: &lt;estimated starting location&gt;:  Reynoldson, NC  36.509707,  –76.840809) -- Gates, NC to Suffolk, VA -- (stopped keeping track of the time for the speed of it at approximately (Chesapeake, VA 36.695069,  –76.459865)!!!

331,"Two VERY fast and hard to miss UFO's at Yosemite National Park in Slow Motion.This is cellphone footage from a friend of mine out west that was sent to me. He was filming the landscape and making funny ""blinking eye"" motions over the phone camera for comedic effects.  He actually did not notice that he captured a video of a UFO until later when he was doing a slow motion effect to his footage. He told me he couldn't see the object at all at normal speed.The first object appears flying through the sky and slightly banking to its right extremely fast (even while in slow motion) and completely silent, the second one is barely visible but it appears shortly after the first one from the top right and continues to the top left, near the end of its flight path the footage returns to normal speed and if stepped forward you can see it start to ascend.  I noticed that the second one sort of wobbles as it flies, like a balancing plate.We were both in the military together and agreed that as far as we knew, our aircraft technology hadn't gotten so good to be THAT fast AND SILENT at the same time.

338,"There was so much unusual activity, starting with a helicopter, and ending with various ufos. Please read full story of what we sawMy boyfriend and I went to see Tech N9ne at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado on October 9th, 2016. When we got there we stood outside of the concert to smoke a cigarette when we noticed a helicopter flying over. I thought it seemed odd because you could not actually see what the helicopter looked like, but based off of it's lights and sound you could tell how close it was. The first time it went by I hardly heard it until it had gone by, but the second time it flew directly above us and hovered for a minute or two. It was very loud, very big for what I've seen news type helicopters look like, but again, I could still not actually see the helicopter itself, I only state this based off of where it's lights were placed.  After a minute of it sitting there and me watching this, a man came over the security guards walkie-talkie who happened to be standing on the staircase we were at the bottom of, and he stated ""Looks like our helicopter 'friend' i! s back"". I then looked up at the security guard who was staring up at the helicopter almost concerned and confused. I continued to watch him and judge his reaction before he glanced down and noticed me watching for reassurance, he then just walked down the stairs, into the building.  The helicopter came back maybe one more time after that, but it wasn't as weird as before, and it did not hover again.After this incident we heard the music kicking up and decided to go jump back into the crowd, when we got to our spot we noticed tons of unusual activity happening in the skies above the Red Rocks stage.  Off to the left of where we were looking there was about 5 lights spaced out sporadically in the same general vacinity, but they didn't move. We then noticed 3 off to the right of the stage that were just as bright as the other 5, and didn't move.  The five off to the left would get brighter and dimmer, some dimmed out and ""flew"" away as if a plane would.. some would just completely dim out and disappear.  The 3 off to the left did the same, until they all disappeared.  But the ones on the right dimmed and moved until there were 3 left, which eventually all dimmed out to nothing once again. We watched this happen multiple times, in different ways.  At one point we saw one light flying through the sky which seemed to have an LED light shinning from it, it didn't look li! ke the normal plane lights, it was much brighter.  We continued to watch and witness these ""strange"" flying objects, or just sitting lights at points.  At another point towards the end I noticed that there was this much larger strange orange glowing orb which seemed to be on the surface of some hills way off in the distance more towards Castle Rock, and it would flash and disappear, then reappear on the hill next to it.  This happened 3 different times before it stayed on the 3rd hill, where it flashed rarely, but it continued to still flash occasionally.The unknown activity seemed to slow down more and more until the concert ended, and then I no longer noticed them.  We just thought it was all very strange and thought we would share our experience since many others may have witnessed this too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

343,"Third Goleta sighting in five weeks.My daughter and I were driving home at dusk heading west.  I was telling her about the virtues of looking up quite a lot.  One sees all sorts of things; bugs, birds, stars, satellites, etc.  I decided to glance up out of the side window of the car and saw an aircraft seemingly triangular in shape.  The dusky light made it difficult to discern an actual shape.  There were three lights on the object; one on the nose of bright white magnitude -7 appearance, one at each ""wingtip"", port side red, starboard side amber, each of similar magnitude to the front light.  At first the object seemed to be a fighter jet at an approximate altitude of 500 ft traveling directly over the suburb of Goleta.  It traveled over the top of our vehicle on a banked trajectory at which point I told my daughter to look up and out of her side window.  She immediately located the object and noticed that only the wing lights remained visible but in a matter of seconds appeared white in color.  There were no flashing lights.  The object's trajectory became due north and, instead of planing off as a typical jet aircraft will do, the object seemed to maintain a strait line up at about 10 degrees and continued due north becoming seemingly a hundred miles away in a matter of thirty more seconds or so.  It eventually curved a bit before disappearing still well above the northern horizon.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was looking further across where the cloud came from and then I saw another cloud coming that was similar to the one we had initially seen.  This cloud, however, seemed to grow in size significantly as it left our view.   At this time, I noticed a small black dot which I had first nearly disregarded as being a bird.  Upon closer inspection of it, I noticed that it had a light that blinked, which then made me think it must be a plane, but I noticed that there were no wings whatsoever, and then I saw the glint of the sun off of the right side of it revealing it as a perfect sphere.

It was perfectly spherical and had a white blinking light that went off periodically with absolutely zero sound accompanying it.  It was not very flashy at all very basic seeming.

PD))I was in a local parking lot talking in the phone with a friend.  It's a parking lot with several businesses in it, restaurants and stores.  I was facing east.  Around 8:45 p.m. I started to see about 30- 40 lights shoot up into the sky.  There was roof tops in my way but it appeared to be shooting up from ground maybe 500 feet away from me.  They were orange/yellow color.  After shooting up and the lights moving down the sky, forming a chevron like pattern, I was able to snap 2 different photos from my cell.  I then decided to drive towards where this was happening, because I wanted to get a closer look, and also was trying to figure out what it was that I was seeing.  So as I was driving towards it, the lights went into triangle shapes, and then I saw a HUGE V.  The V was stationary.  By that time I had pulled into another parking lot and had a great view, got out of my car and went to take a photo, the lights from the V then shut off, only 1 remained.  I snapped a photo of that.  The one light remained for about 5-10 minutes before phasing out.  I could clearly see what looked like a mothership above the V lights.  The other lights I saw that took formation, different formations, seem to be like smaller craft going to the bigger craft.  The thing is, no one else seem to see it that night or at least I've not heard any reports.  I kept checking  social media, I asked a few people if they saw anything in the sky that night, no one else seems to of seen it.  I reached out to four different ex military men, some are family, a couple friends. I showed them the photos, and they have all said they have never seen anything like it and that when you zoom in the photos I have, it is pretty crazy and creepy.

366,"Four identical objects observed Near OAFB by two adults.START TIME:  Approximately 2010 Hrs   END TIME:  Approximately 2030 Hrs I took my dog out to relieve himself just before going to the store, when I noticed an object with flight characteristics which were not similar to any usual air craft. The object was ovular in shape and had lights that were intermittently visible.  The lights were an orane-red and yellow color (normal aircraft, even military, have green or red on either wing tip).  The object was dark grey in color and seemed to sort of vanish and re-appear suddenly.  The object rotated about 240 degrees along its longitudinal axis while maintaining a steady trajectory from SSW (Somewhere west of Platsmouth) to NNE (towards downtown Omaha/Missouri River).  It is also important to note that the craft was not uniform in shape, as it rotated, it revealed smooth flat sides along the forward and aft sections of this exotic object. I immediately ruled out celestial bodies such as stars, planets, meteoroids and so forth due to the altitude which I estimate was about 5,000-10,000 feet from ground level. The object emitted no detectable sound despite it's proximity and high rate of speed.  I was able to confirm that it was in atmosphere due to the fact that it was passing between the clouds and myself.  I could also rule out any sort of illusion or phenomenon as the object was in plain view the most of the time I was observing it.  When it seemed to vanish, I was still able to predict where it would re-appear and begin tracking it again as it moved steadily.I observed this first object until I could no longer see it all the while, trying to get my wife's attention who was inside getting our kids ready to go.  She finished that about one minute after the initial object disappeared.  After about two more  minutes pass by.  At this time, as we are loading the kids in the truck, both, my wife and I observed a second object matching the description of the first.  This object exhibited the same behaviors and travelled what I perceived was the same route.Upon seeing the second object my wife and I changed our plans and decided to drive around in the rural area two miles south of Bellevue Nebraska.  Upon beginning our drive, going west on Capehart toward 36th Street, we observed two more objects matching the description of the aforementioned, flying on the same path and a similar altitude.  This previously mentioned observation occurred approximately 4 minutes after the second object left visual contact.  Upon driving around in the rural areas we observed no further objects.Additional thought tells me that if there were only two objects, they would have to begin traveling from the point of final visual contact to the point of initial contact at an amazing speed while deviating significantly from their originally observed path.  It is much more probable that there were a total of 4 objects.To the reader:  Be advised that I am a seasoned military member who lives near an AFB.  I see various craft on a daily basis at all hours and during all weather conditions yearly.   While this occurred after sunset, the sky was mostly clear and there was near maximal lighting from the moon.  I am well versed in aircraft and discerning between any sort of optical illusion or phenomena.  Based on these circumstances, I conclude that these were some form of manufactured, atypical craft which were intelligently controlled.  I draw no other conclusions.I attempted to record the second occurrence on my phone but as you can imagine the video quality does not do the event justice.

Four days after the game, I uploaded the photos to my computer and was intrigued by what I saw in the photo of the rooftop crowd.  A fuzzy glowing object was in the sky in the distance to the north.

370,"UFO (Real bright light) over Lake Beseck in Middlefield, CtI live out by Lake Beseck in Middlefield, Ct  This past Saturday (10/08/16) in the early evening i came out of my home to bring some firewood inside since the nights have started to get chilly.While i was walking over to the woodpile i noticed a bright white light over the mountain in the area where the Mountain Side Resort is from a WSW direction. At that time i didn't pay any mind to it cuz i just thought it was a aircraft or maybe the planet Venus. Venus can get real bright at times and could fool someone too. So after bringing a load of wood in i went back out to get some smaller starter wood with my bucket and i noticed again that this light had gotten closer and now was over the southern area of the lake. This was no planet.At that point i stopped to take a good look at it but i couldn't tell if it had stopped or was continuing to come in my direction. This thing was bright and it looked like there was a smaller but just as bright light just under the main light.To find out if it was moving still, i a lined myself (my eyes) with a telephone cable that hanged from a street light across from my property in such a way to see if it would appear from behind the cable.  Sure enough it came from behind the cable so that told me it was moving but not fast at all.Keeping my eye on this thing, i went into my car to get a pair of  field glasses (maybe 10x25) not too powerful but enough to see it through the lens.  All i could see was these lights that were too bright (blob), no markings or anything, couldn't make out a shape to it at all, it was just too bright. No sound at all, no vapor trail, just floating along in a ENE direction, at a angle that would have put it right over my home.As I'm looking at it coming closer, all of a sudden it just disappeares!!, like someone just hit a switch and turned the lights off.  There was no clouds anywhere in the sky.  The moon was up but it was futher to the south.  The sky at the time was i guess what u would call in twilight.  The stars were just starting to appear, dark but not real dark.  Not sure of the time but it was around 1845-1900 hrs.I've seen other things in the sky at night, ISS, meteours, shooting stars etc, but nothing like this object or anything this bright.  I suppose it could have been a drone that someone was flying but at night??, no sound from any props, and the distance this thing traveled from, with one hell of a big light or two.  I don't think so. It just disappeared.  I looked further to the ENE direction to see if it reappeared but nothing.  I continued to scan the rest of the sky in all directions but still nothing more.One min it was there and the next min it just disappeared, gone!!

I looked into the western sky where the sun had already set, and to the south of Thumb Butte, hovering stationary over the ridgeline, was the strange object.  I wrote the following journal entry less than half an hour later:  ""At 1813 I spotted a hovering object in the western sky.  It pretty much remained stationary, but turned end upon end and rotated.  The object looked like six ""balloons"" tethered to a central point [here I made a drawing in my journal].  There were no lights on the object.

I got up to look out my bedroom window.  I have logged two UFO sightings on previous occasions within the last couple of years from this same bedroom window but did not keep any records, myself.  I have reported one to MUFON and another to National UFO Reporting Center.  I have seen about four other sightings over the years directly over the city of Ottawa and Gatineau.  I sometimes look out the bedroom window to check for UFO's especially at sundown and during the night.  There is usually one red air-ambulance helicopter go close by once or twice a day with pulsating red and white lights with characteristic sound.  One of the previous UFO sightings was of a very large white light and with a definite round-shaped red light of same size in its center which looked something like a spot light from a short distance away vantage point. This was about 2-3 miles away.  The reason I am saying this is that these UFO's could be trying to imitate helicopter lights!  Anyway, I looked out my bedroom window and the Western sky was misty.  There was one large star to be seen, probably Mars or Venus at about 30 degrees.  I looked out of the corner of my eye, as I sometimes do, to see if there were any fainter stars near-by.  I thought I saw a couple and one of them was red.  They were very small and faint, and much smaller than the first star seen.  As I kept looking, the red one seemed to get bigger.  Then, I detected it to be moving West to North.  It came to be within about 5-10 miles, I think, no sound, window open.  The red light kept flashing at about once a second as it moved across the sky.  It was fluttering up and down and would lunge forward at tremendous speed every 3-4 seconds.

413,"Teal colored light ring sighted on a low altitude straight flight path for 30 plus seconds east of St. Paul, MN.While attending a small yard campfire, I sighted a perfect circle of blue-green/teal colored light.  It resembled a fluorescent ring light fixture on a straight south-north path parallel, but just east of I-694.  From my perspective, its altitude was 800 to 1200 feet, appearing to be the size of a 14 to 16 inch pizza pan in vertical position.  As a former Navy pilot, I would estimate its speed equivalent to that of aircraft on approach to Holman Airport in St. Paul, just prior to entering the landing pattern.  Earlier in the day, I observed a twin engine aircraft traveling in the opposite direction on a S/W course toward the metro area.  The UFO I sighted appeared to be at a similar altitude and speed, and it never deviated its course, remaining in sight approximately 30 seconds.  The skies were totally clear.

There, in the light of the setting sun which had just gone down below the horizon, the witness saw an object at approximately the height of a light cumulus cloud layer.  These were not high altitude clouds and only partially covered the sky. The object was brightly shining in the sunlight remaining at that higher altitude, looked like two light colored triangles aligned to each other and pointing vertically upward (further description may be added later with drawing if possible).  The object was very steady and did not waver or bob about; it was as steady as a rock, seemed to be firmly controlled.  No noise was heard from the object.The witness said the object was emitting two light beams or columns of light extending downward from the object a few times its length.  It looked as though these two beams or columns of light were propelling the object upward. The light beams were not flames but more like pillars of light, very geometrical and shaped like cylinders, extended downward as stated, but did not trail off but rather seemed to have a strictly limited beam length.The object began moving upward slowly; then after a few seconds the object seemed to either accelerate rapidly upward in that direction or simply ""disappeared."" It was not covered by clouds but seemed to either zoom out of sight with incredible speed or ""wink out.""  This description is written secondhand and will be corrected later if need be.

The base is really just serving as a ""garage"" for the planes, he said.The complaints are mainly because of the 5 a.m. takeoffs that are waking people up and have also frightened people because they are so loud and atypical.  The actual flight paths vary depending on wind conditions and many other factors, Bishop said.Pilots are taking off so early because of the time difference between here and Europe. When they leave at 5 a.m., it is already 10 a.m. in England, Bishop said.http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/westover_5_am_fighter_jets_hea.html",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Belchertown, MA",Occurred : 10/3/2016 05:00  (Entered as : 10/03/16 5:00),Posted: 10/11/2016,Reported: 10/3/2016 3:05:45 AM 03:05,Shape: Fireball

The flickering is similar to seeing a single star that flickers at night.  All the lights are so bright as though you're staring into an LED bulb from afar.  These lights hover in one place and will slowly move up and down and side to side making figure ""8"" motions, sometimes moving horizontal and or vertical, and sometimes they will simply disappear as though someone turned off the switch.  I have been observing these lights since 2013 and they're consistent with their behavior.  I have nicknamed this phenomenon as the ""alien planet or Alien Star.""

As I  reached the bottom of the driveway I turned left (west) to put my bundles into my trash containers.  As I looked up after turning left I was astounded.  I saw two gigantic beams of light coming from the sky.  The beams of light were aimed at the ground right beyond our neighborhood.  From my perspective, the beams made  more than a 45 degree slant angle from the sky to the ground.  These beams were huge.  The width of these beams were about 80 feet and 60 feet in diameter respectively.  These beams had very little spread.  They were located about 1/2 mile away from my location.  The beams were more of a washed out white.  The beam edges were very sharp. The beams were very close together.  There was a distance of about 20 feet separating one beam from the next.  The trees on my left were preventing me from seeing the source of these beams.  Then bang both beams were turned off very suddenly.  I heard no noise.  I saw no craft.  I was astounded.  I know of no aerial or atmospheric phenomena that can cause such beams.  A long time ago WPAFB were testing airborne to ground bright beams.

450,"Lights in sky I thought it was a shooting starI got up early to walk my dog before heading to Sjc airport from my mothers house in Watsonville, ca.  I live near Dallas tx.  The sighting occurred about 30 min or so before sunrise.  I looked up into the sky an noted how clear it was compared to home I then looked over at my dog and saw from my prerfrial vision almost directly above what I thought was a shooting star heading south.  I looked at it and focused on it and saw that it was not a single shooting star but a cluster 4 or 5 points of light all moving together at high rate of speed and different intensities, but each one looked no different than any other star in the sky only moving at high rate.  As I watched it move towards the horizon I saw two of the lights swap places once and then twice.  As it neared the horizon it seemed to slow down as it should from my perspective only more than I would expect and it also turned to the east and went behind a tree and house.  During the first half of the sighting I was looking for a tail or sparks coming off the cluster but didn't see any.  Due to the odd trajectory of this, I suspect it was over central or Southern California and when it turned east, was heading for Edwards afb or groom lake.  I also suspect the points of light swapping places was in fact sunlight reflecting off a shiny surface.  There was no sound from it and no sonic boom.  There was a passenger jet at high altitude I noticed to the east of the sighting going north and within a minute of the sighting I could hear the jet but no noise from the area the lights were seen.

453,"Strange orange light flew overhead.	On the morning of October 2, 2016, at just before 1:30 AM, I wandered over to the open shipping door at my workplace to grab a bit of fresh air.   I was looking outside when an orange light caught my attention.  The light was to the southeast of where I was standing.  I assumed it was an aircraft coming in to land at the airport—this is something that I see at night all the time as my workplace is just to the east of the airport.  The light was about the same size and color as the incandescent street lamps that were across the street, maybe 100 feet away.	As the light approached I became very curious.  When normal aircraft do their approaches you often start out seeing just the bright white 'headlight' but you eventually see the red and green lights on the wings and tail.  This object did not display any other lights.  The light continued heading directly towards me, flying on a northwest course.  As it was going to pass directly over the building I went outside into the parking lot so I could continue observing it.	The light passed directly over me at what I assumed was the normal altitude for landing aircraft.  I did not see any other lights—just the orange light.  I did not see the shape of an aircraft which is very strange to me as at that altitude I would have seen at least the outline of a conventional aircraft, even at night.  There was no sound.  The light did not change shape or luminosity.  It moved at roughly the same speed as a normal aircraft.  There was a light breeze at the time but I don't recall the direction.	As the light passed overhead I saw what looked to me like a 'shock-wave' in front of the light.  This was the only time I saw anything other than the light itself.  The light continued on its northwest course, moving past the roof-line of the building.  I backed up in the parking lot to try to regain sight of it but failed to do so.  The total time spent observing the light was 1-2 minutes.	I do not know what to think of this light.  I have worked nights at this location for over 5 years and have never seen anything like this.  I see normal aircraft in the sky at night all the time, several times a night.  This thing did not look like a normal aircraft.  I suppose it could have been a meteor but I feel it was moving too slowly for that.  I feel it was moving too precisely to be a balloon, flare or firework, and the light was too consistent and bright for that, unless I drastically overestimated its altitude.

470,"Three large bright lights hovering for 2-3 minutes.At 20:48 hours on 10/01/2016 I was standing on my deck (Southern Exposure) overlooking Silver Lake.  I witnessed a craft of unknown origin while waiting for my Daughter and Granddaughter.  We were going to pick up my Wife from work in Brewer.  I was looking to the east and was watching what I thought was an airplane in its flight path for Bangor International Airport, while I waited outside.  It was not emitting any noise.At that point, I noticed the perspective of the lights had not changed; I stared a little closer studying them for any changes.  It was hovering at approximately 300 to 500 feet (estimated) in altitude.  It appeared to be static for approximately two minutes with three very bright and large lights, all side by side.I called to my daughter to come outside to make sure that I had seen what was going on in front of me.  At that point in an arc the craft ascended slowly to the north and west and had changed configuration.  The lights grew wider apart and then after the maneuver leveling off at what appeared angels 7 and proceeded in a north-northwesterly direction.  Based on my intimate knowledge of the area I estimated the craft to be 5 miles away from the point where I was standing.  These large bright lights reflected on the lake even though the object was not over the lake but in fact was a couple miles beyond it.Initially the lights were close together almost touching, and then spread apart, then returning together.  In perspective the lights were two (side view) with one red light.We did not have a camera or cell phone handy to take pictures, but were mesmerized by the action(s) of this craft of unknown origin.  It took approximately 60 seconds for the craft to traverse the distance behind the horizon.  My daughter and I conquered that we had seen the same thing(s) and wrote down all of the information.

They flew slowly North over our neighborhood at the same height it appeared until it was so far north that they almost disappeared entirely.  After about 15 minutes they came closer and brighter again but were much higher up in they sky and were directly above us to the West.

473,"Bright blue flying saucer near Stephenville, TX, with a small plane following it.I was driving from Stephenville to Fort Worth.  It was a clear night without any clouds or rain. I was on I-20 heading East.  On the eastern horizon I saw a bright blue flying disk heading towards me and flying directly over the road.  It was flying very high at a planes altitude.  Slightly  lower and to the right of the blue flying saucer was a small plane.The small plane had a red light on the left wing and a white light on the right wing.  The plane's lights were flashing lights on both wings.  It was much smaller than a commercial plain.  It was triangular shaped and flying at a plane's speed while following this blue flying saucer.  It was not directly behind it but flying slightly lower and to the right of it.  The plane did follow the flying disk, going the exact same route.The bright blue flying saucer was twice as large as the plane and flying higher.  It was as bright as a star and was flying incredibly fast.  The saucer came from the East and was directly heading West.  It seemed like it was going as fast as a shooting star, but it had no light trail or haze.  The saucer flew directly parallel to I-20.  I watched it directly pass over me threw my sun roof.  I saw the bottom of the flying saucer.  It apeared to be a perfect circle with a clearly defined blue rim.  Even though it was very bright it was not fuzzy around the edges like a light or a star.  The saucer kept the perfectly defined circle shape.  It flew at an impossible speed, making it from as far as I could see on the Eastern horizon to the Western horizon behind me in 1 to 2 seconds.  The small plane followed behind it but at a much slower plane speed.  The flying saucer flew in a straight line.The bright blue flying saucer was so fast that I doubted if others on the road even caught a glimpse of it.  It was too fast for me to get to my phone.I also saw what I thought was a meteor crash the last time I drove from Stephenville to Fort Worth.  It was on September 9th 2016 at 01:00.

Synopsis of Pepe’s interview in his own words: “On 01Oct16 I took some panoramic photos of El Morro across the Bay of San Juan (El Morro is an old Spanish fortress). I also wanted to take photos of the ferry boat. My wife also took some photos using her camera, a Sony digital model DSC-HX200V. Neither one noticed any hovering object (UFO). On 21Oct16 I decided to review the photos we had taken on 01Oct16. When I zoomed-in on the images I realized there was an unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), a.k.a. UFO, in several of the photos: four (4) taken with the Nikon and one (1) taken with the Sony.”  Analysis of photos: Pepe’s camera is a Nikon digital model D90.Pepe advised the date and time settings of the camera are accurate except that the time is off by 12 hr, meaning the photos were taken during the day (PM) and not at night (AM). Details of Photos: The object appears to have moved away from El Morro and then back closer to it, apparently always maintaining the same height of a few hundred feet. Sailing boats were in the bay at the time of the sighting. A ferry boat moved left to right (N to S). Photo 0584 was taken on 01Oct16 at 1:22 PM. Object is observed apparently hovering directly over El Morro or on the water close to it.EXIF version: 0221 F-stop: f/10 Exposure Time: 1/400 sec ISO Speed: ISO-250 Focal Length: 50 mm Max.

It is tilted relative to the vertical axis by approximately 45 degrees. In the image, the left side is seen lower. The object appears to have on the top a very bright dome in the middle. The light of the dome appears to emanate from it, and not just reflected from the sun. The bottom of the object is observed to be very dark. Of particular interest is the observed concentric halo around the object.

There were multiple lights but it was far enough away it looked like a point of light, couldn't quite make out a shape.  One white light was constantly on, the other (2 or more) lights were blinking colors.  I used a star light to base the movements.  It would hover for a few seconds then jerk in any direction and then hover again.  Reminded me of the seemingly random movements of an insect.  I took a 5 min video on my phone and stayed at least another 5 min holding my dog watching the event.  The object stayed in the same area of the sky (between two close trees) from my vantage, and moving away from me southbound slightly.  I am familiar with the movements of known aircraft including personal drones.  At first, I thought It was a drone, but the movements were inconsistent with a drone because there was no acceleration or deceleration, ! just movement and seemingly perfect hovering.  There is an airport in the area.  The clouds moved in during the sighting and the unknown light was below the cloud layer.

Clear sky, and I was admiring the stars.  I then noted a strange light in the Eastern sky.  Very difficult to describe.  It was multi-colored, red, white , blue.  The colors shifted, or pulsed.  It seemed to hover, but did make a very slow Southerly progression.  After viewing it for approximately a half hour, I went an woke my wife.  I didn't do this easily, but felt she would be upset if I told her what I'd observed and didn't let her know.  She was as awed as I was.  She grew up in Old Ford Town, which is the neighborhood of the old Wold Chamberlin Field, and right close to MSP.  So, obviously she is not new to seeing aircraft in the night sky.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing.  We were watching with binoculars, and we could come up with no explanation for this sighting.  Obviously, not a plane, nor a helicopter.

This was the evening of September 30, 2016, approximately 7:30 pm in the backyard of a co-workers home there were about 15-20 persons in attendance, when someone asked what is that?  I looked up to see what was a red light illuminating to a bright white light growing in intensity and size to 1/4 of the moon, but not directed at the ground just in a straight forward direction.  There was no visible shape or size of the object, again it was dark outside.  It was moving from a northerly direction, to the south towards us at a fairly rapid rate coming from the Pacific ocean inland.  It seemed to be approximately 1200 to 1500 feet in altitude.  The object all of a sudden the object stopped on a dime in mid-flight and became static (hovering).  There were no navigation lights (the usual red or white flashing lights).  The craft never turned or rotated to where the bright light could be seen turning direction.  After staying static for approximately 5-8 minutes, it then began to go in reverse at the same speed and identical flight path just like it had come into view (back over the Pacific ocean).  After about a minute and a half the bright white light turned off and changed to dim red color and slowly faded as it moved further away over the ocean.This flight exhibition was performed 3 separate times at about 10 minute intervals in between appearances that evening and witnessed by all in attendance in that backyard that evening.  Same flight path, same white lighted pattern-faded to red over the ocean return flight, same no sound performance.Waiting to hear either blade or propeller wash sound or jet engine sounds, this craft made not one sound, ""ABSOLUTELY"" nothing.  Either during approach-return flight pattern or while it was static.  I've been around alot of aircraft in my lifetime, my grandfather being a pilot since the 1930's and working on alot of military air bases, I have never experience anything flying that does not make any sound at that close of  elevation to the ground.We happen to be close to a couple of municipal airports and Point Mugu, a naval station which is 3-4 miles away.

After a few seconds the object changed course to due south as it approached where I was standing.  It travelled south slowly away from my position but the appendages similar to bi-plane wings or solar panels had changed and appeared to be on the west or right side of the object.I called my daughter out to see the object.  Her first reaction was “it’s a plane”.  I sort of disputed that by saying “where’s the wings”.  She said “well it doesn’t seem to have any”.  At that point the object was cigar shaped with appendages on its right side.  We watched it continue south and I looked away to come inside the house and my daughter said it disappeared.  I looked one last time and didn’t see it.Summarizing: the object had physical shape, brilliantly reflected the setting sun producing a gleaming effect, made no noise, had no blinking lights, traveled in very steady manner, changed direction and shape.",Duration:3-4 minutes,"Location: Marietta, GA",Occurred : 9/29/2016 19:15  (Entered as : 9/29/2016 19:15),Posted: 10/11/2016,Reported: 10/3/2016 2:25:59 AM 02:25,Shape: Changing

The video also helps estimate distances).  Difficult to estimate distances but whilst viewing I thought probably 400 metres high and each moving horizontally, roughly like a pendulum and its mirror image, with a 1000-2000 metres estimated horizontal movement.  Background was clear deep blue with many almost still standard clouds clearly visible.  I was located directly under the east end of the horizontal movement, where the strange clouds were each more or less stationery for a couple of seconds with each pass.  I think this was probably the best location to view. The moving clouds were almost the same white colour as the standard clouds, but with a slightly grainy texture, and slightly whiter.  At no time could I see though the two strange clouds to the clear deep blue background.  Viewed for about 20 minutes, and then viewed again about an hour later with same observations except that the blue background was darker.  Assumed that the repeated movement had continued for this hour duration.

The object began to move back and forth in a way that was not conventional away from me until I could no longer see it.  Then another identical light streaked down and did the same thing as the first light and after I could no longer see that one a third one streaked down and did the same as the first two, each time this happened it took maybe 10 seconds each at most from streaking down, dancing and disappearing.  Then I saw nothing for about 10 seconds and I threw down my cigar and rushed into my house to get my phone to see if I could get any video of this.  I ran back outside into my back yard and waited about 1 minute and the light returned but this time suddenly appearing motionless like a star in the horizon and then moving down low like before but instead of moving into the distance away from me the light danced up and down and back and forth sometimes appearing in two places at the same time. I tried to shoot video but I can see nothing on it but lights from a manufacturing plant across the street and some traffic.  After about 15 minutes I then noticed to my Southwest a group of 3 white lights appear and streak across a small portion of sky and immediately followed by small groups of white lights moving streaking sideways across the same small portion of sky sometimes as many as 5 at a time in some weird formation.  I thought theses lights were a long way from me maybe around 10 miles out but then one moved between me and a telephone pole that was only 30 feet away from me.  I thought at first that my eyes were playing a trick on me so I moved away from the pole and only one of the white lights to my Southwest moved and for about 15 seconds stayed between me and the pole.

I noticed at this 1/6 speed that it was on camera for less than 2-3 seconds total which indicated to me that its speed was unbelievably fast.  Upon watching it over and over again, at different speeds, different time frames etc, it appears to be as best I could make out some type of aircraft (of Unknown origin).

576,"Glowing orb hovers in southern Utah for over four hours.On Sunday, September 25, 2016, I was in my backyard and saw a bright object in the sky and  went into the house and told my wife that there was a drone flying over our yard.  It looked to me to be about 600-700 feet in the air, above the mesa behind us.  I watched it move slowly along the mesa from west to east until it was out of sight.The following day, Monday, the object appeared again but was higher in the sky.  My wife came out to look at it, and I called some neighbors also.  This was approximately 3:30-4:00 pm.  One neighbor had a rifle with a high-powered scope, and some binoculars.  He said that the object was definitely not a drone, but looked like a disk.  He described the object as having a red light and was glowing.  His estimate was the object was at about 1500 feet.   He apparently took photos, but unfortunately he left town for his work, and we do not have access to his photos yet.I took pictures with my everyday camera but there is not a really good shot.  The object appeared to change shape from round to triangular.    I found an old pair of binoculars that were water damaged. I did manage to get a better look.  My wife and I both saw the object as a glowing orb; it was luminescent and slowly shifted its shape and colors.  Our small camera picked up bright pink “auras” or “energy waves,” which were also sometimes visible to the naked eye.At one point a low-flying jet appeared out of nowhere, and not on a regular flight route or elevation. It looked almost like two aircraft were flying together, one just above the other.  A few minutes later, another plane flew by.  My wife describes them as “ghost” planes, because they were  so out of place and looked like they were in a haze.The object moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, towards the west and the setting sun.   When the sun disappeared behind the mesa, the object remained in the same place above the mesa.  I made a small fire and stayed outside well after dark to watch the object.   Around 8:15 pm, I saw it become slightly larger and brighter, then it suddenly extinguished.   My wife and I are over 60 years old, and neither of us has  seen anything like this ever.  We have lived in our home for 18 years and have never seen anything unusual in our skies.",Duration:4 hours,"Location: Apple Valley, UT",Occurred : 9/26/2016 16:00  (Entered as : 09/26/16 16:00),Posted: 9/30/2016,Reported: 9/29/2016 12:25:23 PM 12:25,Shape: Changing

About two blocks further down the hill i looked south and saw three VERY bright lights in an isoceles triangle formation.  I made a sudden Uturn to head back to higher ground and pulled over to take some pictures.  As minutes passed the lights moved across the horizon but stayed in the formation.  I then noticed as i scanned the skyline, of which i had about 180 degree field of vision i took notice of an inordinate amount of other aircraft and helicopters flying around rapidly.  From where i stood i could see clear for at least 20 miles. When i would unfocus my eyes on a darker area of the sky, other faint! lights throughout the sky became visible, some moving slowly, others staying in place.  After a few minutes i got back in the car to head home.  On the 10 minute drive from the hill to my house I saw four helicopters and what i belive to be a military jet, all moving quickly and at varying altitudes. I captured some very clear shots of what i saw and upon returning home pulled them up on my laptop to adjust contrast and other photo settings.

Over the tree tops were 8 bright red lights traveling reasonably slowly from W to S, seemed to be over South Mountain.

Upon returning outside, only the last red light (the most western light) was still lit but it went out as soon as I looked at it.  There are no towers in the direction I was looking so the lights could not be the tops of such.  I continued watching the sky in that direction but nothing was there.  Right after that, the area security guard drove up and I ran to talk to him.  He said he saw them too but from an area where they showed between the trees and he assumed they were tower lights.  But, he agreed with me when we talked and he thought about it that there are no towers in that direction.  The location is Macungie, PA just west and south of Allentown, PA.

620,"Large rectangular formation of lights visible over farm house that disappeared and then reappeared, moving slowly and silently.Me, my wife, my brother, and my sister-in-law were driving to visit my in-laws at 8:45 pm.  As we came around the corner, we all noticed what we thought were lights on one of the many grain bins in the area.  However, as we got closer I realized that they were too high in the air (roughly 200 ft) to be a grain bin, plus there was no bin in that area.  The lights were roughly in a rectangular shape, four or five white lights and a small red one.  They seemed to sit still and were clearly too low to be a plane (low enough that at first they were thought to be a grain bin)  As we pulled into the house the trees momentarily obscured the view of the lights.  I parked in the driveway and my brother and I got out to look for them and they were gone.This was startling and we began to question what was going on.  My mother and father in law were sitting in the heard star gazing (it was a pristinely clear night).  They said that they saw nothing and heard nothing (which ruled out a helicopter or low flying plane).  My brother and I ran back down the road in the direction we'd come from, thinking that a change in perspective might show us what the lights were, but they were gone.  This is where it got strange...we knew they had been there, and they were stationary enough and close enough so that all four of us in the car had assumed they were part of the surrounding farm equipment....in fact, we all assumed this was the case which is why none of us commented to each other upon first seeing them.As we searched, we say a low flying, VERY slow moving, and silent line of lights in the distance....as we watched it glided over the horizon and was gone.The following morning we told the neighbor (a farmer whose lived in the area a long time) what we had seen. His response was, ""oh, you saw them too?  I've seen those four or five times before, always in the Fall.""  He continued to explain that he's seen the lights often (4-5 times) before and that they will appear, hover, and then disappear, only to reappear again somewhere else.  He even said that, in the past, they've hovered for a time and then shot off quickly.

I am a licensed commercial small UAV (drone) pilot.  And I was scouting the location in preparation for an upcoming drone shoot.We were about a quarter mile west of the airport and I witnessed an airliner making an approach and landing on runway 33—this will be important in a minute.My son is 5 and absolutely loves airplanes.  We routinely drive by the airport and hope to see aircraft take off and land as it’s a thrill for him.As we proceeded to drive over towards the airport my wife and I spotted a slow-moving unidentifiable aircraft coming in towards the airport from the north.  I estimated the aircraft to be at around 2,000 feet in altitude and moving incredibly slow.  This was alarming to me because I made a mental note just a couple of minutes earlier that airliners were utilizing runway 33, which meant that general aviation (small planes) would have been utilizing runway 1.This would have put the unidentifiable aircraft directly into the path of a departing airliner.  As the unidentifiable aircraft was in Class “C” airspace, it would not have been permitted to fly over the airport at an altitude of 2,000 feet, let alone on a heading that put it into the path of departing airliners.By this time, we are at the airport driving through the terminal and my son is enjoying the airliners.  My wife and I are trying to keep track of the unidentifiable craft as it is literally right above the airport STILL at an elevation of around 2,000 feet and moving ever so slowly towards the southeast.We lost the UFO in the clouds and thought that was the end of it. We proceeded to the cell phone waiting area on the north side of the airport where people wait for phone calls to pick up their party.  My wife found the UFO in the sky and it had changed directions completely.  It was NOW heading back the way it came from towards the North West.  I got out of my truck grabbing my cell phone in the process and tried capturing as much of it as I could.  I wish I had better footage to show you, but it’s regrettably not great.

I was living in south Nanaimo with 3 of my friends as roommates, and we were housing a couple friends who had been traveling.  Our house had a deck on the second floor with a great view of mount benson from south nanaimo.  We were all hanging out on the deck as it got dark we noticed a bright light like you would see on a plane stationary in the sky above Mount Benson.  This light was very bright and it was hovering in the sky at about the level smaller planes fly at.  We took a look at the object through a pair of binoculars and although it was hard to keep steady I could make out yellow red and blue lights along the outer edge of a disc shaped object that looked as though it was spinning.  I could see the different colored lights rotating around the edge of the object.  Beneath it looked li! ke glowing blue tentacles resembling a jellyfish's.  All my friends looked at the object through the binoculars and saw the strange spinning disc.  The object stayed in the sky for the next few hours as we lost interest.  About 3 hours after we first noticed the UFO my friend and I were sitting outside again and I was drawn to look at the object again.  Just then, I saw a huge bolt of lightning shoot up FROM THE MOUNTAIN towards the UFO.  The lightning bolt stopped a few stories below the object, and I alerted my friend, asking if she had seen it, and in the next moment a huge flash of light in the sky above the UFO.  My friend saw the second flash of light and we watched for awhile, after that, but there were no further flashes.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  There was no sound coming from the object.

The one moving left my sight all together but the one in front of my house still remains but has moved more east.  I later watched e video zoomed in and saw an object changing to several forms.  Like light caught in a crystal. I later took screen shots while the video played, showing the object in red solid circle.  The a blueish green triangular shape and then a white circle that look similar to a smoke ring.

664,"Low Loud RumbleI wish to submit a report even though I did not see nor suspect I may have heard a UAP.  The purpose of my submission is to serve as additional evidence in the event anyone else submits a report from my area.At 22:14 I heard a deep rumble of what may have been a low flying jet.  The ceiling was low due to rain clouds.  This also prevented any visual confirmation.  The sound was loud and intense.  I judge that based on how long it took, it must have been a slow craft.At 22:15 I heard a second, higher pitched craft approaching in the same direction from magnetic west to east.  The second sound overtook the first and passed it.  I make this judgement based on the doppler effect.At 22:16, the doppler effect of the second craft fades below my ability to hear it.  However, the first rumble is still loud.  Based on the doppler effect, I can determine that it has passed overhead.At 22:18 the initial deep rumble fades below my ability to hear it.As I stated before, I submit this in support of any other possible reports you may receive related to tonight from my area.

Sure enough, a MASSIVE white flash could be seen over a local mountain named MT.

About this time strange clouds cover developed around the mountain, shrouding it . This flash was extremely powerful.  It lit the whole sky and the cloud cover, but only for 1-2 seconds.  It did lit look atypical white, it was almost a glowing color.  Much to  powerful to be emergency strobe or anything civilian/commercial.  It seemed almost unbelievable. (This happened in mid July, but seemed to come from the eastern cascade ranges).  After the second and final flash, an object came over the mountain, seemingly from the source, and quickly ascended westward, with a rapid white strobe. It did not disappear, only continued to pick up speed.Soon after the flashes seemed to stop, and the clouds dissipated.

691,"Constant speed lights moving NW on 9/20/16We were at a concert at Red Butte Gardens in SLC.  At about 8:45, my friend pointed out some lights in the sky.  They were about 50.  They were in a loose formation that resembled birds flying in a flock.  They weren't blinking or flashing.  However, they were dimming and brightening at regular intervals.  The color of the lights was a blue-white and made me think of glow in the dark.  The reason I say they weren't blinking or flashing is because the way the lights dimmed and brightened looked like something was alternately blocking and then not blocking the light.  It looked like birds flapping their wings.  The lights moved slowly but at a constant speed.  When a helicopter flew in to the University hospital, it appeared to startle the lights, because the stragglers moved a little faster and the lights in the middle of the formation moved faster and clumped around the lights in the lead.  The lights continued on a straight northwest path until they faded from view.  The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes.  We didnt lose sight of them becuase of the hills behind the concert venue. We lost them because they went beyond the horizon.  They weren't planes: planes do not fly in formation that close and these lights had no blinking red lights.  They weren't birds becuase they were flying too high and this is the same reason they weren't balloons.  Also, they were too many and the sun had set over an hour earlier.  People around us were all trying to get pictures but the distance and low lights made our phone cameras useless.  After the concert, I asked the two officers at the exit if they had seen the lights as well. They both said yes, that neither of them had ever seen that before, and that they didn't know what it was either. We discussed this with our friends as we drove home.  We concluded that it couldn't  be remnants of the Chinese rocket because they weren't falling toward Earth but appeared to be traveling around it and the lights never sh! ot like meteors. Although we don't  believe in UFOs, due to the dearth of information on this phenomenon in local news, I am exploring all possibilites.

694,"Two objects standing still then circling, one disappeared then the forest lit up far in the distance no blinking ligh resembled firebalMy family and I were coming from Hillsdale, Michigan, heading to Toledo, Ohio.  We were somewhere before Assumption.  At first we thought these two objects were stars.These object stayed in the same position in the sky much of the time untill we saw one of them dissappear. We thought maybe they were far away helicopters.  The second one came back into view.  They traded places by moving in a counter clockwise circle.  They got brighter and dimmer.  When they were bright they looked almost like a lantern or a flare.  They had no blinking lights.  After the second one disappeared the other one became very bright like it caught on fire and stayed in the same position.  We were driving 65 mph approximately, but we never seemed to be driving away from them, that was why at first we thought they were stars.  The one that disappeared from view the first time became visible again.  At first it was dim and then it was very bright like the other one.  It then disappeared from view again.  My husband, my daughter and I all were trying to continually view them through the forest. When we came to a place where the closer trees were cleared we could see in the distance a great lit up area that was emitting light from the ground like a stadium would but brighter.  This area came from a huge area of forest.  The light was so white it looked blueish, almost like a florescent light.  As we got close to Toledo we stopped at a road construction stop light close to town, and we could tell that the object was moving slowly to the side, from the position it was over the tree tops.  It did not get less bright as it moved, like it was moving farther away, it also did not get brighter.  It moved very slow. I wanted to get a closer look, he did not.  We began to quarrel over going to get a closer look or not.  He drove into the outskirts of Toledo and during the time of the argument I lost sight of the object.

It flashed red and green and appeared to have the shape of a spark plug.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter hovering. But there was no movement in any direction nor did it make a sound or appear at a low enough altitude.I watched it for the better part of 10 minutes when suddenly there appeared six soft white shapes that ballooned outwards from the original flashing lights.  This new creation reminded me of a flock of birds falling into a half moon shape rather than the traditional V.

709,"Several white lights along with one orange light 5 nights in a row. Made impossible movements with quick moving and sudden stops.Beginning on the night of 9/19/16, a large orange light appeared stationary to the south of my home.  It appeared approximately 2 or 3 times the size of a regular star & had a light orange glow.  It would move very quickly in a direction and then come to an immediate stop and become stationary.  There were also 2 white lights to the west of the orange light making similar movements.  This continued until one white light slowly moved to the southwest until out of sight, then the 2nd white light moved west until out of sight, and the orange light moved south until out of sight after about 3 hours of hovering in the same area of the sky.  These same lights came back to the same area for the next 4 days and did the same things.  The 2nd & 3rd  night the orange light wasnt as large as the 1st night because I believe it was a little higher altitude or farther from me.  The 3rd night after the 3 lights began to move away I noticed a large white sparkling light coming from the Northwest towards my property.  It then stopped and began with the same movements and sudden stops as the others. The 4th night the orange light was larger again and there were several more of the white lights, I recall probably 6 or 7, that were in all directions in the sky.  Each night the was an unusual amount of planes that kept flying in the general area of the orange light.  My property may get the random plane, but this was 7-12 planes per night.  The last night I was out watching it was a crystal clear night.  Not a cloud in the sky. I noticed a strangely shaped ""cloud"" to the northeast right above my property.  There was a large white orb shaped light moving around in the ""cloud"" and it began changing strange colors as the orb moved.  It eventually went completely dark.

I walked out to my patio and saw a black triangle hovering over murphy canyon area just south of   Browns field.  I have seen this craft before and I have no doubt it was a tr-3b.  I filmed one in El Cajon, CA on 12-30-12.It was a black triangle with lights on all 3 points and one larger light ball in the middle.  It hovered for about a minute and went south slowly dissapearing in the haze before it returned from the same direction in a slow zig-zag pattern.  Then I witnessed a brilliant flash and explosion sound.  My camera recorded the flash, but it was not aimed at the craft at the time.  Upon reviewing the film the flash was actually three very quick bursts of extremely bright light.It then dissapeared to the south west towards south park and I lost sight again.

731,"Multiple Anomolies In An Ontario TownI was at a local park to do some wind sprints for fitness training.  I had arrived at the park around 20:00hrs and had just begun the workout, doing one sprint, and then while doing the recovery walk back to the starting point, I looked up into the night sky and saw a formation of three objects.  I was facing north, and the objects, numbering three, were flying low, in formation, going from west to east.  These objects were whitish, luminous, but not overly bright.  In fact, if I had not been looking up, it is possible that I may not have noticed them.  The objects were orbish in shape, luminous yet translucent, having a spectral aspect to them, and although the sighting was brief, it caused me to be very alarmed.  The lights did not resemble airplane lights, but had a spectral, unnatural appearance to them.   Alarmed, I walked quickly back to my vehicle and exited the park, as I felt threatened.  They were low and, having read accounts of abduction by ufos, I did no! t wish to be added to the list of abductees.  I was alone in the park, it was very dark, and I felt vulnerable upon seeing these objects.  Also, there was no sound emitted by the objects as they flew overhead.  This encounter left me shaken and anxious.  Early the following morning, before dawn, many dogs in the neighborhood were uncharacteristically barking together.  I was still jittery the following day, and had a very bad night's sleep after this encounter.Although I cannot recall the exact date or time, approximately two or three weeks earlier, my wife and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening, heading northbound on a street in Ingersoll, when we both noticed an unusual object in the night sky. It was approximately 22:00hrs.  The object was an orangish orb, and it was maintaining a steady position approximately 200 feet above a subdivision.  We observed it while driving closer to its position.  I said that we should go into the subdivision so as to get a better look, and when we went into the subdivision, it disappeared from view.  This earlier sighting was approximately one mile north of the second sighting, several weeks later.A few days before this sighting, my oldest son was having a cigarette on the patio before leaving for work in the morning.  It would have been approximately 05:00hrs. While having the smoke, he heard a humming noise in the air above him, although he was unable to see anything that may have been making the noise.  He went inside to tell my wife, but when they went outside together, the humming noise had stopped.As a background, I served four years as an auxiliary police officer and as a part-time jail guard.You are welcome to contact me for any more information that you may require, but please do not publish my name.

The lights were steady throughout the time they were visible and did not blink or flash as a typical aircraft’s lights would.

As we have heavy helicopter traffic, I thought nothing of it until I noticed the driver in the truck in front of me pointing it out to his passenger.  When I got to the airport entrance, I noticed that it was still in the same location but was actually a bit off to the east of the airport.  The car behind me had pulled off to the side of the road and the driver got out to look at it as did the people in the truck two cars in front of me.  I quickly grabbed my iPhone to get some pictures, all the while checking to ensure the object had not moved. I snapped four shots of the object within approximately 500 yard section of Airport Rd and when I looked back after taking them, the object had vanished.  I then pulled over to scan the horizon to see which direction it had gone, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I checked my phone pics to ensure I actually captured the object, but though I had captured the correct area of the sky in which the object was located, there was nothing in any of the photos!  The object was probably about the size of a 737 or a DC-10, roughly cigar shaped with what appeared to be a slight dome above the center of the craft, and no visible wings or tail.  It appeared to be a dull sandy gray color with no other discernible markings.  The fact that it hovered for so long is even more impressive than its sudden disappearance given its apparent size.Because of all the fire bombers and military aircraft heading in and out of the airport, I would normally be inclined to think it was one of ""ours""; however, I know of none of our aircraft (not a Chinook or an Osprey) which can simply vanish in front of one's eyes!",Duration:15 minutes,"Location: Redding, CA",Occurred : 9/16/2016 14:45  (Entered as : 09162016 14:45),Posted: 9/22/2016,Reported: 9/16/2016 4:11:35 PM 16:11,Shape: Cigar

787,"Bluish-green spheres over Cape CodAs a native Cape Codder, I have witness several of these UFOs over the years.  I think that it is important to note that there is a Naval Air Staition on Cape Cod.  If you come to the Cape, after coming over the Sagamore Bridge, there was once a military sight directly off of the first exit, for years the sign in front of a small gate was called “Space Command”. (Yup!) the name has since been changed.  The site has been dubbed “Pave Paws”, and is now said to be a hub for drone command. What it is really used for, truthfully,  I do not know.Growing up on the Cape, there was not much to do.  It is a small suburb of Boston for those adventurous enough to make the hour and a half plus commute in the morning, and it is also a well known summer resort area.  For those of us who lived here outside of the season, which runs from Memorial Day through Labor Day, there is not much to do.  We have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, so that is were we go.  You sit and look at the horizon, you count the waves, you enjoy amazing views, and when the horizon gets boring, you look to the skies.  I can’t tell you how much of my younger days included good friends, a couple of beers, and a day or night at the beach.Most of my high school weekends included at least one bonfire on an empty beach, looking up at the sky.  We used to look for “shooting stars”.   We had a lot of them.  Big, bright, bluish-green balls of light that would regularly, though not often, streak across the sky.It did not take too many seasons of looking to realize that these shooting stars ran in a familiar pattern depending on where on the Cape that you were watching from.in the area of the “upper cape” they tended to run West to East.  If you lived east of “Otis, AFB” they ran West to East. Curious.Fast forward ten or so years, and I was living in my first real home of my own, Cotuit Bay Condos, lying with my wife in bed ,”spooning”, looking out our sliding glass doors towards the north. on a regular basis we watch jets take off from Otis AFB on a West to East trajectory. on this night, circa 1993, we watched a glowing ball of blue-green light “take off” from the same location and travel the same path.  The size of the orb was 2-3 times the size of a fighter jet, and its speed was much faster.  MUCH FASTER!  It got to the point about halfway across the horizon, quickly paused, dropped bit, and then took off almost straight up at an even faster speed and was gone.I have witnessed these balls of light all my life.  Several years after the previous sighting, I was visiting my brother at his house in East Falmouth, MA, I was staying there while recovering from surgery.  I was bed ridden and from my bed I had a view of the sky to the North of the house.  Several times during my stay there I witnessed, mostly at dusk, these orbs flying across the sky in a West to East path.  I casually mentioned them and it was laughed off by most.  One afternoon, the mailman, Phil, (Yes, in small town America we still have them.) came running in the house, yelling about how we wouldn’t believe what he just saw.  We swapped stories, and sure enough, they matched.The last time that I was at my brothers house we sat and watched the sky looking for them but all we saw, seriously, were two Marine-1’s (the President’s helicopter) and a couple Osprey aircraft.(Barack Obama had been vacationing on the Vineyard.)  They ran in a South to North Pattern which intersected the UFO’s regular path.Fast forward to tonight September 15th, 2016, I am living in Hyannis, MA, by the airport.  Out of my bedroom window I can see the take of flight path from Hyannis Airport.  I watch them take off regularly from North to South. I saw the glowing balls, greener this time, but still a bluish green.  They travelled east to west so much faster than the jets that take off. and were only a few hundred yards from the end of the runway, this time, I was looking up at them, not across.  I was able to watch them for only a second or two and they disappeared into the canopy above. the time was 9:55 P.M.",Duration:2 seconds,"Location: Hyannis, MA",Occurred : 9/15/2016 21:55  (Entered as : 09/15/16 21:55),Posted: 9/22/2016,Reported: 9/15/2016 8:24:31 PM 20:24,Shape: Sphere
788,"Comet like craft moving northeast across sky.September 16, 2016.  I am an artist living in Bigfork, Montana.  At approximately 9:45 p.m. on the evening of September 15, 2016, I was out with my dog walking across my parking lot to go into my home.  I happened to look up to admire the night sky and see if the moon was on the rise.  When I did this, there was what I thought to be a firework going straight up into the sky from the Flathead Lake.  It was a large yellow ball with a tail which appeared to be at least 6 times the diameter in length of the object.  Since my dog is afraid of the firework noise, I stood waiting for it to explode when it appeared to stop in midair and began to travel at a consistent speed horizontally on a north east route.  There was absolutely no sound.  I kept walking along the road to make sure to watch it without tree line interference.  It appeared to be headed in the direction of Glacier Park.  I watched until it disappeared from my sight.  With the consistent but slow speed, I calculated I was watching it for approximately 23 seconds.  At no time did the shape or tail change in appearance.When it didn’t explode, I thought it was a comet, but the tail never changed length/shape and the glow remained consistent.  There was absolutely no sound.  By 11:00 p.m., I researched several local news channels in the hopes of finding a newscast about a comet passing over the State of Montana.  I have searched for several more hours throughout the day today trying to see if there were any reports of comet – meteor sightings and have not discovered any reports.Initially I felt initially that is was not a meteor but a comet due the consistent color and tail.  I shared this event with several people I know and one individual recommended that I report it to this organization since now I am convinced it was some sort of UFO due to the behavior and flight.  I have witnessed UFO sightings a couple of times in my life in other states and always have seen objects that are traveling at high rates of speed which I believe were not aircraft.  Before becoming an artist 17 years ago, I worked in the aviation field and am familiar with various aircraft noise and behavior.In summary, I am submitting this as possibly I may not be the only individual who witnessed this event.  As an aside, this is the second event that I have witnessed around the Flathead Lake since moving here 10 years ago.Thank you.",Duration:23 seconds,"Location: Bigfork, MT",Occurred : 9/15/2016 21:45  (Entered as : 09/15/16 21:45),Posted: 9/22/2016,Reported: 9/16/2016 7:35:35 PM 19:35,Shape: Fireball
789,"Huge sphere covered in bright lights just hovers over tree line before slowly descending.I'm driving down Springfields Blvd in Bear, DE, at around 9:30 pm EST on 9/15/16.  The road is long & windy & goes past numerous residential homes & is surrounded by trees.  I'm making a turn when I see an object in the sky, straight ahead of me, in the distance, above the tree lines.  Now, of course, I see planes all the time but this caught my attention because of two things:  It wasn't moving at all & it was circular or spherical in shape.  There is no tail or wings like a regular aircraft.  And it's not flying in any direction.  It's just sitting there, in the air.  But another major thing that caught my eye was how bright it was.  From what I could see, the entire object was covered in bright lights.  Also, the object was far enough away that it was clearly above & beyond the tree line but large enough that I could see the individual lights on the body.  And they were BRIGHT.  I pulled over & was opening the camera app on my phone but when I looked back up it was descending down behind the tree line!  I figured I could catch it around the next bend if I could just get there fast enough but it was nowhere in sight after that.  I even went all the way back to drive that same road again but saw nothing.  About 20-25 minutes later (I made sure to keep a close eye on the clock), there were numerous (actual) planes in the sky. Way more than normal in my opinion.  As if they were searching for something.  About 5-10 after that, I called my brother & mom because I just HAD to tell someone.  I should note that I've seen unidentified bright lights in the sky on that road once before but tonight I actually saw the craft clearly.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Night was illuminated by full moon.  Slight, hazy overcast with very few stars visible.  Sighting was of lights approx a mile out to sea to the SE near the horizon (approx Google map ref 36.621515, -75.856065.  Lights appeared somewhat larger than aircraft lights or stars and shined steadilly, without blinking.  A single red-orange tinged white light would suddenly appear, move steadily and horizontally for approx 5 sec, then suddenly disappear.  After approx 5 min, a similar light would appear, move, then disappear.  After approx 3 such episodes, the appearing light would suddenly flare up to approximately 5 times its original diameter, then suddenly disappear.  When flared, the light was clearly in white, red, and orange horizontal segments.  During the last episode, a smaller-sized light, while moving northward and paralle! l to the horizon, seemed to divide into two equally sized lights, then again into three equal parts, with all three moving apart from each other until they all suddenly and simultanerously disappeared.  About the same time, a large and relatively slow-moving meteor appeared directly overhead, moving sea-ward until it broke up and dissipated.

About 10:40 AM two UH1N helicopters started making wide circles around my neighborhood (dark blue fuselage, white on top) which usually indicates there is a federal VIP in the area for some event.  The helicopters were flying low, about 300 feet altitude.  They circled the neighborhood in 2 mile circles several times.  After the helicopters passed nearly overhead I looked up and saw a large bird circling overhead at about two thousand (2000) feet altitude.  I had seen a similar large bird before a year ago when a couple of UH1N helicopters circled my neighborhood.  The bird did not flap its wings but soared in tight circles for 30 seconds and flew to another location and soared in tight circles for another 30 seconds, and then soared to another location, soared in tight circles for another 30 seconds.  I estimate the bird had a wingspread of 10 feet.  The bird appeared to be alternately black and silver.

850,"Baseball-sized Orange Orb WitnessedWife and I walked outdoors to our patio on the northwest side of our new country home at approximately 3:15 AM ET in Gardner, MA.  We're new to the neighborhood, so we are diligent about opening and closing the door silently as not to disturb the neighbors who often have their windows open during the warm summer months.Being a sound engineer, I immediately noticed a deafening quiet that was unmistakable to me.  No crickets, no wind, no cars, nothing. I whispered ""Wow, it's really quiet out here. A little too quiet"". My wife said nothing.It was dark enough so that you could not see the sky behind the trees. I realized we had a huge moon the night before, so the 'no moon' darkness had struck me as weird. Elapsed time we were outside was about 2-3 minutes.  We were both facing west toward our neighbors house when we both saw a single spherical light appear, with no dynamics in luminosity. Nothing at first, then right to full-on brightness.The singular amber / orange glow was the same exact color as the street lamp but much brighter, and the shape was spherical instead of oval, about the size of a baseball or softball.  The street lamp seemed to be about 10+ feet directly behind the object we saw.  The object kept an altitude approximately 5 feet below the street lamp from our perspective.The glowing sphere never stopped moving at any point since it appeared. It moved at about the speed of a house fly, in a perfect counter-clockwise circle, with a slightly accelerated figure 8 pattern every few revolutions.  The object moved in a circle pattern that was about 2 feet in diameter.  It left a trail of light behind itself in the same color that faded linearly, but was overrun by the sphere again before the light trail fully dissipated.I whispered, ""Do you see that?"". Standing slightly in front of me, my wife leaned toward my viewpoint on the patio and said, ""Yea, what is that?"".  It seemed that once this object felt us notice it's presence, it disappeared with no fade, instant off and gone.  The object was gone even before I could open my Camera app.I noticed some trees between the object we saw and our patio. So I waited until daylight this morning to see if it could have been street lamp light refracting off of a bunch of shiny leaves, but there are barely any leaves to obstruct the view apparently.  We never saw anything block the perspective of the object while it appeared and danced for approximately 15-20 seconds in total.After it disappeared, I came to my senses and opened my Camera app. I was surprised to see a Camera flash to our far right from across the street.  I was sure the neighbors saw the object too and were taking a photo, while forgetting to disable the camera flash.  When I looked over, I saw another 5000k temp flash in the gloss of the neighbors car, but no light hit the street or tree next to where the source would be.  Neighbors were asleep with all lights off an nobody was outside at all.No activity so far yet tonight.

871,"Cylindrical-shaped object emitting flashing lights near South Fairfax Avenue.While on vacation in Los Angeles, I was in the front passenger seat as we were driving in the area of South Fairfax Avenue and Venice Boulevard, heading toward Cadillac Avenue, around 2:00 PM on September 11, 2016, when I spotted a cylindrical-shaped object emitting two gold-colored flashing lights in a vertical configuration.  The lights flashed intermittently and independently, and the object itself seemed to be just hanging in the clear blue sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I managed to take a few pictures with my Canon PowerShot SX20 IS camera, and then lost sight of it as we turned a corner. I am not sure what direction the object was in.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport,Thank you for your message, and I did submit a detailed report to NUFORC yesterday. If you're unable to find it, I can resubmit it.To summarize, I spotted this while riding as a passenger in a car with two other witnesses, and the sighting lasted about 5 minutes.  I think we were on or near Venice Boulevard when I saw it, then I lost sight of it as we turned a corner.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon, and there was no sound.  Two gold-colored flashing lights emitted from it intermittently and independently from each other.  One light was near the top of the object, and the other light was near its bottom. It if weren't for these lights I would probably not have noticed it.  The object was stationary.Regards,((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Los Angeles, CA",Occurred : 9/11/2016 14:00  (Entered as : 09/11/16 14:00),Posted: 9/22/2016,Reported: 9/21/2016 3:30:29 PM 15:30,Shape: Cylinder

For some reason I looked out the window, I was on the second floor, and started noticing strange lights on my neighbors’ property.  At first I thought it was a vehicle shining lights on the trees or the barn, but longer I looked the more I realized it wasn’t a vehicle.I could never really see the source of the lights as there is a tree line between our properties, but they were in multiple places in their pasture and beyond to the woods behind their property.  I could catch a glimpse of some sort of white light moving about.   They must have been staying close to the ground because they kept up- lighting the trees.The lights turned on and off, sometimes fading out, sometimes shutting off like someone threw a switch.  They moved around, they made no sound.  One thing I did notice was right above that area was some small lightning bolts every now and then. There was no thunder. When I looked up all I saw were stars.  We did have storms come through although not until after sunrise. I watched the lights for more than 3 hours.  I was moving from window to window trying to figure it out.  I woke my husband up to look at them.  He did see them and went back to bed.  I was too worried to go back to sleep and too afraid to wander onto their property alone to try to get a better look.I went up to check with the neighbors (after sunrise) and they heard and saw nothing.  They were in bed.After I thought about it, I believe I saw those lights once before.  I wrote it off as the neighbor being out on his tractor late at night.

This light appeared to be hovering over the Penokee Mountain range, near the same vicinity as the famous 1975 Baker Family UFO report.  This light which I was very skeptical of, appeared white, and occasionally rotated itself to have an amber glow.  This light would move left, right, up and down but never too far away from where we originally spotted it.  We could hear the hum of a jet airliner in the distance, we soon seen the airliner approach way up in the sky, watched its lights to compare. No similarity as one might expect.  Finally I was a little bored and annoyed by the light because I had no binoculars, scopes or anything to get a closer look.  At 4:45AM exactly, fog started to roll in over the mountain range.  With this fog, we could see beams of lights coming from the craft.  It was at this time I was certain we were watching a UFO.  At 5AM, suddenly it moved upwards about 300 feet, moved left, and darted straight East and up until we could no longer see it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was due East of our location. It was an orange or amber light moving from south to north.  If i held my fists out with my arms straight, it was about two fists, maybe two and a half fists above the horizon.  And the distance seemed to be perhaps over downtown Topeka, or maybe between downtown and the hospitals to the west of downtown.  From this I would guess the altitude of the light to be maybe 1,000 feet.If i stand facing east, the light moved to my 10:30 or 11:00 position. As it traveled it turned from orange to white to red and then disappeared. I could see no other lights. If it was some aircraft then it only had this one light on it. I could not hear any sound such as motors as if it were a helicopter. Helicopters landing at the hospitals are very audible and there is no mistaking them and their various lights. This was not a helicopter.My friend saw the same thing, once I pointed it out to him.  He went and got binoculars out of his car as the first light went out of sight.

First, the reliability of the witnesses are beyond reproach.  Second, the photographic evidence shows a very strange object, and if one looks carefully, two of the photos appear to show the silhouette of at least one occupant, possibly two.Statements by witnesses are forthcoming.Report of Sighting:  On Saturday, September 10, 2016, Pepe (fictitious name), wife, 22 yoa daughter, and 15 yoa son were in the process of exiting their house to enter their vehicle.  Son alerted Pepe about a bright light hovering above near the zenith.  Pepe saw the light and remarked it was not only too high over the horizon to be the planet Venus, but also brighter.  The object was stationary and to Pepe’s eyes it seemed to consist of two lights in one.  Pepe asked wife to bring camera from the house and asked her to take a photo of the light.  Wife took the first photo.  Camera is an old Sony digital camera, model DSC-HX200V, with an integrated zoom lens made by Carl Zeiss.  Wife handed over the camera to Pepe. Pepe took a photo.  He waited a few minutes and when he tried to take another photo could not locate the object in the LCD screen.  His son advised the object was still in the same place and after re-acquiring the object he took another photo.  Pepe advised the three photos had different zoom settings.After approximately 7-10 minutes a large cloud hid the object.  After realizing it would take a long time for the cloud to pass they decided to enter vehicle and departed area.  From time to time Pepe pulled over the vehicle in order to try to locate object, but the cloud was still hiding the object.  When the cloud finally moved away the object was gone.Pepe regrets he did not try to take more photos of the object at different zoom settings.  He thought at the time the object lacked any features and was not doing anything.  His overall impression of the experience is that whoever controlled this object wanted for him not just to see it, but to take photos of it.Date of Sighting: 10 Sep16  Geographical Location of Sighting:  San Juan, Puerto Rico Description of Area/ Surroundings:  Urban  Time of Sighting:  Shortly after 6:20 P.M.Weather Conditions: Clear Circumstances for Becoming Aware of Object: Son alerted his father (Pepe) Number of Objects:  One Apparent Size of Object at Arm’s Length (Subtended Angle): Similar to planet Venus Approximate Angle of Object from Horizon:  Approximately 80 deg.; Cardinal Orientation if Other Than Zenith (right above head):  West Estimated Distance to Object:  Several thousand feet Estimated Altitude of Object from Ground:  Several thousand feet Color of Object: White light.

Results of same will be released at a later date.Authentication of Photos:  Principal investigator have personally known Pepe and his family for many years and he can, absolutely and categorically, vouch for the reputation and trustworthiness of witnesses.Evaluation of Photographic Evidence by Principal Investigator: Maximum optical zoom: 30X Maximum combined optical and digital zoom: 120X EXIF data recorded by the camera for the Focal Length is regrettably incorrect. The camera records all photos as 144 mm of focal length. Pepe advised his camera is old and meant for amateur photography. He has a friend who owns the same model camera and it also records all photos as 144 mm.Photo #1:  Photo taken by wife.  EXIF data shows a Digital Zoom Ratio (DZR) of 3X, meaning the camera magnified the optical zoom by three times, for a total zoom setting of 90X.  Wife advised she used a zoom setting a bit lower than the maximum allowed by the camera.

On the left side of the object one can appreciate at least three well delineated horizontal dark lines. Unable to determine whether these lines are painted or they are part of the infrastructure of the object.Photo #2: Photo taken by Pepe. DZR = 4X.  This is indeed the maximum zoom capability of the camera, providing a combined optical and digital zoom of 120X.  Pepe advised he used the maximum zoom setting.  One can observe two large semicircular apertures, or cavities, or windows in the underside of the object.  The inside of these two apertures are bathed with a very intense white light.  Of particular interest is the aperture at the 4 o’clock position, which appears to show two opaque figures silhouetted against the bright background.  The figure on the right side appears very humanoid in shape and slightly leaning to the left.  Some parallel dark lines are visible at the edges of the dark thick band.Photo #3:  Photo taken by Pepe.  DZR = 1.25X.  The combined optical and digital zoom was 37.50X.  Pepe advised he used just a bit of the digital zoom. In the third photo there is no light coming from the inside of the object, thereby revealing many features.  This is consistent with Pepe’s statement that he had a hard time trying to reacquire the object in the LCD screen of his camera.  This photo gives the impression the object rotated approximately 180° along its vertical axis.  (Bear in mind the object is not in the zenith (directly above), even though the photos give the impression Pepe was directly under the object.  The three photos were taken with the camera always facing the object from the same angle, meaning towards the West.)  The aperture with the two figures previously located at the 4 o’clock position now seems located at the 11 o’clock position.  The apparent humanoid figure that was leaning to the left in photo #2 is now more clearly visible through it.  What is more, this figure seems to be resting its arms on the border of the semicircular aperture.  To the right of this figure there appears to be another humanoid figure.  In photo #3 one can clearly see the closely-spaced dark lines are not painted, but are ridges or striations running parallel and towards the center of the object.",Duration:7-10 minutes,"Location: San Juan (Puerto Rico), ",Occurred : 9/10/2016 18:20  (Entered as : 09/10/16 18:20),Posted: 10/11/2016,Reported: 9/30/2016 5:16:44 PM 17:16,Shape: Other
895,"Fast moving, bright shimmering rectangular object near Elma WA in daylightOn 9-10-16, apx. 12-1210pm, while on my daily walk, I saw a large, shimmering, fast moving, rectangular shaped object for 3 to 5 seconds.The sky was clear blue, cloudless, windless, sun up and shining. I was near Utility Lane, Elma, Washington, walking eastwards.  Elevation is about 300 ft.  The object appeared to head from Northerly direction east of ELMA to a Southerly direction towards Oakville, over the tops of hills that are about 500 ft in elevation.  After about 3 seconds, it turned to a black color, and dropped in altitude, and became obscured by a closer hill. Never saw object again.  Did not hear any sound.Unable to determine distance and size of object from my vantage point.Speed was significantly faster than a standard prop plane. Also, there were no noticeable aircraft flying even though there is a small airport nearby, and this is in a flight path for military aircraft as well as SEA-TAC International airport. I've seen many planes, ultralights and helicopters on a near daily basis in the area, over many years, and this was not one of them. The only reason for this report is the extremely bright shimmering, approaching a welding arc color in brightness. Difficult to look at. Even aluminum skinned planes aren't this bright!  As a side note, I mentioned this to a friend in Oakville, WA. She was on the phone to a friend in California when she heard a sudden thundering sound that somewhat echoed, and was gone as fast as it started. She heard this about the same time as I witnessed the object in question, from my location about 15 miles away.

898,"Three lights with one being green, if connected, one can form a triangle; also stood in place while the lights flashed in a pattern.Friend noticed something odd in the night sky at around 1:50am east of our position. It appeared to be right over Vail, AZ, or our suburb of Rita Ranch.  It was rather odd, when we noticed these three lights, that could form a triangle.  The three lights began to move our direction without breaking formation, and then halted in one spot. It did not move from the position, but instead seemed to blink their lights and stare at us.  I can only assume that they knew of us and watched with caution.  The interesting thing about these lights were that they seem to be blinking in a pattern of sorts, and the left light happened to be the color green, but the other two lights were typical bright star-like lights (although far brighter and clearly closer).  There is no full moon out, nor was it a new moon; the moon was not in my view when looking east toward these lights. The strangest thing was the coyotes were noisy, far nosier than usual.  Typically you may hear a few coyo! tes yipper and howl, but only once in a blue moon (pun intended); this time every coyote was at it.  I thought it may be a party down the wash since it was Fri/Sat, but it was rather late.  Anyways, my friend an I viewed this mystery for a few moments and normally I'm able to point out whether or not it was a plane or helicopter, of course three lights flashing in a strange pattern is a little odd.  The left green light was curious as you never really hear about colored lights unless it pairs with other colors (notably red, because then its a human craft).  The lack of sound didn't help, nor the stationary position it developed.  I wasn't going to wait around any much longer and told my friend to step outside and make sure I enter my house safely (I live across the street in the direction of the mystery), yeah, I was spooked and it was still there when I had entered.

So i kept looking and I told my girlfriend to look at it to swearing that I had just seen it appear.  We both started looking at the star for about 3 or 4 minutes when the star just disappeared.  We kept looking at the spot where the star was until it re appeared again. it appeared and disappeared every 3 or 4 minutes for about 15 minutes staying in the same spot the entire time.  Then, as I was looking at it bright again for a few minutes. I was looking at it and all of a sudden it flashed brightly three times, to then dim away to more of a dim orange light and immediately started moving south, hovering all over jasper slowly and appeared to be loosing altitude but was traveling a straight line, getting so close and so low that I could almost make a shape. it disappeared almost directly over our car.  For about five minutes, I kept looking to see if it would re appear right where in was, almost directly over our car on the East side of town.  All of sudden a loud bang came from out of the trunk area on our car like something landing or hitting.  And then we turned to each other asking if had both heard the noise, we thought maybe it was an animal but our trunk was facing the water and the noise was far to loud for it to be a small animal. then we heard more noises coming from out trunk, so I jumped in the drivers seat to leave.

Was ~3 feet from windshield.9/10/2016 UFO Sighting ~1:00 a.m. in Bluffton and Hilton Head, SC.Two friends picked me up at the airport in Savannah and as we were traveling north on the Bluffton Parkway toward Hilton Head, we all saw a meteorite, or shooting star, go low across the night sky.  We all laughed and said, “Good luck, make a wish.”  A little bit later, we had turned into the Moss Creek community and were about a quarter of a mile down the fairway talking and laughing, when a ball of light came from the right, zoomed across the windshield and then disappeared to the left off into a grove of trees.Two of us saw it and said, “What was that!?”  At first, I thought it might be a weird huge bird, but thinking about it a minute later, I realized it seemed completely round, about 6” to 8” in diameter.  It was really bright white in the middle as though it was glowing from within and it moved very fast without any wings.  There was no sound either (although we did have the windows up in the car).  It looked like it zoomed over the hood of the car, about 3 feet from the windshield.  It went from right to left and then swooped off into the distance, making an ""s""-curve across what I later found out was a clearing in the golf course.  From there, it flew into a grove of tall trees on the left side of the clearing.We immediately turned the car around and drove back about 20 feet to the clearing and trees to see if we could still see it.  I did see two dim lights, one brighter than the other, in the trees about 8 ft from the ground.  However, these may have been lights from houses behind the trees, but until we look at that area again, I don’t know that for sure.  I’ve been told that’s all golf course and there are no houses there.Later, we wondered if the “shooting star” and the “ball of light” were connected.  Maybe, maybe not, either way this was an exciting start to my vacation and I don’t know how to explain it, so I believe it was truly a UFO.A little history on me: I have investigated light anomalies in the past, including the Marfa lights and the Brown Mountain lights.

My mom then said 'it's not a plane but we can't figure out what it is'.I went outside and it was hard to see although it did sparkle and seem to reflect either the sun or had it's own light source.  We grabbed the binoculars.  Looking through the binoculars I could see that it at sometimes looked just white, and at others it was like an orange fire ball.  It wasn't moving quickly at all - seemingly staying in one spot for quite a while.  My mom then noticed that there were two more!  I was wondering if they were drones, skydivers, or something like that.  At one point they looked like they were triangular in shape and a ball at others.  They seemed also to be in a triangle formation- but since they were hard to see all the time we don't know if that was a pattern or not.I shot some footage with my dad's iphone- poor quality but you can see it on the iphone if someone knows how to 'zoom in' after the fact.  We weren't sure how long they would be in the sky so although we wanted to look at it through a telescope we didn't want to take our eyes off it it for too long in order to track one down.In hindsight we should have called the news!

As a plane passed overhead and out of my line of sight, I noticed a round, pulsating light in the distance.  It was backed by significant dark cloud cover, but didn’t seem to be moving.  I was able to watch it for about 2-3 minutes before it became obscured by trees. I rode on approaching the west side of the I-35 overpass, and came to a high, open spot giving me the opportunity to see the ball of pulsating light again. It hadn’t moved, changed size, or direction in the 3-5 minutes since I had seen it last.  I was able to watch for another minute or two, noticing again the pulsation as well as a lack of any discernable movement.  I decided to pull over and try to record it using my phone.  I made the first possible right immediately after the I-35W overpass.  This gave me a high vantage point with no obstructions or interference of visual contact with the object.  I briefly looked away to get my phone out, entered my code to unlock it, and selected the video option under the camera mode.  This whole process took less than 20 seconds.

922,"Hovering lights spotted over FIFE, WAI would like to begin that I am a former member of the us navy and have a very good eye for aircraft.  Being in the seattle area I am able to identify every aircraft day or night by its light patterns. tonight I was in my work parking lot near the auburn park and ride.  My attention was first brought to a craft which lights were similar to but not consistent with any craft I have seen hovering over the sky about in the airspace of fife, WA.  After just a few moments of watching the solid red, blue, and white lights I noticed there were too many white lights and suddenly the red and white lights were eminating its source outward toward the sky around it.  They were red and white lights almost pulsating and changing direction much like a a police car pulling over a car.  Now I first tried to see whether it was in fact airborne as I live in the valley.  I was hoping that perhaps it was high on a hill, however it was not. After about 5 mins of watching these pulsating lights (which as a result looked as though the craft was elongated or disk shaped) its colors changed to solid white and blinking red like an FAA approved aircraft. It began to move north west in the directing of the olympic pennisula rather that the sea tac airport as I would expect such an aircraft to do. Ill be honest in all of my days observing aircraft day, night, shipboard, on land, and at sea I was frightened and concerned for the aircraft I could see preparing to land at sea tac. It maintained the same altitude while it moved from its hovering position with a slight decent maybe 1 or two degrees which is consistent with a craft going further from view. It was dark, but I have never seen an aircraft emminate that many lights so irradically. I hope that you people can maybe try and find a logical explination for this. Yes I know it was dark, yes there is airtraffic for both lewis/mcchord and seatac however this wasnt any aircraft light pattern I have ever seen.

944,"Perfect circle saucer with massive green, red, and blue lights flies right over my head on sleepy road at night.I was driving on 684 South and immediately upon passing White Plains Airport, after realizing it was a beautiful clear night, I decided to look up into the sky.  After seeing 2 sets of planes that were very close to each other and not making anything of it I saw another object just a little bit above and to the right of the right two planes that were in my field of view.  Staring at this object for the first 10 seconds I didn't think much of it other than that it looked like a plane on it's side.  It was the exact shape of a cross and at the ends of the vertical line which was longer than the horizontal line intersecting right above the middle point, there were two abnormally bright red lights at each end.  On the horizontal line there were smaller white lights on each end.  This very clearly formed a cross shape to any observer who had the same point of view.  My first guess was that it was someone flying a private plane on it's side and was therefore waitin! g for it to eventually turn into the traditional horizontal form that a plane displays. I decided to speed up on the road since this object was just sitting in the sky and looked a little bit bigger than the average size of a visible plane.  Upon making a left turn towards Purchase the object started to move and dropped down rather quickly diagonally to the left and very clearly was heading in the same direction that I was about to.  After making my left turn I sped up and tried to keep up with this light, never once losing sight of it, still having the cross shape and red and white lights.  I realized now that this was definitely very odd and bigger than I would have guessed.  Still, never in my life would I have guessed that I was about to see what I did in about 1- 2 minutes.   As the object started to be buried by the upper foliage of the trees on the right of my road I watched it's light pattern glowing and dipping down suddenly to the right.  At this point I said scre! w it, I'm not going to Purchase, this is weird, I'm going to s! ee what the hell this is if I can.  I sped up as fast as I reasonably could and made the first right that came about on this road.  Finding a right turn I immediately jumped into it and started to slow down so that I could keep track of this glowing light that was still piercing and poking through the foliage of the forest like area of Harrison.  At this point I was driving about 5-10 miles per hour so I could gage where the object was going since I was so worried I was going to overshoot it and miss it forever.  About 10-15 seconds onto this road a car pulled in and I started to have to drive faster since it was tailgating me.  Driving fast and starting to shake a little bit, all the while constantly ducking under the windshield of my car and looking out the left side I kept track of this mysterious light.  Finally after about 15-20 seconds the car behind me made a left turn and I was able to slow back down.  Almost immediately within seconds, on my left the glowing light was seen ! to pierce through the trees and foliage and to my amazement I had a realization that I was going to see whatever this thing was.  Instantly the light got bigger and very red, white and a little bit of yellow, and all of a sudden, so big and boom....right over the trees on my left side...for a solid 2 seconds I saw a massive perfect circular disk with 8-10 massive crystal clear, blue, green, and red circular lights encased within the the circumference of the underside which now covered up about 75 percent of my field of view.  Shaking beyond belief, with my jaw dropped, I had not a single thought other than that I saw a perfect flying saucer fly right over my head as clear as day.  The lights were absolutely huge and the hood of my car and nearby area of the road and trees were lit up in glowing rainbow like colors.  As it passed over me and over the trees on my right I drove faster while simultaneously looking backwards and watched it clear the trees and spin out behind it ! and to the right in a circular motion.  I sped up in my car, r! ealizing this could have been the dumbest thing I've ever done and made the first left turn I found.  While turning around in the cul de sac I immediately grabbed my phone and called my friend and told them to go outside and see if they could see anything, as I was freaking out more than I could ever have imagined in my life.  Darting back up the road I watched the light pass through the foliage on my left side and start to disappear.  Upon getting back to the main road where I initially made the off course decision to chase this thing down, I lost all sight of it for good.  I never once expected to ever see that, and had I known that I would have seen a saucer over my head with perfectly clear colored circular lights in a circle underneath it, I never would have tried to follow it.   I would also like to note that this object made absolutely no sound.  This is singlehandedly the strangest thing that has ever happened to me and I hope it never happens again.  Haven't been able to sl! eep the past 4 nights.  Hope to hear that someone else caught sight of this so that I may have any validity here. If only I had another witness.  Truly horrifying.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The bright light lasted for about  30 seconds, then completely shut off.  The following day it felt as though I had severe sunburn  to my skin and my eyes were painful from what I had experienced.  There was nothing remotely  possible of duplicating this light on either my house or my neighbor's house.

It did not seem to be one solid shape but rather a reflection of part of a shape. The floating green light sped downwards in the sky as soon as it appeared.

979,"Perfect triangle craft with green-steady/yellow-steady/red flashing lights flying LOW and SLOW on Labor Day.My son and I had just gone to bed.  As we were getting ready to sleep, we heard a loud noise coming over the hill.  We live in the desert on the edge of the military air space for Nellis Air Force out of Vegas, so we get a lot of jets flying over head.  When they do fly over they are gone before you ever hear them; so unless there is more than one you never see the jet that you just heard.  That night as we lay in bed we could hear a loud engine noise coming towards us from over the mountain to the south.  I sat up to look out the east facing window above my bed as a perfect triangle craft came into view.  It was slightly banked (bottom facing us) heading N/NW.  It was small and if not for the direction it was going you couldn't tell which was the front.  The ends each had a light, front/green, two back/yellow, top w/ antenna/flashing red.  We could see the top just enough to see the light and antenna until it went out of sight.  The craft could be heard for only briefly once it was out of view.The noise was not a regular sounding engine. It was more smooth and was like a loud humming. We could hear it for about 5 sec. before it was visible.  It moved rather slowly.  It was visible for about 10 seconds after it came over the south hill and before it passed over the north hill (approx. 300ft.).I am a 45 year old educated (13+years of schooling) stay at home mom, and my son is 11.   We see all kinds of lights but rarely are they close enough to see what kind craft they are on.  This triangle was only about 200ft above the ground (very low, barley above the mountains of our canyon).  There was not enough light to see a color, but it was low and slow.  I have seen pictures of other triangle crafts, but they are bigger than this, and usually have a light in the middle, this diid not and was small in comparison.I would love to speak to you about all I've seen and this event, but you'll have to leave a message as my phone does not work in the canyon I live in.

987,"White and Orange lights that seemed to be intelligent/intelligently controlled followed us all night.The evening of September 5, my cousin and I once again found ourselves in the general vicinity of an incident from the previous morning.  We were about 3 miles upstream from the previous morning, at a small swimming hole along Piney Fork Rd in South Park Township, PA.  Just after dark we noticed what looked like flashlights descending the hill on the opposite shore of the small third-order stream.  The hill is particularly steep and would not be anyone’s chosen route to the bottom of the hill, especially since there’s a bike trail atop the hill with a trailhead within sight from there.  It became weird once we couldn’t see any of the people who would be carrying the lights, nor did we hear anything or anyone walking down the forested slope.  I remember seeing four different lights, which somewhat resembled incandescent flashlights, only as they seemed to get closer there were no flashlight beams shining through any of the trees.  These lights appeared to only ill! uminate a very localized area of leaves in front of them.  Also, as they grew closer, one would be near the top of the hill again, their beam also unnaturally contained.  My cousin and I got a little freaked out and  walked to the road near my truck, only about fifty yards away through a small patch of riparian forest. We gathered our thoughts and decided to head back down to the creekside.   “After all,” we said, “who cares who those people are, we aren’t on private property.” As we approached the creek it looked as though the “people” had finally reached the bottom of the hill near the water. My cousin had grabbed my 12-volt spotlight and a portable power pack from the truck and he shined all 20-million candlepower toward them, trying to see who they were and also as a type of passive intimidation tactic since we had no idea of the visitors’ intentions. After all, they had just chosen the most difficult way possible down the hill, which no s ane person would do in any normal c! ase.  We got to the streambank and stood on the small beach.  There was nobody there.  After seeing the lights only moments before near the creek, nothing, nobody in sight. We were now even more freaked out. It felt as though they were hiding under cloak of darkness stalking us or something. Thinking we may be at the mercy of a team of psychopaths or something, we stood there quiet and in total darkness, no flashlights, just listening. As we stood there a township police car drove up to where I had parked, stopped and shined their spotlight on the vehicle and into the woods toward us. They wouldn’t have been able to see us if they wanted to anyway because of where we were at. The light went out and it appeared as though the police cruiser had parked and shut off their headlights. We assumed they were coming over to investigate or something. So a sense of both relief and irritation set in, because we now thought that maybe the lights were other police officers instead of killers. We also were kinda pissed because we were about to be harassed by so! me bored rural policemen for no reason…. But then I saw the police car cross the small bridge right upstream of our location and continue up the road. It was puzzling. We assumed there must have been two cars or something originally but one had left…. So we stood there, making sure to talk so they’d know where we were and that we weren’t a threat. But no flashlights, no footsteps in the woods. Suddenly the whole energy changed around us, and a very unsettling feeling overcame me. Mike also conveyed his feeling of unease. We stood there, and I heard maybe two very small sticks crack in the woods. There was also a beam of orangeish light shining down the streambank from the road up near the bridge, as if someone was looking for someone or something. But we hadn’t seen anyone leave the woods and it had been a long enough time since seeing the police car that the cops would have made their presence known, even if they had tried sneaking up on us. At precisely that moment, we sa! id screw this and gathered our stuff so we could dip outta the! re as fa st as possible. Still thinking that we were now surrounded by possible killers or freaks we walked to the road with the spotlight on full blast just in case someone had tried hiding, planning to pounce on us. But nobody was around. Just us. We put our things in the back of the Blazer, shined the spotlight around quickly, and were getting in the truck when the same lights appeared in the woods right where they had originally been. Only there was also a very bright yellow ball of light over there as well, in the treetops. Then one more, an orange-lighted craft or orb, whatever it was flew across the road clearing about a quarter mile in front of us and probably no more than 200 feet off the ground.. We were frantic. We high-tailed it outta there as fast as we could! After leaving we drove up the road and stopped in a random neighborhood cul-de-sac off of Connor Rd. What appeared to be a formation of some type was to the left of the very bright half-crescent moon. It was comprised of singular, small lights but covered a very large area of the sky, not across but upward. The lights appeared as though they were stars, only they were red. I think they may have been trying to camouflage themselves in the sky amongst some real stars because not all of them were odd, just a handful. We sat there and caught our breath. Right before we were about to drive away my cousin pointed out a small white light in a tree near someone’s house. I didn’t see it as anything more than a high-mounted exterior light. So we didn’t really give it too much more thought. It may or may not have been an orb, who knows...We ended up stopping in Finleyville for cigarettes, then drove toward home. As we passed an old chapel/cemetery, Mike had a sudden urge to stop there ! for some reason. It’s weird because I had thought of it while still in Finleyville but didn’t say anything. The place we stopped is called “James Chapel and Cemetery”, and is located at one of the highest points for miles looking north. The top of Pittsburgh’s UPMC building is even visible. That’s a pretty far view for this area due to the topography. Anyway, we ended up sitting in the cemetery behind the church under the moonlight. The atmosphere was actually very comforting  and serene, a welcome contrast to what we had been experiencing ever since leaving Piney Fork. Just being there felt safe and mellow. We ended up sitting in that old cemetary for a couple of hours. The vibes were good there, a peaceful oasis in the center of pure madness. It seemed as though the church had some type of repellant effect on them. We were still able to see many orb-like lights in the sky, but many more were either in the semi-distant treetops, along the power lines, and especially in the! area where we had come from. We were able to clearly see acro! ss the P iney Fork and Peters Creek Valleys from there. The amount of unexplained lights in that valley was astonishing. They were either white, orange, or yellowish in color. While sitting there I witnessed one of the orange lights split into two separate orange lights in the treetops. There were also some that would pulsate, becoming very bright for awhile, then dim, and sometimes even not visible, as if their lights faded out how a bad wire connection would fade out. They all did their things  for varying amounts of time. The oddest part of our experience near this chapel and in the cemetery was how the orbs that had been moving seemingly became “frozen” in place or something. None of them came anywhere remotely close to us or even moved at all for that matter. Only pulsating, vanishing, or splitting as the one did.Once we left we took a different way home. We ended up seeing some nice things someone had left out for the trash, possibly a cleanout or something. So we stopped to look through it. This was about three miles from the chapel, at the intersection of Scheinbach Rd. and Bedell Rd. in Jefferson Hills, PA. In being a very rural area, it is very uncommon for people to leave stuff by the side of the road like that. After looking through the many things that were there, probably 10 minutes after arrival, the unmistakeable sound of the jet engine suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Exactly the sound we had heard coming from the light over the pond the previous morning. Although very quiet, the engine’s sound just filled the whole valley. We were out in the sticks after all. I couldn’t find the source, looking all around, sky, woods, fields….. But he spotted the source. I asked “where is it?” Mike replied “you don’t even wanna know. Like really, dude. You don’t… Do you?” Of course I sa! id “yes, where is it?!!” He walked me over about 10 feet and pointed. “Right there”, he said. Much to my surprise it was closer than I even imagined it would come. It was a white light, very white, hovering within the woods, behind the branches of a silver maple tree directly across the road, no more than 50-75 feet away. Needless to say we dipped outta there quick! We ended up going home and didn’t see anything else that night.",Duration:6 hours,"Location: South Park Township, PA",Occurred : 9/5/2016 20:00  (Entered as : 09/05/16 20:00),Posted: 9/30/2016,Reported: 9/24/2016 7:23:45 PM 19:23,Shape: Light

994,"Bright white orbs in the trees, atop a hill,and partially silent yellowish orb with quieter jet-like sound.My cousin and I went fishing at a local pond in Jefferson Hills, PA. The Iron Bridge Ponds was the spot, tucked in a valley along Peters Creek Rd. near PA 43.	We arrived at the spot and my cousin Mike pointed out what he claimed to be “imposter stars” in the sky.  They were in the area near Orion’s Belt.  They flashed in many different colors, mostly greens at this particular sighting.  We walked back to the ponds, which sit in between the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad line and the steep embankment carrying PA 43.  Once we arrived near the water I noticed a white light atop the hill above said embankment, on the opposite side of the highway.  At first glance it looked like a street light, but upon further examination I realized that it was not behind the trees, but rather within them. It was a bright white, similar to the color of a 6000K LED. As it hovered in the trees he pointed out a second light that appeared suddenly in the canopy of a small patch of woods  along the opposite shore of the pond, roughly 100 yards away from us. Also white, this light was very dim in comparison to the one atop the hill, which had now moved down to t! he crest of the highway embankment. The embankment is probably 100 feet high and treeless. The light appeared to be an orb or orb-like, much smaller than any aircraft I’ve encountered. This was also the case with the second, dimly lit light.Atop the embankment, the first orb hovered silently for about 5 minutes before vanishing. Almost instantly it appeared in a different location about 200 yards north and roughly 150 feet in the sky over the highway.  Shortly after, the dimly lit one in the woods below vanished, as if it just fizzled out or faded away.  Eventually the original light made its way higher and eventually left the area after it reached a fairly high level off the ground.As the twilight approached we stood along the shore opposite of where we were when we witnessed the phenomena, but in the same general location.  Heavy fogs would roll in and dissipate in very short periods and the cirrus clouds above were illuminated by the sun in a unique shade of pink.  Shortly thereafter, just before the sun was about to peek over the horizon, another larger light, similar in color to a traditional incandescent light rose out of the valley about ½ a mile in front of us and advanced toward us over the treeline along the railroad tracks, which were about 75-100 yards away.  It flew straight toward us silently, still ascending slowly. It flew over the pond and made a quick southward turn in front of us, probably only 200-300 feet above the water.  As it turned, the sound of what I can only explain as a very quiet jet turbine, so quiet that most people wouldn’t even notice on a normal day It continued south, before ascending into the wispy layer of cirrus clouds! , then disappeared  into the distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

996,"Intense, pulsating, humming sound heard in Greenbelt Park around 3AM, Labor Day morning.While camping in Loop D of Greenbelt Park, I was awakened by what was the sound of animals walking in the woods surrounding our campsite.  At the time, there were no generators on nearby, no traffic sounds coming from the nearby roadways, and no airplane or helicopter sounds--just the sounds of insects and the continuing sounds of what were probably just animals moving in the woods.While laying awake, though, unable to fall back asleep, an unnatural, pulsating, humming sound grew from among the natural sounds I was hearing.  The sound grew louder and louder, sounding like it was approaching the area in which we were.  It reached such an immensely loud volume that I couldn't believe my wife hadn't awoken.  The overwhelming sound continued at this discomforting volume for what I believe was several minutes.Honestly, I was scared.  I continued laying there in our tent, only looking out the tent's mesh portions we left uncovered for the night breezes and not leaving the tent to actually take a look up or around.  I didn't see anything from inside the tent, but the sound was haunting.  Thankfully, as I thought at the time, the sound receded back into the the more natural sounds of the night, sounding like it had traveled away from the area, and finally leaving me in peace, but unable to fall back asleep for some time.During the entire experience, I had attempted to wake my wife up without being too loud because I didn't want to sound ridiculous.  The following morning, though, she told me she had heard me, but just went back to sleep.  She assured me, however, that she had heard some sort of sound like what I described to her, but in her sleepy state just figured it was a natural, insect-like sort of buzzing.  I've since assured her that it was not. It was nothing I've heard before, nothing natural, nothing heard any other night during our stay at Greenbelt Park.I reached out to Greenbelt Park via email after returning home from our long drive, as well as to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center via Twitter.

They even move up and down but stay at a close proximity of where they initially begin to hover. They have been doing this that we know of at least a couple a week's ago, but could be longer. We didn't discover then until a drone was spotted at a very visible level after we heard a buzzing one afternoon over the front of our property. Once we spotted it it flew off to the back of the woods . I believe I heard another one flying in the woods on the same day just a few minutes after but never visibly seen it.Another drone, could have been the same one as before was also spotted again flying over the property line as it hovered above tree line. Of course not sure these are related but the drone was what opened our suspicions where we noticed the lights in the sky that are fairly low and definitely not normal. I believe to of seen tiny white droppings of light fall from one of these objects but no one else has noticed and I'm aware because of the creepiness my mind could be playing tricks on me.Although I am a firm believer in UFOs I'm hesitant to say that this could be one because of the fact they appear every night around the same time and they are at a constant hover. I believe this could be a drone case, but my research shows no investigations or surveillance using drones of this flight power in or around this area.If I can get a camera that can clearly record or photograph these objects I will send them in along with the date and times they are taken.",Duration:2-4 hours nightly,"Location: Camdenton, MO",Occurred : 9/5/2016 02:00  (Entered as : 9/5/16 2:00),Posted: 9/9/2016,Reported: 9/6/2016 2:45:05 PM 14:45,Shape: Unknown

The bottom of them seem to be spinning and it look like it had boosters in the rear. Was no smoke or trail behind the object and it seemed to seamlessly move across the sky at a slow to moderate rate. The last one we saw was going in a completely opposite direction the rest of them seem to be going in the general direction of the first one sighted.

1036,"Several UFOs buzz cruise ships in waters off Vancouver Island.This is a report of what I just witnessed at 8:46pm PDT, and again at 9:06pm PDT, on the evening of Saturday, Sept. 3, 2016, while watching two cruise ships on a web cam.While watching a cruise ship go past a web cam, situated at Columbia Beach, Parksville, BC, Canada; I saw, at first one, and then at least two more, lights flying across the sky from right to left, which would be roughly east to west.  The camera faces more or less north. Here is a link to the camera. http://www.bigwavedave.ca/webcams.php?cam=2 The first cruise ship was the 'Nieuw Amsterdam' at 8:46pm. (Yes that's how they spell it) Moments after the last light went to the west, it appeared as though several (Perhaps 3) dimmer lights went from west to east, or left to right, directly over the ship.I hope to include a file (PeterD.zip) with representative photos of the day and night view from this camera, as well as the paths that the lights took.As the second cruise ship, the 'Coral Princess' passed, at 9:06pm, a similar display occurred, but with only one light. It also passed in both directions.As you will see from the edited photos (Sorry no actual shots of the lights), the lights did not stay illuminated across the entire field of the camera. It appeared as though they were only interested in /illuminated when close to, the cruise ships.As this camera switches from normal colour to low light when darkness falls, the actual brightness of the objects/lights is impossible to gauge. All I can say, is that I thought I had seen a meteor at first. But after the entire display, I can't imagine how that many meteors traveling in both directions could have occurred in such quick succession.This report is true and factual to the best of my ability to recall.((name deleted)) in Nanaimo.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Parksville/Nanaimo (Canada), BC",Occurred : 9/3/2016 20:46  (Entered as : 09/03/16 20:46),Posted: 9/9/2016,Reported: 9/3/2016 10:36:17 PM 22:36,Shape: Light

Celestron Skymaster binoculars and my 10x50 Nikon binoculars.,chairs and multiple wireless devices. I usually allow 30 to 45 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dark however this event took me bu surprise.As I settled into my seat and started scanning the evening skies out of the dark 3 brilliant glowing white lights suddenly appeared. No slow build in intensity they just appeared.The 3 lights were in the shape of a perfect triangle. One on the top and two forming the bottom line of the triangle. My first thought was how interesting it is that 3 satellites suddenly appeared.I picked up my Nikon binoculars and focused on all 3. As I watched all 3 moved in a uniform pattern and never moved from the triangle shape they appeared in.My best guess is they appeared approximately 25 degrees above the skyline and close to 38 degrees north north east.As the triangle moved to the east the light intensity was consistent and brilliant.I continued to observe the 3 uniform lights for approximately 10 more seconds.By this time the lights rapidly faded to black at around 58 degrees north east.And as quickly as they appeared it's like someone hit the light switch. All 3 disappeared.Mr. Davenport, I perform this ritual nightly and have done so for at least 15 years.I know what satellites look like...I understand the way they move through the night skies and slowly faded out of view as the sun reflection passes.I'm not saying this was a UFO but I am saying I've never seen 3 satellites fly in formation and disappear all at once.Very bizarre event over the Northern skies of Reno NV.Take care sir!",Duration:15 seconds,"Location: Reno, NV",Occurred : 9/3/2016 20:27  (Entered as : 09/03/16 20:27),Posted: 9/9/2016,Reported: 9/3/2016 9:04:59 PM 21:04,Shape: Light

1050,"Two lights north of Las Vegas, hovering and eventually gliding until it disappeared.I was out working out in the backyard of my home at around 1am while listening to Coast to Coast am. My backyard faces north, the house faces south. I had a clear view of the northern sky, Nellis AFB is to my north east at about less than 7 miles from my home. I have seen many terrestrial and known objects in the skies: satellites, fireballs, shooting stars and even unique aircraft like the stealth bomber, all within the city limits. Tonight, I saw something that was very unconventional to the aforementioned objects. The object was simply two lights, one bright light and another less bright light at around the 11 o'clock mark above the brighter light. The object just appeared out of nowhere towards the north and not anywhere near the AFB, I would say the AFB is more north easterly while this object was straight north. The distance between the 2 lights was greater than the distance of an airplane's wingspan, that is what caught my eye. As I saw the object, the lights seemed to hoover and then eventually glide in perfect unison at an angle, the reason I think I was seeing it at an angle, is because I was assuming I was looking at a solid object but looking it at while it was making some sort of turn. The object glided and it seemed to move east at first and then eventually turned north and disappeared, the disappearance was odd because it seemed like it disappeared into some sort of haze or fog, but there were no clouds that night. It might have disappeared behind the mountain, but that does not explain how both lights just vanished, as if flying into a cloud, which I have seen aircraft do flying behind mountains and clouds.

They didn't appear to be moving and we got it on video.  I have definitely seen interesting lights in the sky in this area several times before so I did not think much of it...The following evening I was with my fiancé and a friend.

This time the light furthest to the right was brighter than the rest.  We decided to stay on the highway to continue watching these lights.  At one point we were heading directly underneath the brightest light.  When we got real close I observed a diamond shaped craft with four big lights on the bottom in a diamond pattern. In between those lights were a bunch of smaller white lights.  When we were directly under it my fiancé's phone screen froze and gray lines showed up across the screen.  Then my car radio went static.  There had to be other witnesses, everyone driving on the highway was slowing down to stare at these lights.  Once we were no longer directly underneath the ufo we witnessed 2 military aircraft show up out of nowhere and begin flying toward the lights.  One got close to the brightes! t one and quickly changed direction and flew away.

1063,"Friday evening September 2nd. my wife and I drove In our driveway about 9:20 p.m..  My wife got out of the car and looked up in the sky and said what are those strange orange lights.  I immediately looked up in the sky and saw 2 lights moving approximately Southwest, at the speed of a small aircraft.  I moved to a better vantage point and saw for lights moving Southwest in a diamond formation. I had my new Samsung Galaxy note 7 cell phone.  I pointed it to the sky and took 2 photos, and 2 videos.  This was over period of about 30 seconds.  The lights where as bright as Jupiter on a clear dark night.  They were flying in a perfect diamond formation, evenly spaced out.I am an amateur pilot, I am 67 years old my wife is 66 years old a retired school teacher. We are always looking up at aircraft.  The thing that struck us funny was there were no blinking red or green lights, nor white lights.  They were steady bright orange lights.  The other thing that was strange was, there was no sound.  It was perfectly quiet.  Small aircraft flying over I always hear the engines running and jet aircraft I just about always hear the jet engines, unless they are flying at extremely high altitudes.  These craft were moving at a very steady pace, that of a small Cessna 172 if it was flying about 1500 feet above the ground.  There should have been sound.  Not being any sound flying the speed they appeared to be going, they could have been going at mach speed with no sonic boom.

1064,"Were these stealth bombers or satellites or what the Hell were they?Headed home near the Springfield Airport, pulled into driveway, and my wife had remarked how it was so nice we could still see the sky here. I glanced just for a second, and focused for a moment on what I thought was a constellation... As my wife headed inside I noticed these were in fact objects (I believe to be aircraft flying at extremely high-altitude, perhaps satellites) flying at a slow pace in a triangular flight pattern with the lead object at a much lower altitude (brighter light). As I continued to focus on this area the objects maintained their slow pace & pattern. I have seen some of the stealth bombers flying in formation out here, in broad daylight, but those were flying at a much lower altitude (and the emission trail was unbelievable!)... being familiar with star-gazing I wouldn't put it past it that these were satellites... but I have NEVER seen so many satellites flying in a formation pattern like aircraft, I would imagine if these were satellites, they'd be at a relatively lower orbit than the many times I've seen satellites 'skipping' along before. There were at least 6 in one formation, with another two groups that I could see of around 6 or so staggered at the same incredible altitude.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1066,"One set of white flashing aviation lights became to singulr flashing lights.In explanation, I am a former military aircraft mechanic.While I was headed for the Union Pacific Depot to pick up a Houston bound off duty train crew, I observed what appeared to be an aircraft moving slowly, showing two white flashing tip lights (which I thought odd) headed North, North, East, following the Union Pacific train tracks.While stopped at the light, headed South on the Loop 274 at Texas Hwy [29*09.533N and 095*26.005W] I lowered my driver’s side window.  The light turned green and I progressed South on Loop 274. I could still see the flashing lights, hear the crossing bells ringing and multiple train engine noise, but hear no aircraft engine noise.  I stopped at Loop 274 and W. Plum to turn {right} onto W. Plum, the train was moving on the tracks in a Northerly direction {it’s engine noise fading}, but there was still no aircraft engine noise, I lost sight of the observed aircraft in the surrounding trees.At W. Plum and S. Erskine I turned left and still lost in the surrounding trees.  I again turned left at S. Erskine and W. Munson as I stopped at the yield sign I looked up toward the Union Pacific Radio tower {roughly 110ft tall} and still did not see aircraft flashing lights nor hear aircraft engine noise.  I crossed S. Hancock St. turned to the right, into the yard. I stopped then I backed to the right into my parking spot, shut of the vehicle engine.Out of the vehicle, as I collected my work gear, I again looked up at the tower [29*09.307N, 095*25.585W] and observed the two flashing white tip lights divide.Where there had been one silent single aircraft several hundred foot above the tower and railroad overpass there were two.  I only saw the lights no shapes.  One silent flashing light went to the North of the tower, the second silent flashing light went to the South of the tower.I ran to the Yard Office and asked the duty night manager to please step out onto the North East facing porch. I pointed to the two lights not far off, still slowly headed North, North, East now at least a city block apart and reported the odd sight following the train.I asked what might be so important that two silent aircraft with one bright flashing light each, would be following it.  He stated it was a regular run with no particular importance.I needed to go further to pick up the crew.

It moved in a mostly straight line almost like a satellite, but much slower - maybe a third the speed.  It may have meandered a bit, but that was hard to say as it was moving so slowly.  It grew dimmer over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, at which time we lost sight of it, it having moved no more than 10 degrees during that time.

1072,"Strange lights over large plum of smoke.I was at dinner with my husband at a local Chilli's.  It is off a major highway here, HW 49.  On our way there, we saw a very large plum of smoke rising into the sky, like something massive was on fire.  When we arrived I noticed it was still coming up from the ground, so I took a picture and sent it to my mother, asking if she had heard on the news of anything burning.  She checked our local news website and found nothing, saying it might have been a controlled burn.  When I looked at the picture I noticed a series of strange lights hovering over the smoke.  Where we live there are no tall buildings, the tallest is 15 stories, and these lights were easily as high as some clouds.  There is an airport close to this area, but behind where I am taking the picture from.  The only thing in the area of the picture is a lot of woods and some small residential neighborhoods.  The amount of smoke that was coming up looked like it must have been coming from a massive forest fire, or something similar, it certainly isn't what you would see with a house fire.  Having lived here my entire life, I have never witnessed airplanes flying this close together, some of these lights appear to be in a triangular formation, while others just contain two lights.  There was also the absence of any blinking or red lights as most airplanes have.  If you look at the photo and zoom in, to the left of the obvious bright series of lights, there are also some duller ones visible.  I cannot readily explain what these are.

I also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so I went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual Friday night sleep time.Perhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, I was awake but still in my bed.  There was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference).  The light came from a white ball of light. It was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and I had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it.  The light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun.  It must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim.I remember that right before I turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw.  It was itching and I remember that I brushed my neck with both hands downward.I don't remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and I was laid down on my bed the entire time;  I also dont remember if my lower body was immobile.The next day, I got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. My friend later noticed that I was behaving a little bit agitated while I was looking for a parking spot at mall. It could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related.But our lunch was the last meat I have eaten for the past three months. Somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and I dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore.  My diet has become almost vegetarian.  I do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but I know I can also live without them.  My weight dropped and I felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months.What really blew my mind was a physical evidence that I cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress.  This event had left a physical mark on my chest.  I found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies.  It has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour.  There is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it.  Of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months.I don't sense it was a malevolent encounter and I have not had another one since then, or at least any that I can remember.",Duration:Few minutes,"Location: Toronto (Canada), ON",Occurred : 9/2/2016 00:00  (Entered as : 09/02/16 0:00),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 12/4/2016 9:05:24 AM 09:05,Shape: Sphere

1103,"6 to 7 bright white lights on triangular craft - North ColumbusMy girlfriend and I were watching the sky again, and we saw something flying in the distance, the craft came from the same direction, and did the same exact movements as it had the night before.  It actually descended vertically with no horizontal movement.  We saw no red or green lights present on the craft.  (Indicating a commercial or even military aircraft.)  It came from the North, until it got around some trees, made a gradual 90 degree turn and began heading to the West.  (In the direction of the airport here.)  We see tons of planes coming in and landing all day, everyday.  This thing was not a commercial airliner. It was flying entirely too slow, too low, and was way too quiet to be a passenger airliner, and had too many lights on it.  (And in the wrong places/not having the correct lights for an airplane.)  It flew pretty slowly past the house, it was probably about 100 - 250 feet away (maybe a bit more) from the house, and it was flying at a pretty low altitude, I'd guess somewhere around maybe 200-400 feet area possibly.  I actually managed to snap a few quick pictures of the thing, which I will attach to this.What was odd to me was the fact that there weren't any other airplanes coming in for about 10 - 15 minutes before this craft came, and nothing came in to the airport for about 15 - 20 minutes after we saw the craft.  There is also an Air Force base pretty close by (Rickenbacker AFB), but that base is roughly 30 minutes to the South of us.This one did have a sound, like a plane - but a very, very quiet plane. (It was more quiet than a single prop airplane.) We didn't hear the noise of it until it was passing the house, and for a brief moment after it had already passed by the house. It had at least 6 - 7 bright white lights present on it. (That's only counting the lights on the left side and back side of the craft.) It was very dark, but it was most likely a black craft, and the way the lights were situated on the craft, it had to be a triangular craft.Note:  Normally we hear crickets outside all night long, but when this craft hovered past us, it was dead quiet outside with the occasional sound of vehicles on the nearby highways and the craft when it hovered by.",Duration:3-5 minutes,"Location: Columbus, OH",Occurred : 8/30/2016 23:56  (Entered as : 08/30/2016 23:56),Posted: 9/2/2016,Reported: 8/31/2016 6:30:22 PM 18:30,Shape: Triangle

1120,"Saucer seen on I-26 and Ladson RdSo, I’m a student. I got out of class sometime after 9:30 and I hit the interstate.  I got on Ashley Phosphate, took 1-26 West to get off on exit 205 A. As I’m going down the road, I see this bright light. It was just a small circular light- I assumed it was a airplane.  It approached, like one. I like planes so I was watching it, waiting for it to pass over me, but instead it stayed in the distance.  I found it odd, about 2 minutes passed and I watched it slowly make its way over to the left side of the interstate and it descended into the trees.  I was so confused, because the only airport I know of is the one alll the way back after exit 212.  So. Right as this “plane” descends, I see another one.  This one has two lights on each end. Different colors.  I automatically assume that it’s a helicopter.  It slowly makes it’s way over the interstate and then it pauses too.. I put on my glasses and watch it slowly descend into the trees.  About a mile away from the! first one.  I was so confused, if these were helicopters, why were they landing in that area? I’m not too familiar with the area but I knew there was no landing spots there.  So just as I see it disappear within the trees.. I see another as I’m passing by the signs saying 205 B is coming up.This one, it wasn’t really moving. I stared at it all the way to my exit.  It was close to ground. I couldn’t make out the object at first but once I came up to the exit, it was directly above me man. It had very dim lights on it.  Now at this point “ufo” was going through my mind, the craft looked so odd.  I was eyeballing this thing hard as I drove around the loop and came up on University Blvd?  I rolled down my window just to listen, to see if it made any sound. It was so quiet.  I watched this thing HOVER from my right side over to my left side.  As I was coming down the hill, a car pulls full of boys are passing me, and I watched the guy i the passenger and he screams “DUUUUUDE” and they take off.  That made me feel better, I knew I wasn’t just seeing things.  It’s pretty high up in the air, but it was so close.. I’m not good at describing distance so I can’t tell you but as I was driving down that hill to get to Ladson, I was in sync with the object.It was getting lower and lower to the ground.  I get to the light, turn left on Ladson, and I’m going as slow as I can, just keeping up with it.  I’m going about 15mph on a 45?  And I follow it to Ladson Elementary School.  It was right there..  It wasn’t in the street, it was hovering over the parking lot of the school?  It had these  strange dim lights that looked so out of place, and the object moved so slow in mid air. I could see it’s shape now, as it slowly shifted from horizontal to vertical. It was a saucer. Just as it did that, it spit something, it was like a tiny pill shaped object that had a white glow to it,  it was big enough for me to see. Right after that I hauled ass.  I got so emotional and so scared. As I’m getting to my friends house, I see military planes in the sky, going towards the direction from which  I came.	I arrive to her house and I bolt to her door, I think I see  a drone or two flying over her neighborhood, I’m so freaked out. I knock on her door then just barge in, I was too scared to stay outside. I went ballistic and was telling them what happened, they look outside and see the drones. We stayed there for about 20 minutes before leaving again.  As we’re getting in the car, a light in the sky is coming our way, it looked like the first flying object I saw, but it revealed itself to be a plane.  But this plane was scoping.  It was cruising through the sky. And when we left her neighborhood and went back up Ladson, I watched these huge trucks pull into the back of the school, and then the cruiser plane  flew across the street.	We get to the gym. Work out. Leave. Go back to Ladson. It’s about 12:40 when we get to the light to turn onto Ladson. That plane was still in the sky scoping and those trucks were just leaving the area. I go home. I couldn’t sleep. Needed the lights on to sleep. Haha. There were people on the road, and many people on the interstate that could've saw too.. It really sucks you know. I wish I didn’t see that. I mean. That was cool. Really cool. But. Overwhelming. I just want to know the truth but I guess it’s better to just mind my business.",Duration:10 minutes?,"Location: Ladson, SC",Occurred : 8/30/2016 09:50  (Entered as : 08/30/16 09:50),Posted: 9/2/2016,Reported: 8/31/2016 9:07:37 AM 09:07,Shape: Disk
1121,"White dot over boulderFirst noticed at 6:40 AM.  Sun was coming up, it was bright out.  No stars left but one to the NNW.  Bright star, not flashing or twinkling.  I pointed out to my co-worker the star and said it was most likely a planet.  I'm a recent college graduate that took a handful of astronomy and cosmology courses and I'm extremely skeptical of UFO phenomenon.  But I felt something was off when I realized the sun was up and all the planets should have been on the ecliptic further to the left an lower.  Checked location of planets: Jupiter, Venus and Mercury all following sun up, Uranus and Neptune setting, Saturn, Mars and Pluto all below the horizon.  This ""star"" isn't on the ecliptic at all, too far north.  I crossed checked with star charts, nothing matches.  As 08:40 rolls around it's still up.  Hasn't moved (if it is a celestial body it should be moving west, but hasn't).  It's getting bright out and still very visible.  As the sun got higher it looked more like metal! reflecting light than a star. Looks artificial and not natural. I estimate the object was 70 degrees above the horizon (not counting the mountains.  I used clenched fists to estimate sextants about 10 degrees).  The ""star"" still visible with the sun 40 degrees above the horizon.  Aircraft from DIA seemed to be flying east to west normally below it. Another coworker showed up about 09:00 and we both observed it for 30 minutes. In that time frame it moved 30 degrees south.  Pointed object out to two passerby at 09:40 and they could see it and agreed it was strange.  The object was brightly visible until 10:00.  By then it was directly west.  Hate to be that guy but since there is atmospheric research going on here it could be weather ballon?  When I looked at it through binocs it had circle large shape, it was clear with ribs.  Seemed to morph from circle to oval.

1126,"Glowing orange rectangular object, slow moving and making no sound.I take a nightly walk every night down the same street, so I would consider myself fairly familiar with the different land marks of the area.  I have lived in this neighborhood for 10+ years and know what to expect from neighbors lighting off fireworks or a plan flying overhead.  It was a very clear, cool and calm night with lots of stars out, no breeze, low humidity and no clouds in the sky.On this nightly walk I had barely rounded the corner on the block headed away from my house and heading east when I noticed an orange glowing object in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a plane, this thought only lasted a few seconds as I realized it was heading in a westerly direction towards me and also ascending very slowly.  In this second I stopped and watched it.It was about the size of a street lamp when you are standing under a street lamp but did not shine like a street lamp.  In fact, it just glowed and cast no light.  It made no sound.  Was rectangular in shape with the longer ends being on the top and bottom.  The top may have also been bigger.  It also had a weird halo underneath it.  The color was a very rich orange color.  It did not fluctuate in color or intensity.  It was hard to tell distance at night but I would say maybe 200-300 yards away from me?  Maybe more?  I turned around and began to quickly walk home realizing I could not explain what I was seeing.  I pulled out my phone and texted my partner that I “See a UFO”.The time of that text was 21:58. I was scared mostly because it appeared like it would fly over me if it continued.  I thought about filming it but for some reason didn’t feel like I had time.As a quickly walked home, keeping my head over my shoulder to watch the object, I turned the corner to the street my house is on I saw the object pulse about 2 times and then shrink in size before completely going out.

1138,"2 unidentified objects seen early morning in Davidson County, TN.I was about to fall asleep around 4am when I saw a light through the blinds of my window.  I have a natural curiosity about UFOs, so I got up and took a closer look.  It was hard to tell what I was looking at.  It looked very similar to a star, but it wasn't flashing how a sta would through our atmosphere.I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out exactly what it was.  I was convinced it was moving, but thought I was just tired and maybe I was just seeing things.  I started to block the object using frames of the window, and realized it slowly but definitely was moving back into my vision.  I did this multiple times.  I opened my window so I had a full view, and went back to my bed to watch this object.For the next hour or so, the object very slowly moved back and forth. It changed direction quite a few times, but it never went very far. I could judge its position by where it was in relation to my window frames.  At one point, it got close enough for me to see there were multiple lights to it.  I cant confirm the shape, but I was leaning towards a triangle or boomerang type object.Towards the end of my sighting, the object started to move upwards and become smaller and more distant.  At this point, the sun was beginning to rise and it was the only object visible in the sky other than the moon.  All of the stars I had seen prior were no longer visible.  This object had to have been very bright, and very big.At this point I had to get back up to watch it, as the object had completely left my view of the window.  I got up to watch it and realized it had become a speck.  I couldn't believe how astonishingly high it got.  This way way too high to be a plane or a drone, and satellites don't maneuver the way this object did.  At times it was completely still, but became more active towards the middle and end of my sighting.Second Object:  At this point its about 5:40 A.M.The first object was extremely high, just a little dot.  I then noticed a second craft MUCH lower in my vision.  I had mistaken it for a cloud at first, but it was an object darting across the sky leaving a small trail.  It was travelling at an awkward angle, and I could not notice any lights on this one.  There was quite a bit of natural light in the sky at this point.  I took a video of this one.  The other object was too distant to show up on my camera.The craft was only in my vision for about 10 seconds, and left no visible trail after it left my field of view.  The object I had originally seen was somehow still visible, extremely high up there.  About 5 minutes later, it was either gone, or there was too much natural light to observe it further.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the first possibility to be ruled out would be a star in the morning sky.

1141,"Two UFO / UAP Sightings North Of Toronto, Canada — Sunday, Aug 28, 2016.Did anyone else have a sighting in Toronto, Sunday night between 10-10:30PM?  Approximately 10PM EST, Sunday August 28, 2016, over Newmarket, north of Toronto, Canada, two of us were sitting in the backyard facing East (see the photo below where the sun is rising the next morning with StarTracker Lite App superimposed to show the sky from Sunday night).Traveling from North to South (left to right in the picture above) across the eastern sky at a speed that was like a shooting star was a craft that was oval in appearance, seemingly wide like a plane, at a height approximating what a commercial jet would be flying overhead.From our sitting position on the backyard deck, it passed slightly above the trees as it sped South for a count of “1 and 2 and…” then continued with its view obstructed by the trees in a slightly wider field of view than the photo above.  Initially we asked ourselves if this could be a meteorite but having already seen two a little earlier, it was clearly uncharacteristic of a meteorite. It was oval as if it might have wings but they were not perceptible wings.  It was more like an energy pulse extending to each side like wings.  It appeared as a quickly pulsating, oscillation with long, oval arch to each side.  The rapid pulsing to each side of its center was extremely fast.Imagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tiger’s stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate.  That is how it appeared to me, though to Alison sitting beside me, it was more like a subdued yet oval light swishing across the sky in a dark halo surrounding it.Unlike the meteorite that arched down from the sky towards the horizon like the two meteorites that we witnessed earlier, this UAP flew straight across the sky at a speed that is comparable to a meteorite.  The energy was electric.  The sky was the clearest we have seen all summer.Approximately 30-minutes later, at 10:32pm, we saw exactly the same phenomenon in the same exact line of vision, but this time traveling from South to North.  Notably, it was moving approximately at half the speed of the original sighting for a count of “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and…” then the trees obstructed our view.  At that speed, it was speeding much faster than a jet fighter would across the sky.  There was no sound at all. Again, there was an electric, energetic feel to the energy filling the air, possibly our own excitement from what we saw.This is the sky photographed on my iPhone 5s taken immediately after.  Though the phone was in my hand, the craft moved much too quickly to take a shot.I believe these are the solar systems and stars that were visible, though I am not 100% certain of their exact placement, according to the StarTracker Lite App on my phone.  Very grainy shot, but it offers perspective of where we were sitting and what we saw pass across our field of view.The next morning at approximately 7:30am I went outside to photograph the sun rising in the exact same spot we witnessed the sighting Sunday night, to have a clear perspective of where we had witnessed the UAPs for this report.  Upon downloading the images to my computer, one of the shots taken had a bright spot above the sun.When enlarged, two objects are revealed.  What is particularly interesting is that the seeming light source is at the top, north side of the spheres and they exhibit a shadow to the bottom south side.While I have won awards for my photography and work in television, I am not an expert with Photoshop nor do I have proper tools for analysis.  My question to the readers out there:  Is this image typical of lens flair?  Is it something else that is naturally explainable?   Or, is this a genuine capture of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon or UFO?  That daylight photo aside, what we saw Sunday evening took our breath away.

His words were:  “No way, no way.”  He also saw the lights underneath it.  Called my husband to come out and look.

My first impression was that the sunlight was reflecting off this ""thing"" as to why I looked up. So as I was on the phone, I started to look where the sun was located. The sun was located over my right shoulder and house. However it wasn't a constant reflection. It seemed as if it was rotating sideways and every time it rotated, it would reflect or flash.

The object changed shapes from a circle to a cone and back to a circle and seemed to have something like a satellite flying around it.

1168,"SIX RED LIGHTS IN A ROW TRAVELING SOUTH EAST NEAR HOLLISTERI WAS WATERING THE LAWN IN THE BACK YARD OF MY HOUSE IN HOLLISTER, CALIFORNIA.  IT WAS A NICE CLEAR NIGHT WITH A SLIGHT OFF-SHORE BREEZE OUT OF THE EAST.  AT ABOUT 8:45PM, LOOKING NORTH, I NOTICED A LOW FLYING RED LIGHT, TRAVELING FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST.  AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS THE AVERAGE CESSNA AIRCRAFT AT 50 DEG. ABOVE THE HORIZON.  I RAN AND GOT MY PHONE TO CALL SOME PEOPLE BUT DECIDED TO TRY TO GET VIDEO OF IT WITH THE PHONE, KNOWING THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING USABLE.  AFTER A FEW SECONDS ANOTHER RED LIGHT CAME INTO VEIW FOLLOWING THE FIRST FLYING AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER ALTITUDE AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AT AN ARMS LENGTH BEHIND THE OTHER ONE.  BY THIS TIME I HAD GOT TO THE VERY TOP OF AN EIGHT FOOT LADDER THAT WAS ALREADY SET UP IN THE YARD SO I COULD GET UP ON THE ROOF AND WATCH THESE THINGS AS LONG AND FAR AS POSSABLE.  A THIRD OBJECT CAME INTO VEIW SAME ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE AS THE PREVIOUS AND THEN ANOTHER MAKING FOUR! RED LIGHTS FLYING IN A LINE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER.  HERE I WAS ON THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT BOXERS AND ALL ALONE WATCHING THESE GUYS TRAVEL BY AND NOBODY AROUND TO YELL TO SOO THEY CAN SEE ALSO.  WITH THE LIGHTS ALMOST OUT OF VEIW ON THE EASTERN HORIZON I WAS GETTING READY TO GET OFF THE ROOF THEN ANOTHER TWO LIGHTS CAME INTO VEIW FLYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PREVIOUS BUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSER AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER.  THE FITH LIGHT WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST AND THE SIXTH SLIGHTLY LOWER BUT STILL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS FOUR.  I AM A 37 YEAR OLD EXPERIENCED ASTRONOMER USING A LARGE TELESCOPE FOR MANY YEARS, I KNOW WHAT SATELLITES LOOK LIKE AND HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PATHS AND SUCH.   I AM SURE THAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WERE NOT DRONES,CHINESE LANTERNS, WEATHER BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS OR ANY NORMAL AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE LACK OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND MARKERS REQUIRED ON ALL AIRCRAFT NOR WERE THERE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT AROUND IN THE SKY.  AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO AFTER THE SIXTH LIGHT PAST BY, I DECIDED TO GET OFF THE ROOF AND JUMP IN MY CAR.  I TOOK NOTE OF THE TIME 9:05PM PACIFIC AND AS FAST AS I COULD I GRABBED SOME PANTS,NIGHT VISION,CAMERA AND SOME BINOCULARS WHICH WERE ALL TOGETHER ON THE DINING TABLE.  I HAD ALL OF THESE THINGS READY TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE OBSERVERD THESE RED LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE WEEKS PRIOR WHICH WERE REPORTED TO THIS WEB SITE.  WHILE I WAS GETTING DRESSED A LOW FLYING HELICOPTER FLEW OVER MY HOUSE FROM THE SOUTH TOWARDS THE NORTH THAT HAD ONLY A FLASHING RED LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT THIS WAS LIKELY THE NORMAL MEDIVAC HELICOPTER. I HAVE HAD AN IN MY FACE CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 2001 OF A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WISH NEVER HAPPEND AND SINCE THEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I SAW WITH COUNTLESS HOURS OF READING AND LISTENING TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE LINKED TO THE SUBJECT IN A QUEST TO GET SOME SORT OF ANSWER TO WHAT I OBSERVED. LAST WEEK I CALLED AM1080 KSCO, A LOCAL AM RADIO STATION AND ASKED THEM TO ! ASK PEOPLE IN THE AREA IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I HAVE ASKED POLICE OFFICERS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT IS FLYN AROUND ABOVE US. I TAKE THIS KIND OF STUFF SERIOUSLY AND WOULD SAY THAT I AM NOT OVERLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT BUT SOME MAY THINK OTHERWISE. ANYWAYS HERE I AM HAULN BUTT DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR WITH MY EQUIPTMENT IN HAND IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP WITH THESE LIGHTS AND REALIZE THAT I DONT HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL OF CATCHING UP WITH THESE THINGS AND DECIDE TO STOP AT THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE AROUND THE BLOCK. I PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I EVEN TURN OFF THE CAR FOUR KIDS RANGING IN AGE FROM 4 TO 12 COME RUNNING UP TO ME ASKING IF I SAW THE RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I TOLD THE KIDS HOLD ON A MINUTE AND TOOK OFF BACK TO MY HOUSE TO GET MY DIGITAL RECORDER. I AM FAMILIAR WITH INTERVEIWING PEOPLE AND KNOW THAT QUESTIONING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS ALWAYS GOES BETTER IF THEY DONT KNOW T! HEY ARE BEING RECORDED, IT MAY NOT BE TOTALY LEAGAL BUT I FIGU! RE ITS T HE BEST WAY TO DOCUMENT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TELL ME. TURNS OUT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING A FEW RED LIGHTS IN THE WESTERN SKY SINCE ABOUT 8:00PM AND HAD CALLED ME TO TELL ME BUT I DID NOT HAVE MY PHONE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BOXERS WATERING MY LAWN. THE KIDS EVEN DRUG OUT A TELESCOPE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TO WATCH THE LIGHTS AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WATCHED A RED LIGHT IN THE WEST STAY STATIONARY FOR OVER A HALF OF AN HOUR THEN WATCHED IT GAIN A LITTLE ALTITUDE AND THEN TAKE OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE OBJECTS WOULD DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION I RECORDED THESES FOUR KIDS SEPERATLY AND GOT SOME EXELENT STUFF.

1180,"Intensely white round object moving over 4-lane highway in daylight and hit my carOn August 26, 2016, at 19:31 hours, I was driving north in the right lane on I-39 going around Stevens Point, traveling about 69 mph.  Where this sighting occurred, I-39 is actually going in an East-West direction.  There was no precipitation and relatively clear sky.  The sun would soon be setting at about the 9 o’clock position to my car.  The distant trees and buildings on the south side of the road in this location would block the sun from coming into my car.I noticed at about the 11 o’clock position, there was an intensely bright white round-shaped object about 600’ away and moving relatively slow in an easterly direction about 25’ above the ground. When I noticed it, it appeared to be about 20” in diameter and just beyond the south side of the road. It then dipped down, then up to about 40’ above the ground, greatly picking up speed as it then curved to the North/NE and passed over the ‘south-bound’ lanes.  As it moved over the approximately 50’ of median plus road shoulders it dipped downward coming directly towards my car and hitting the middle of my windshield, glancing off, and continuing NE in a straight line.  As it hit it made a very loud, heavy ‘dunk’ sound followed by a ‘clink’.  From my right side window, I saw it go straight to the NE and then was out of my sight.  At the moment of impact, from the loud sound I had braced for the windshield to break apart or at the very least be cracked.  To my amazement it didn’t break ! apart.  I continued approximately two miles to my destination and examined the windshield.  I could not find a single trace of anything on it: no breakage, cracks, or smudges of any type.When I first saw the object, I thought it was a large bird.  However, as I continued to watch it as it crossed the south-bound lanes and get closer, it appeared to diminish to about 6” in diameter with what appeared to be a heavy 6” tail like that of a comet’s dust tail by the time it hit my car.  I don’t know if it actually had a heavy ‘dust trail’ or if that was my brain trying to track its movement.  I do know that with it coming within 24” of my face there were no wings, feathers, beak, eyes, feet, or anything remotely resembling a bird or of any other color:  Just a very intense white ball-shape.  In addition, when fowl or animals hit a vehicle, they usually hit with a ‘thud’ sound due to the compression of soft tissue.  And a bird’s beak usually hits before or during impact, not afterward and usually has a different sound other than the ‘clink’ I heard.  Plus there will usually be some type of smudge or residue on the glass.  I was very puzzled by whatever it was that I saw and hit my windshield, but since there was no damage done,  I chalked it up to being ‘unknown’.  That changed October 22, 2016, with a similar sighting at night.

1191,"At around 4:15 p.m.,as I was waiting to pick my child up from basketball practice, I noticed a small silver circular object in the sky.  It wasn't moving, it stayed in the same location.  There were no lights on the object.  As I stared at it, I started to notice more in different areas of the sky, yet not too far away from the others.  None of them were moving, and they all looked the same.  I saw at least 7.  As I stared at them, they fades away and disappeared. I searched the sky but couldn't find any.  A few seconds later, they reappeared. Mostly in the same spots however there were some in different spots.  Still, never moving. They hovered there for another minute or 2 and faded away again, this time i didnt see them anymore.  I attempted to take a picture but the camera of my phone isn't very good.  A couple of things I noticed during this time was there were no birds flying while the objects were visible, as soon as they disappeared for the last and final time, birds befan to fly around again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1199,"Streak of light over whitehall NY pauses then vanishes is a flash of light lasted just seconds suprised on lookers can't justifyAt about 9:45PM last night (8/24/16), my family and I were driving home to Glens Falls, NY, on our way back from vacation in Maine.  We were driving towards Whitehall, NY, at the time we saw it we were just outside Whitehall.  I'd say 5 miles or less.  So, I was just driving along, when at the above stated time out of my left side view looking out the windshield of my car I saw a streak of light.  That at first glance looked like a shooting star.  It didn't take me long to realize that that was not what I was looking at.  There was something about the way it was moving that made me look again a little deeper.  Now for context this whole thing lasted just seconds but, you know when you spot something.  Out of the corner of your eye that actually inside you peripheral far enough were you get a good enough look at it.  To the point that I'm driving forward focused on the road but can see the light moving in to my course of vision. that's what happened.  So, I saw this light and it registers after just a second this is peculiar.  So now is when I shift my view or focus out that side of the windshield to actually see this light that was acting funny.. so, this light moves into view, the first thing that didn't jive was the speed at which it was moving.  Much too slow to be a shooting star.  Then, I noticed the streak of light was thicker than it would be if it were a shooting star.  Then, of course, i saw a shape in front of the streak.  This is the hardest thing to describe I can't remember a shape per se as much as the color which was the same bright, white light as the streak but separate from it.  (if I had to say a shape it would be oval or tear drop shaped) so now, the streak came in to view streaked for a few seconds as if slowing down cause then it paused (or stopped dead) for a moment.  This is when I new we had just seen something extraordinary.  The following thing that happened was a flash of light and it vanished. It shot off in some direction so fast I couldn't even see it. and that's when I turned ! to my wi fe and said what the hell was that!?  Did you see that?

North of me a couple of miles ahead, I saw what looked like a bright star but it was too early for stars to be that bright in the north.  The sun had set, but the sky was still bright in the west.  As I got closer, I noticed that the light wasn't moving in any direction.  It wasn't blinking like a tower or a plane is required to do because of air traffic.  Then I saw that it was actually two lights right next to each other.I passed it at the intersection of Rt. 45 and Wheat Ave.  There was a line of trees for a distance before I got to that intersection and I struggled to see the lights until I passed the trees almost at the intersection.  The lights were at least 300-400 feet up in the air by my best estimate.  About as high as a tall tower, or wind turbine maybe higher, but not much. They were several feet apart from each other.  My windows were down, I was driving about 40 mph and there was no wind.  It was dead calm other than the wind from my driving and I heard nothing.  No engine noise, no rotor thumping.  And the lights were not moving, nor was there anything blinking.I drove back by the same spot at 8:45-8:50 pm and the lights were gone.  When I got home, I wrote up what I saw and posted on Facebook and a friend of mine said her son saw the same thing about 8:45 as they were also driving north.  He said the lights suddenly ‘took off’ were the words he used, towards Champaign, IL to the south.

To the right of the palm tree, I observed something in the sky that I had never seen before.  There was a white rectangular object hanging in the sky. It looked like a flat screen TV.  I slowed down and rolled down my window to see if there was any sound and there wasn’t.  I was expecting it would move but it didn’t. I thought it might be an ad on a blimp and I would see writing but I didn’t.  I looked back several times over my left shoulder, and could tell it wasn’t attached to anything, nor did it produce any advertisements.  There were no lights attached. I was curious that it had a mist behind it, as well as a clumpy looking cloud on the left hand side.  I can’t remember if it was upper or lower but was on the left hand side.  I was so focused on the object that I don’t recall any other vehicles around the area.  I was concerned about causing an accident, so, I started driving faster and paying attention to the road. Further up the road, before reaching my left turn I thought I would take one last look over my left shoulder and see if I could see it. I was startled to see a black one directly to my left.  Same exact shape, mist behind it, as well as the exact same clump of cloud appearance, only this cloud was darker.  The mist and clouds did not look a real cloud produced by nature.  I slowed down almost to a stop and stared. It didn’t move.  Once again I felt I was a hazard so drove to my left turn to get home.  I thought I would never see it again, but, took one last look back. my sight was obstructed by tall trees and houses so, I couldn’t see it if it was still there. I thought, I will just focus on getting home safely. I proceeded to my last left turn to get home and as I looked to the right to see if there were any cars coming I saw a grey one. It was moving fast an! d was already quite a distance away. It was headed northeast. ! Instead of turning on my street, I followed the road to the right and was going to stop and get a picture. By the time I stopped it was moving so fast I couldn’t get my cell phone out to take a picture. I couldn’t see any dimension to the objects other than they were rectangular, and they were not shiny. They were more of a matte.

After clearing the warning buoys in the bay we proceeded out and head due west at full speed. We were heading for the 2 large islands on the west end of the lake. The trip would take apx 35-40 minutes.The sun had not come up yet but as it did begin to rise we took a few pics (Iphone 5S) (while moving). I was driving the boat, but at a slow speed. I turned around to snap a few pics of the sun which was in full beautiful view, and ended up with an excellent picture of the sunrise. at this point we were well out on the lake with only the water around us and the sky above.A week later as I was reviewing my pictures and posting them to facebook, I noticed that I had captured something in the picture that we were not aware of during the fishing trip. The object is on the far left middle of the pic, and appears higher than us and above the water.The picture does not show the entire craft, only a portion of it...but you can see structure to it, and It has  definite angles to the design, and you can see the rising sun shining on it / illuminating it.We heard nothing that morning except the wind, waves and the roar of the boats motor. We saw nothing other than the sunrise...I have zoomed in on the object and it is not a ""normal"" saucer shaped UFO, but it does have well defined surfaces that reflect light.

The first one disappeared to the NNW into light cloud cover.  That may help you understand the altitude.  About 15 seconds after the first disappeared from sight, a second followed the same track from SSE to NNW ... same apparent speed and altitude.  The second seemed more red than orange on the travelling ""front"" edge of the ball.  Hard to say the true size, since an actual distance couldn't really be determined.  From my view, they both appeared to be about the size of a pea in the night sky (fairly clear out this! evening, with a nice view of the stars).

But those are often loud and usually have red and green lights, if any.  This was a single orange light that was floating silently from southwest to northeast.  I was only able to see it for about 5 minutes before it just suddenly vanished.  Frustratingly, it disappeared before I could get any pictures.It happened a second time tonight (08/22/16).  It was about 2:40 AM, I was staying up late doing some reading and I heard an extremely loud and percussive boom from outside, it sounded like a grenade went off across the street.  It was echoing off of nearby hills it was so loud. I ran outside to see what was happening, dogs were barking all around the neighborhood because of the sound.  I thought about the light from 2 nights ago and started looking up to see if it was there, sure enough, the same glowing orange light was silently floating above my neighborhood, this time it was much higher in altitude, maybe 500-1000 feet.  Again, it  was floating from southwest to northeast, irregularly pulsing in a red-orange hue.  A bit redder than a campfire usually is.  This time though, it kept moving until it suddenly stopped moving and was stationary in the sky.  I was able to get an old telescope out to get a better look, but I couldn’t see any definite features.  Even in the telescope it ! was just an orange light.  To the naked eye it looked completely stationary, but in the telescope you see it slowing moving around, hovering in place. It slowly faded away until it disappeared about 20 minutes after I started watching it.  This time I was able to capture a few pictures of it on my cellphone, which doesn’t show much other than a dot in the sky, but it does show up.  Very weird experiences.  I’m going to try and be watchful and study it more, if it happens again.",Duration:>20 minutes,"Location: Perris, CA",Occurred : 8/22/2016 02:49  (Entered as : 08/22/16 2:49),Posted: 8/25/2016,Reported: 8/22/2016 4:19:38 AM 04:19,Shape: Fireball

1246,"Bright white flashing and moving light that followed along side 2 passengers in a car over 20 miles up above the tree line at nightOn the night of August 22, 2016, me and my brother were traveling home at about 1:30 to 2:00 in the morning.  We were coming from a town called Mauriceville, heading home, when I knotice out the passenger side window, a white flashing light that was up right above the tree line.  I brushed it off thinking it was a cellphone tower but when we got to the point on the road were we were parralel to the light it began to follow the car in the sense that we was traveling at about 75mph but the light was staying parallel to the car so it must have been flying over the trees at the same speed we were going.  So at this point we were about half way between Mauriceville and Buna, so I told my brother to pull the car over to the side of the road and when he did to our surprise, the light had also stopped movingng.  I decided to get out of the car so I could get a better view of it and when I got out I didnt hear any natural noises at all,  No wind,  No crickets, just The muffled! sound of The car engine.  The light was still there, over the trees and it was still flashing just as bright as when I noticed it.  So I got back in the car and we kept going and sure enough it continued to follow along side us for at least 10 miles at which point it completely stopped flashing all together and it wasn't there anymore.  This last moment was right before you would get into Buna.  I did not take my eyes off of it at nearly anytime it was there and have no idea what it was, why it was following beside us or what caused it to disapear!

If this is of any help, I do carry the ""gift"" of photographic memory, so I can draw what it is I saw in extreme detail. My Experience.Where: back roads, pitch black sky, it was cloudy out.  Driving beside an empty corn field.When: early morning, 01:17am.Direction: viewing east What:  7 bright stared lights in a single file fashion.  White.  Couldn't see if they were connected.Addinal info: upon noticing the lights my cars engine stopped and head lamps turned off. My phone turned off as well.  Car restored power, along with my phone after it left. Movement: the lights darted east (and out of sight) for only a moment before returning to its original spot and darting back east again and It did this 4 times before finally darting east off into Lake Michigan.Weird after effects: all my school work saved on my flash drives were unreadable to any computer. My new laptop was also shot. Also, it felt like a minute event but somehow an hour and a half went by.I seriouly doubt this matters but minutes after, I saw a man standing in the woods glaring at me and scared me half to death.  He was wearing a black suit, unbelievably tall and wore this hat from like, the 1920s or something.  He looked exactly like slender man.  I still get the blood chill even as I type this.

In the curve of the road, right around the FedEx facility, I saw something out my driver's side window, at about 45 degrees south/southwest.  It was a fairly large, super-intense white light, circular in shape, moving at an incredible speed, coming from the northwest and moving southeast.  When people count by saying ""1 Mississippi"", this would have been more like ""1 M"" in duration.  The best way I can describe the object is, it looked like a rotating, flat spiral of white light.  In the dimmer arms of the spiral I may have detected a very faint yellow.  Picture the rotating spiral of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'. The location I saw this object in is immediately south of Little Rock Airport  (Clinton Airport).  I checked the flight schedules when I got home, and while departures were not listed, the last arrival was at least a couple of hours before my sighting.  This is not an airport that has much late night airplane activity.  I also looked up types of commercial aircraft lights when I got home, but didn't see anything similar to what I had seen.  I do know that Little Rock Air Force Base does practice maneuvers using Little Rock Airport runways and airspace, but they are a C-130 base.

They started to form shapes, first a big circle then a vertical line and then a strange symbol like a question mark.They moved in groups of 3 and were constantly blinking.

1263,"My wife and I were in Chicago and we witnessed 8 orange/red/bright spheres slowly going overhead.  I am ex Navy and stationed on the USS Midway back in te mid 80's.  I worked on the flight deck identifying aircraft so they could set the arresting gear for the correct plane landing (I know my aircraft) - you use the color and shape of the pylons on the aircraft to identify it.  This was way slower and way lower than a regular plane would fly. It was much smaller too.  Perhaps 800 - 100 ft up and maybe 20' - 25' long.  Listen, they were on a flight pattern almost right above, not in complete uniform but close.  The 3rd or 4th one was right overhead in fact my wife grabbed my arm as I joked that if these are real UFO's one might beam me up and she was deathly afraid that it might. I got to see inside it pretty well.  It looked to me like the outside was opaque (see thru) down the middle inside was a dark (spine or pencil) running the length of it.  Imagine the top 3rd of a Christmas tree looked like the propulsion as it was glowing, mainly orange, red. It looked like it was on file but a controlled fire that never got out of control.  Heck, I did a lot of research and many say it's those Chinese lanterns.  No, waaaay to big and at the end. First 3 or 4 came, than the other 4 about 5 -7 minutes later.  There was also the 9th UFO? that stayed out a distance that never came to close to recognize the color or shape.  You see, I like fairly close to O'Hare and the flight pattern is pretty similar location and we were seeing lights and after a while they would get closer and you could make them out but the 9th UFO? never got too close or on the flight pattern of the regular aircraft. It was close, I mean close enough and closer than the videos I see on you tube for me to see inside and make it out really well.  Funny thing was it was a rather calming experience.  I mean if you were to tell me that I would see a UFO I would normally be afraid and here I was looking at what I think were UFO's and I wasn't scared.  Like I said I went underneath and said ""go ahead and beam me up!""  I just never felt that it was threat to us. I believe it was unmanned?  Not sure if unmanned is right word there?  Anyway, I believe it was just gathering information.((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))Hi Peter,Not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear on 8/20/16 in Chicago. The altitude of the few clouds were at least twice that of the ufo's. I don't know how to triangulate altitude but I do know from just checking google images of pictures from 1000' altitude that that is really close to the height (perhaps less and 800' is probably closer). Our location seeing this was Hermosa Park. If you do a quick google or view of the park we were in the field between the baseball field and the playground. The formation came from the baseball field to the playground which is from West to East (Lake Michigan is due East).I just wish like a computer my memory from this event could be accessed so you could see what I saw.. I did some research after seeing this (after checking to see if I could find other reports about this particular incident) and found this to be the closest thing to what I saw - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY. The only difference was my vantage point. We were probably 3 times closer than his view, right underneath the flight pattern.Crazy thing to me was after researching the internet was seeing so many reports of similar sightings. I would've just brushed these people away myself before this happened as I'm a see it to believe it kind of person but I can tell you I'm a believer now!I really not sure how to contact the local press about something like this but myself or my wife are not afraid to say what we saw.

The sky was clear of clouds and there was a bright moon.As the craft approached us, I grabbed my Iphone to record video and my friend grabbed my binoculars.  He couldn't zero in on the object fast enough to get a good look but I got it on video for the duration of the event.Right away, we both thought it was a drone, but when it traversed such a great distance at a relatively fast speed we were convinced it was not a drone.  There were no aviation lights on the craft, and it was a dark orange in color; it almost had a pearl type glow to it. Meaning the color kind of had a swirl to it.  It was shaped sort of like an egg on it's side.  There was no noise and it appeared to be pretty close and low in the sky although it was difficult to tell with no clouds to judge altitude.My friend who is also an avid sky watcher said it resembled a rocket launch, so we right away started researching any launches for that night and there was none.It wasn't a star, meteor, plane, drone or helicopter.

1294,"UFO Fleet of bright green star-like orbs photographed while traveling across downtown Knoxville.I was exiting a restaurant with a friend on Gay Street on 8/19/16 at 8:49 pm in Knoxville TN.  As soon as we stepped out onto the street, I looked North (with my I-Phone 6 in hand) and I was overwhelmed by the sight of a very strange cloud formation.  It had three plumes jetting out of it and there was a ceiling of another cloud above it.  It was so surreal and I said to my friend, “I’ve never seen anything like that before in my life!”  At that moment, I had a strange feeling that gave me a sense of it being “other worldly” and it gave me an odd looming feeling. (It should be noted that I was and still am, completely sober.)  Anyhow, I started taking photos of this strange cloud and realized that I had it set on “square” photo and then I switched it to “regular” photo after a few shots (just to explain the difference in layout).  My friend was ready to go and stroll Gay Street, so I turned around on my heels and hopped in the street (as I often do) to take more photos of Gay Street looking South towards the Tennessee Theatre and the river.  So I snap, snap, snap, etc. and then hop back on the sidewalk and take a couple more shots after that.During my photo blitz, I was more focused on looking through my phone-camera than I was on looking at the sky, so I didn’t pick up the details that I had shot until I got home (about an hour and a half later).  As I flipped through the evening’s shots, I could clearly see something in the sky of one of the shots and when zooming in, I discovered that I had photographed a Fleet of bright green UFO’s!  Of course, I then took a much closer look at the photos before and after this particular shot and discovered that I had tracked this Fleet coming out of the clouds (near a mountain which is lined with radio towers) and seconds later, they were on the opposite side of the sky over the Tennessee River.  In the next to the last shot, you can see two domed lights on top of the mountain (across the river).  NOTE:   There are no lights on top of this mountain and the lights are not seen before or after the incident.  Then in the last shot, you will notice the same two dome lights lifting off into the sky and there is also an orb-type UFO faintly seen in this shot as well.The last shot was taken out of series at 9:14 pm. (I think I just happened to catch them again while they were “taking off”).  None of my photos before or after this series of Gay Street shots, show anything in the sky, nor specs on the lens, etc.  I still have all these photos on my phone and I am happy to show anybody who would like to see the original shots so you can verify the time, date and that I have not retouched these in any way.  I have only emailed them to myself and saved them to my desktop to put a slide show together which I shared on my FaceBook page.I should also mention that I have had Close Encounters (of several kinds) numerous times throughout my life.  However, this is the first time that I have ever managed to take photographs of the visitors.  Not that it means much to those who don’t know me but I’m a very logical person, a respected professional in my industry (fine art painting) and a “normal” 49 year old mother.  I hope these photos help open some minds on the topic.Also to note:  In one of the photos, the glowing green orb heads towards me and is photographed from about 10 feet from me near the sidewalk.  Also, when I zoomed in on these photos, each of the anomalies appear to have a 6 pointed star-like glow and each have a hue of violet/rose colored aura around them.",Duration:25 minutes,"Location: Knoxville, TN",Occurred : 8/19/2016 20:49  (Entered as : 08/19/2016 20:49),Posted: 8/29/2016,Reported: 8/27/2016 1:07:11 PM 13:07,Shape: Light

1296,"8-10 glowing orange red-ish orbs passing by as if migratingThis was a group or fleet of orange glowing orbs.  I live just outside my hometown Kokomo and Russiaville, Indiana.  I was on my way into work driving from 26 to Dixon road heading north towards Mikes Pizza and the Speedway.  At first I only saw a couple and thought it wasn't anything special because I always am searching the skies and usually find nothing.  There were a few ahead of the rest and at first I thought it was a few of planes, but they had no sound and glides like dancing orange balls.  2 leading and 1 dancing around them.   Have you ever watched how ash off of a campfire floats away off the amber?  This is how the entire group was moving but one of them seemed to enjoy moving back and forth up and down dancing with the rest in this same motion.As I passed Center round heading towards alto the orbs had fallen down a lot to a point where I could see very clear it wasn't any plane or flares.  I called my wife in excitement telling her I had just seen 3 orbs dancing in the sky heading from the west to the east, as if they were coming from Russiaville area.  As I quickly approached Alto road I was still looking around to keep my eyes on them.  This is when I noticed the massive group of about 7-8 more.  They were not in any particular order or formation. I quickly told my wife I would call her back because I had to get some kind of proof of what I was seeing.  I pulled over and got the best video recording of it on my phone.  Had I seen the entire group earlier I would have pulled off the road much earlier when I was closer to them to get a better recording.  They glided in the sky farther away and extremely quick as if they were just passing by and on a mission.  It was truly magnificent to see. In the short video clip, 975 o! f excitement I called them crafts but they weren't.  They were orange red -ish orbs and seemed very peacefully in the air.  This is the second event in Kokomo I have experienced but first time ever getting something caught on camera.  In 2008 and 2013 we had similar glowing orbs flying in the sky as well.When I was underneath them, they seemed to act alive and not like a vehicle of some sort.  My thoughts would be the orbs were entities themselves passing by or through our deminsion or realm.  They glided up and down and moved left to right in a clean soundless dancing motion.  This is why I did not think they were flares or Chinese candles.  They moved too quickly and decisively in an intelligent manor.",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Kokomo, IN",Occurred : 8/19/2016 18:56  (Entered as : 08/19/16 18:56),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/20/2016 7:08:00 PM 19:08,Shape: Circle

As she left, my daughters and I turned around to see a silver oval object hanging in the air.   It was low enough to be very visible.  I could tell this was a rather large object and from where I was standing, it seemed to be hovering above the 710 freeway which is just a few blocks away from our house.  The object hovered silently in the sky for about 5 min. and suddenly went straight up in the air at a super-fast speed.  There was a mist or vapor that came off the object as it sped into the air, this vapor rapidly dissipated, leaving no trail.    It made no sound.  My youngest daughter was actually frightened and I had to calm her down.  My eldest daughter thought it was pretty cool...as did I.

1301,"Green Fireball spotted over Pompano Beach in the Morning.I was opening the garage door at work & spotted a light in the sky that grew in intensity. I've seen shooting stars many times before, so I thought that it would be one.However, it took off really quick & the orb was glowing green, while the tail & the sky around it flashed through different colors rapidly.  Not to mention that it was MUCH bigger than a shooting star.  It was almost similar to a flare being shot off, but it was green (not red), flew in a fast & straight line, and it had a bunch of colors streaming from it.There is a video online of a Green Fireball flying over Poland.  That is very similar to what I saw in almost every detail (even how the head detached from the tail) except for the one I saw had the tail that kept changing colors.I wasn't going to report this, but I saw that there were other reports of a (the?) fireball flying around that same day.I want to include that in 1999, me & my girlfriend witnessed a triangle UFO hovering very close to where we were standing in a parking lot.  DAYS after that spotting, I noticed a strange triangle pattern tattooed into my hand that matched right up to other triangle tattoos that I've seen on other UFO witnesses.

1302,"Fireball looking UFO hovered near us on beach.My boyfriend and I honestly felt crazy,, and were not going to post anything, until we saw a startlingly similar sighting in our town, same area *the beach,* at nearly identical time, August 19th, around 12:50 am and on.We walked down to the beach and sat by the water, we are sitting now and see to our right (about 150 yards away) a white blinking light close to the ground, running uncomfortably fast towards us.  We had our dog, a Doberman, and assumed maybe it was a puppy with a blinking collar for night time.  Regardless, it freaked me out a bit an we ran back to our beach access (approximately 0.3 of a mile).  When we felt we were at the safety of our access and close to our home, we turned around and saw not just one blinking light, but now two.  Sprinting from the shore all the way to the top of the beach, back and forth at insane speed.  The blinking lights are going into the water-about 5 yards, and seem to have no trouble sprinting back and forth without stopping.  At this point, we realized their speed and how the second light came out of nowhere, it could not be dogs.At this point, I was very uneasy and told my boyfriend I would like to go home.  He insisted on watching and figuring it out.  When I told him again I was leaving, the two blinking lights shut off.  After 3-5 seconds of darkness, the lights come back on but now there are more, maybe 5 separate sources of these blinking lights, running quickly from the shore to the top of the beach.We turn around to go home and DIRECTLY in front of us, 100 yards AT MOST, and 3 stories high there is a bright orange/yellow LARGE light (looked like it could have been a plane) until it began rushing towards us and would change speed-when we turned around it was racing towards us but when we saw it, immediately slowed.  It was directly over us at a point and there was a white light in the middle of it reflecting down over us.  We looked where it originally seemed to be speeding from, and there WAS a small smoke trail.  We started screaming and ran back to the street.  We tried understanding what it was, but couldn't.  There was no start or end to the object-it was glowing, it had a glowing aura about it.It made no noise whatsoever.  It was right above us and we hard nothing. Neither of us were intoxicated and we consistently walk the beach at night as we live so close. We have never seen anything like this.When we were on the street, we looked back at the apartment building and could see the object hovering over the beach access where we left.  Literally just hovering.  As we were running home, it would go behind the building so we couldn't see it, but peek back out the same side. It did this 2-3 times and disappeared, not coming back out from the apartment building again.I'm not sure if these are unrelated experiences, but at the time it felt the blinking lights were distraction to turn around and have this terrifying, unidentified object so close to us....

1316,"Orange orb, then 22 minutes later, a blue light that disappeared in <2 seconds.An avid sky-watcher and amateur astronomer, I've seen meteors, fireballs, comets, and satellites, as well as things that are frequently reported as UFOs, such as aircraft, birds, bugs, and advertising lights.  I spend a lot of time sky-watching, and hadn't seen anything unusual in over a year, until last night.At 8:23PM, I noticed a bright glowing orange light a few degrees east of due north and about 20 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a plane, because it seemed to be near Long Beach International Airport, but the color wasn't typical of aircraft lights.  Through my binoculars, it looked slightly vertically elongated, as opposed to round.  I noticed no other lights on it.  I also couldn't bring it into focus and the upper portion was fuzzier than the bottom portion.  It slowly moved upwards and then slightly eastward, and then it moved slightly erratically and quickly faded out without a trace.  Having read numerous reports about the propensity of orange orbs to travel in groups, I watched for more, but no more appeared.Then, at about 8:45 PM, I was looking towards the SSE at a light that was probably a high altitude jet, and in the same general area a bright blue light appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon.

1348,"Red circular object moving quickly, then stops and hovers over Providence, RI, changes colors and then disappears.Around 5:30 this morning, my husband was out in the back yard with our dog, when he began to shout for me to come outside quickly. I worried something was wrong, so I immediately ran outside, as he pointed to the sky.  About a mile away I saw a very prominent red circle or orb like craft.  There could have been a haze around it but unsure if it was my eyes or not.  The orb was definitive and red though.  I observed it and watched it  in the sky as it was hovering.  Then, it very quickly zinged to the right and stopped again.  It turned from red to white, then back to red.  What I couldn't believe was the way it flew to the side and stopped immediately, not a gradual stop or eased stop, but a full on stop, like it hit a barrier and how fast it was moving.  It hovered a minute, then zinged left stopped, and it appeared to gain some elevation as it slowly proceeded to fly to the right and out of view for a few seconds, when I caught a glimpse of it through the houses.  I then observed it zing up into the sky so fast, I couldn't believe it, and it was gone.  I am a well educated professional and I am telling you there is nothing I have ever seen or heard of that:  1.  Is as precise in stopping as that craft was, it defied physics;  2. Could move that fast, and still maintain such control; and 3.  Could maneuver so quietly, no visible propellers or exterior engines were visible and without any vapor trail or exhaust.

Hello, this is to report a multiple sighting of triangular objects that were observed withing 17 mins of each other, location was at private house back yard near Oak Tree Road, Edison, NJ.  Here's the story...With the wash out of the Perseid meteor shower, gave it another chance so set up lawn chairs and waited, saw few streaks but nothing spectacular.....But at approx 4:10 am EDT observed a craft that was directly overhead traveling from south to north, it was shaped like an acute triangle with long sides/thin and had a blue white light on front of it and two rectangular type lights on each side.  The lights were a diff color than the stars and when the craft would go in front of star it would blot it  out ….....I would say this  craft was orbital, for it traveled my field of view in 15-20 secs and was very high in night sky.  Also, it did not shimmer like the stars did, just solid blue/white lights …........Then to my  surprise, spotted another craft of this type a few mins later (17) but it was to east on a south east to north west track, appox 70 degrees  and moving at same clip as prior one..............  And then, another lighted triangle appeared but it was about 6 secs behind this one, having follow same track but as it drew near it acted in HERKY JERKY MANNER, slowing down and speeding up at times....Objects  observed were about size of three pencil erasers held at arms length  , and way up in the sky...........

I looked up and saw about 8 or 9 relatively small crafts arranged in a V formation fly just overhead moving from north to south.  At first glance, I thought it was a flock of geese, but these definitely weren’t birds.  Only about 10 seconds had passed between the time they appeared and the time they were out of sight, so I didn’t get a long enough look to be able to specifically identify the crafts’ shape.  They were something between spherical and cubic, but what caught my attention and ultimately disqualified my first interpretation of it being a flock of geese was the lack of wings.  There were definitely no wings on any of the crafts, nor did I notice any “flapping” movements. They flew together in perfect unison while maintaining the V formation, almost as if they were connected in the air.  Their movements were swift and completely silent.  Geese make enough noise when they fly that most people can tell when their approaching even before they’re in sight. These crafts flew by without even slightly disrupting the air.",Duration:10 seconds,"Location: Northglenn, CO",Occurred : 8/15/2016 23:00  (Entered as : 8/15/16 23:00),Posted: 8/29/2016,Reported: 8/26/2016 10:16:09 AM 10:16,Shape: Formation

The near full moon was out, and very bright. (Therefore, the UFOs I saw had to be very bright).  I suddenly noticed 2 UFO's on the horizon.  They were the color of fire, and looked like comets with very oddly shimmery tales.  They were very close inside the atmosphere, like a plane over the horizon.  They were flying near to one another, side by side like two fighter jets might be, on slightly higher.  They were in the sky for maybe 30 seconds then the lights completely went out.  Not more than a couple minutes, and they reappeared in full intensity, and then soon disappeared once more.Another table was watching dumbfounded.  The waiter came by 10 minutes later and as I was relaying the story to him, the two lights appeared again, this time higher up and closer in towards the coast, and again, with the same intensity and appearance.

We began filming and shortly after shutting the camera off, we completely lost sight of it as though it had disappeared.After this we went to swim nearby, further down West Hollis Street, near the Harley Davidson shop.  For the next 15 minutes, we continuously saw the same thing over and over. Perfectly circular, extremely white, and bright, craft, moving 5 times faster than any plane I've ever seen.  However, one of the crafts, instead of climbing diagonally, shot STRAIGHT UPWARDS.  And vanished.  After this we saw nothing else but it disappeared into thin air.

1374,"Flickering round ball, following flight path of jets.Was lying on my back on a bench at the Oldest House, looking at the clear, blue sky through polarized sun glasses, seeing 4-5 jets/planes passing high overhead on a roughly southwest-to-northeast flight path.

After the planes had passed, I noticed a round object, about 1/4 the apparent size of the planes, with variable brightness and with color flickering from bright orange, to white, traveling at what appeared to be a similar height, speed and trajectory.  I thought it might be a rotating, non-uniform metallic balloon intermittently reflecting the sunlight, but the velocity appeared to be similar to the jets and it seemed to be traveling horizontally, not vertically.

1378,"A glowing white ball of light moving from side-to-side for 25 min.s behind light-colored night clouds.At about 3:30 a.m.( quite early) in the morning on Sunday, August 14th, 2016, I drove out into the suburbs to a dark field in the countryside to try & observe what I thought might be the last opportunity to catch a glimpse of the last meteorites of the recent ""Perseid Meteor Shower.""  As I drove to the spot were I wanted to stop, I looked up towards the light-colored night clouds & immediately noticed what I ""logically"" thought -might- be someone from the ground using a searchlight machine to shine into the clouds in order to attract viewers to something they were advertising.  As I stopped my car & my eyes got a chance to both adjusted to the darkness & focus more sharply, I saw that what I saw was actually seeing was a glowing white ball of light moving slowly & rhythmically from side-to-side behind the slightly translucent, white, night clouds. It consistently took about 7 seconds for the glowing ball to reach each side (i.e., first the left ! side & then the right).  Needless to say, I was totally shocked to see such a phenomenon, as there was -no- beam nor column of light -beneath- the ball, as you would expect if it indeed were (what I originally suspected it was)__ someone using a searchlight from the ground to advertise something.  As I watched this glowing white ball for about 25 minutes, it became unquestionably clear that it was -not- a searchlight & not controlled by any human being.  It seemed to be some kind of self-driven, ""ionized,"" glowing ball that was energized,& that moved with a consistent timing & in a consistent way.  As the translucent light-colored night clouds began to gradually fade away, so did the mysterious, moving, glowing ball of light.  By the way, there were no ""Perseid"" meterorites for me to see that night_ although I witnessed something else instead that was even more amazing to me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1379,"8/14/16 @ 1:56am  Orange glowing ball disappears, re-appeared and disappears again in Vancouver sky.  Total time 1min.I was doing a late night stroll on 8/14/16.  I noticed off to my left an orange/red ball of light in the sky.  It was well above the tree and house lines on the opposite side of the street and there was nothing to obstruct my view.  It was 1:56am and I was looking in southern direction.  Towards Portland, Oregon, from Vancouver, Washington.Right away, I noticed something different about the light.  It was it's glow.  It was like a light orange at the center and grew a bit darker moving from center to outer edges.  Where it was more of a redish color.  There was also a blinking, or some kind of flashing.  It was rhythmic in sequence, but it was of the same color as the orb.  The light did not illuminate any distinguishable features.  The light was large.  Imagine holding a match head at arms length, that's about how big it looked to me.  I would roughly estimate it being 5 to 10 miles away.It was moving in a flat, arc like pattern.  From the west to east, then finally heading south. After it was heading what looked like south, for about 3 seconds.  It grew dim real fast then blinked out of existence.  For a moment, I thought it might be a plane. Because of its flight pattern and the fact that the Portland airport lies just south west from where I saw it.  Yet, there were no other light markers on it.  No green and white flashing lights.  No landing/takeoff lights or the tall tale pattern of said lights.  This glowin, orange ball had no defining mark or any light source.At 1:57 I texted my friend to see if he was awake....nope.At 1:59 it re appeared. This time I had phone in hand and got some video.During it's second run. The light just appeared out of nowhere.  It moved from east to west. Then quickly back in the easterly direction. Where it stopped in mid flight and mid air. It danced around a bit. It popped up, then down, then it jutted to the west and slowly moved back to its original spot.  At this time, it looked as though it was moving south again. Because after a couple of seconds it dimmed in brightness rather fast, then blinked 2 or 3 times like before and gone!  There was no chance of it being a helicopter.  Like the plane, there were no external light markers.  It moved to fast and too random for it to be a helicopter.  Not to mention the whole orange glow as well as it appearing out of nowhere.I have also given thought to its departures. With the whole light dimming, then blinking out. No plane or helicopter could move so fast that you would loose sight of it. Especially one as bright as the ball I witnessed. It would take minutes for it to gradually fade from sgh. This ball went from a big, bright, glowing orb to nothing in 3 seconds.....two times did this.Unfortunately, like all lowlight/nighttime video, it came out not showing much. You can see what looks like a star, a white dwarf. The camera could not pick up its orange glow and without it, it was considerably smaller. Yet, it was much larger and brighter than the North Star. But the camera was having a hard time focusing on it.Something else I noticed,  it was the difference in shape between what I saw with the naked eye and what the camera was able to detect. With the naked eye, the object (or shape of the glow if you will) was not necessarily round. It was more cylindrical, a shape more like a soda can. There was no source to the glow, nor did that glow cast anylight upon itself. That being said, any defining details like silhouette, shadows, outlines, etc; were not present. I have no explanation for the shape it had with what I just said. It just had one.Now, looking through the eye of a camera, you see a perfectly round object. It was bright white in color. Not pure white, but a few shades off. It also flickered like a star. I can't be sure what was causing the flicker. Sometimes it looked like something on the object was pulsating. Sometimes it looked like it could be distortion caused by heat or gasses in the atmosphere.I have described this sighting the best I could. I have mulled over it for a bit , let it sink into my brain, chewed on it for a while and analyzed it from every angle.  I tend to believe nothing of what I hear and only half of what I see.  I have tried to debunk the video the best I could.  I have ruled out helicopters and any fixed wing aircraft.  A drone of sorts is possible, but unlikely. I hope this information is helpful.

(time around 7:10/7:11 pm)  I see something shining in between the clouds (in the direction of the sunset), but with a shape that does not appear to be natural at all.  I could see the exhaust glowing on the left side of what appear to be a huge ufo, an under glowing too, and over it what appear to be like a city over it, picture when you see the top of a navy carrier, that’s what it look like on the top of the huge ufo.  I was driving and over a bridge so I couldn’t stop to see it without risking to be part of a car accident.  I pull out my phone, while driving, and tried to take a picture, but I could not get it. I did got the time which is enough giving the facts.  Now, before I get call crazy or whatever, I want to state clearly that the whole structure was not visible, the only parts visible where the ones I describe before, the exhaust on the left side and under and the shining of the sun on the top structure.  If this is actually a ufo, it was extremely big and most probably was inside the atmosphere because I guess the reflection effect is not the same if you are in space.  But I don’t know, I am not a weather expert.I want to add, today was a very strange day weather wise.  It was full of clouds that looked like columns, it wasn’t raining but the sky was full of electrical activity.  I am completely sure that if this was an UFO there is no way, no way, the radars would miss it, it was just to enormous.

It was silver in color and reflected the sun like chrome.  It appeared to just hover and then slowly glide through the air.  There was no visible exhaust and no sound noticed.  No lighting on the vessel was observed.I thought to myself, “I need to stop and video this.”  I looked to my right to see if the right lane was clear so I could pull to the side of the road.  I looked back up and the vessel had vanished.

I was laying on the ground on my back, and I had two friends on the bench and the others were just standing around at the time. my friend was saying there was this super bright light that was rising across the lake.  I got off the ground to see what she was talking about, because she was trying to figure out if it was actually rising or if it was a meteor or what. so we all started watching this bright light and at first it kind of looked like it could belong to a tower or something... but then it started rising way more over the trees... same size same brightness... and we were just like what is that... and then it start! ed coming toward us...like it all of a sudden was hovering over the middle of the lake it came from being the bright light rising then all of sudden was right over the lake:..

1438,"A large black triangle with three lights that hovered around us for over 2 hours. A solid object that made no sound.My daughter and I went out to view the Perseid Meteor Shower late on Thursday, August 11, at a small park in Rochester N.H., and while we were looking overhead toward the South we spotted a small light moving slowly in all directions.  As we watched we realized it wasn’t moving away from us.  After a few minutes we realized it was shaped like a triangle with a bright light toward the front and two dimmer, green-tinted lights in the back.  We also noticed that there were very faint green lines forming the triangle and connecting the three dots.  It was a solid object and the lights never changed distances from one another.The movement did not resemble a helicopter, airplane, satellite, drone or anything we had ever seen fly in the area before.  It made no noise that we could hear and it clearly had nothing to do with the meteor shower. It in no way looked like a shooting star.  Sometimes it moved quickly to the left or right.  Sometimes it moved forward in the direction of the brightest light and then backed away in the direction of the two green lights.  However, it always remained above us with no real pattern of movement.We were in an open field surrounded by trees and it remained above the open area from 11:45 p.m. on Aug. 11, and we left the scene on Aug. 12 at 1:57 a.m.At one point it seemed to not only move toward the spot where we were sitting, but down towards us.  It then quickly backed away again to its original spot in the sky.While it did move some distance, it never left our sight and was almost always directly above our heads.I made phone calls to the Pease Air Force base nearby and asked them to look to see if they saw anything on radar or any other equipment.  However, they said they could only see flight plans and transponders.  The man on the phone said he would look into our sighting further.We also called the Rochester Police Department and they responded with three vehicles.  The officers observed our UFO and somewhat laughed it off, but nicely.  Both the police officers and the man from the Pease Air Force Base wondered if it might be a drone, but I do not know of any drones that are solid, triangular with three lights.  It flew in so many directions for such a long period of time and made no noise of any kind.  In any event, our sighting was documented by an airport and the local police.Through the entire event the object never moved very quickly, but it did change speeds and stop and start again.My daughter noticed that there was a grey coloring in the solid area between the lights.  She also so on the side of the triangle lights, smaller rectangular lights separated almost like windows.This was the first UFO sighting that either of us has ever experienced. We saw no evidence of aliens. All we saw was the object itself.From what the police told me later, they had many calls from other citizens who saw the ufo and one called this national reporting hotline as well.The police also said that Rochester has no drones nor does the New Hampshire State Police.  They also said that the military would have informed them of any surveillance going on in the city.  They had  no military notifications that night.((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))Here are two of our pictures...Only the bright light in the front of the triangle was visible on the phone camera picture but there it is. We have other pictures but they all look similar. We tried taking video and I'll look at those next as well. Here are the two pictures we managed to get.

From what my daughter said you  may not have received it.  The written report that you received, while it was happening, was hers.  She said it was mine because she was embarrassed to put her name on anything.  I'm going to send it in this e-mail with an attached microsoft word document as well.  ((NUFORCE Note:  Witness alludes to report which appears above.  PD))((END ADDENDUM #2))((ADDENDUM #3 FROM WITNESS))We first saw it on Aug. 11 at 11:45 p.m. and kept on watching it until almost 2 a.m. on Aug. 12.  If it makes it easier we saw it for more time on Aug. 12.  Hope this helps.((END ADDENDUM #3))((ADDENDUM #4 FROM WITNESS))I'm really glad to help.  I've never dreamed of seeing anything so weird in my life and I want to know what others think of it.  The thing that strikes me most is that I never heard of a black triangle up to our sighting.  I have since done a lof of research and see they have been around a long long time, before any drones were in the hands of the public.  I truly don't believe that huge triangle was a citizen's drone.  It was something much more.  It was just too big and too quiet.  I saw a video from Concord, NH, with a triangle that was similar to ours, but it was taken in daytime.  There have been so many of these sightings in NH and the East Coast.  Why is that?  Very very interesting and very very strange.((END ADDENDUM))((ADDENDUM #5 FROM WITNESS))It was much larger than the moon in the sky above us.  To me it seemed as big as a football field, maybe a few football fields, high in the sky and way above the trees.  It flew higher than the small planes.  It dwarfed the small planes that flew around us all night.  As it hovered over us, we got very nervous, even scared, as it moved lower towards us, almost like we feared it was going to fall on us.  My daughter was making strange noises for a short portion of the 2 hours we saw it.  I also remember my heart racing a few times and my hands were trembling like I had too much caffeine?  My voice was trembling when I talked to you on the hotline, and it was hard to catch my breath.  I had a sick feeling in my stomach, but I was so excited to see it at the same time.  She wanted to leave but I wouldn't go.  I couldn't take my eyes off the thing.  I also forgot to mention that at the end it did move out of the area very slowly to the North and out of our view.  The police saw the tail end of it all.  Actually it seemed to move away more directly when the police cars arrived in the parking lot with their headlights and flashlights aimed at the object.

1450,"Flying wing spotted over SeaTac Airport at night.I work at SeaTac Airport and was working on a jetbridge around 10 pm.  While I was looking skyward to see some equipment, a moving object caught my eye.  It appeared to be a flying wing marked on the underside with 4 sharp-angled chevrons with contrasting shading.  It was a VERY dark object, with no illumination at all.  It was travelling due south at a consistent speed.  There appeared to be no organic ancillary movement like a bird would demonstrate; it definitely moved with mechanical fluidity.I could not determine with any certainty the size, elevation, or speed of the object due to the lack of visual scale cues.  It was in my field of vision for only about 10 or 15 seconds after which I could no longer detect it in the dark sky.

1461,"Orange color oval with light on top and many lights on the bottom very distant through a telescope.UFO report of sighting 8-11-16.  The purpose of this report is to identify objects that I have seen through my telescope, and not to claim a sighting of extraterrestrial aircraft.On August 11, 2016, at 8:10 pm I observed a bright spot in the sky with my naked eye that was obviously not a star as the stars were not visible this early in the evening.  After a few minutes I realized what I was seeing was not something I have seen before so I shot a picture and a short video with my cell phone and got my wife to come outside to have a look also.Using a 7x35 binocular I was able to resolve the object into a disc shape but no other detail was visible.  I set up my C-8 Celestron telescope to have a better look.  The object resolved into an orange color object that was oval shape, had a flashing light on top, was rimmed with what appeared to be many lights around the circumference of the bottom side that were dimmer than the light on top, and seemed translucent like a fabric.After a few minutes of observing, I attached a video camera to the telescope and recorded a few minutes of video in two recordings.  After bumping my telescope I was not able to find the object again as it was getting farther away and dimmer during the observation.The video capture settings, frame rate at .844 per sec. is to slow to stop movement so there is some motion blur in the images but enough detail to see structure of the object.  The orange color had faded to whitish purple by the time I got the video recording.  I do not see the lights that were around the bottom of the object in the video image that I saw through the eyepiece of the telescope.The sighting lasted from 8:10 pm to 8:53 pm about 43 minutes until I lost sight of it.  The direction of travel was southeast, and the object got smaller by about half and was viewed by me and my wife, before I went to video capture.My telescope was hastily set up and there were no stars to polar align the mount so the tracking is off a little with respect to the stars.  The tracking motor is running at sidereal rate and I used the manual slow motion controls to center the object when it ran out of the field of view.  I have been using this telescope for 18 years and this camera for only a few times.  I am experienced with deep sky astrophotography with several camera types and several telescope types for 17 years.Technical information:  Telescope, Celestron C-8 telescope, 200mm mirror f/10 with f/3.3 focal reducer.

1466,"Large Square flying object constantly rotating while flying or hovering, with lights, and no sounds from it.Hello:  I wasn't sure where to report what 5 of us witnessed yesterday evening.At approx. 7:10pm, my wife and I were out on our front patio deck with our 3 nieces.  We had taken 2 pairs of binoculars out with us, as we watch the hikers, and parasailers climb, and jump off the huge rock mountain here named ""The Chief"".We had watched 3 separate para-sailers jump from the top of the mountain.  Our patio deck faces 3 directions, south, west, and north.As we had been watching the para-sailers, just viewing with my eyes, my oldest niece watching through one pair of binoculars, and my wife and other nieces see it by eyesight as well, we saw a large darker shadowy object flying very quickly across the top of the large rock mountain.  It moved like nothing I have ever witnessed.  I grabbed the Bushnell binoculars and zoomed in on this flying object.  At this point, my 7 year old niece was already crying, and very scared.  Our other 2 nieces are younger and probably aren't as aware of flying objects.  My wife had then used the binoculars that my niece had, and she watched this flying object as well.  We both had a clear approx. 30-second view through binoculars at this flying square object.  It came in fast from the south, we spotted it once it cleared the tall tree line across our road.  As it came closer, the colors started to clear on it.  This flying object constantly rotated around, although it was square in shape.  It rotated around both in flying mode, and in hovering mode.  It hovered above my wife and I for about 10 seconds at maybe 3/4 to 1 mile from us.  It continuously rotated.  As the colors and shape appeared in the binoculars, the main square body was a tan/dark to mid grey color.  Shape, as I'm a Certified Welder/Fabricator, picture 3 large steel shipping containers set side by side tightly, and welded together.  It was square and 1/4 as deep as it was long and wide.  It clearly had 3 large circular portal areas equally spaced along all 4 sides, not the top or bottom, and on all 4 sides, there were 3 portals.  It had a total of 12 portals.  I sketched it last night, and as I looked at my diagram trying to figure out how anything square could fly completely smooth, and horizontal, rotate constantly, and can stop and hover, while still  rotating, it appears to me, as if the 3 portals along all 4 sides as they were blue/grey in color, compared to the Tan/Dark Grey main body, would possibly be a propu! lsion system.  If all 12 portals could rotate a propulsion drive in a 360 degree movement, simliar to a Harrier jet, then yes, I can see how a square object could fly and hover.  I'm a Licenced Automotive Technician and Certified Welder/Fabricator by trade here, and I'm an avid custom car, truck, and motorcycle enthusiast, so I know almost every single mechanical sound on this planet.  The rotating square object made no noises.  We could hear the hikers and para-sailers talking on the mountain side, but nothing from this square flying object.  I and my wife witnessed it, it then started to move north again, and I watched it until the roofline made me run from the front to the back deck in 3 seconds, but on the back deck, it had completely disappeared, and we have a long, large view up the valley, and of the mountains off our back deck.

Then behind my curtains.  I thought that did not seem like a helicopter or plane.  I got up and watched it then start to bob up slowing in a straight line.  It had lights that rotated in a circler motion and disapeared and then would restart cycle.  It fired off laser dotted lights in green.  Flickering.  Not solid lined.  Almost flashing.  Then I looked over to right to see if there were possibly more and there was another identical lights.  It bobbed in same place.  Every once it would light up from behind and it seemed to be invisible, but it matched the sky.  It was huge.  I looked back over to first one I saw again and I noticed it was huge also.  Both bottoms were facing me.  Tilting up but jus! t bobbing slightly.  I watched for about 45 minutes.  They never disapeared.

1490,"Bright flashing light too fast to be anything but a ufo following me in my truckI came over a rolling hill with a few trees directly ahead of me and I saw a bright flashing light in the shape of a circle just beyond the trees and as the road curved a noticed that the bright flashing light did not go as the road did it stayed in the pretty much the same spot through my windshield even though I had changed direction maybe 30 degrees.  That's when I knew that it was moving at the same speed as my truck.  And then it was on the other side of my truck almost as if it was pinned on me, for the next few minutes it traveled through rolling hills switching sides being in the front and then gone and then I'm the rear. It was a bright white light that flashed in roughly 1-2 seconds segments.  And it appeared to be only one, but I took a video through my side mirror and you can see the flashes moving in a direction and then the next flash it was well behind that, faster than any man made machine could possibly have done.  This occurrence also happened after I was at a rest stop and felt my uhaul truck swaying and I look at the long grass and trees and there was minimal wind it would take gusts to rock it the way it was rocking while the truck was not turned on.  I didn't think anything of it, but I felt that there was someone in the back and went an opened the back gate and even asked whoever was in there to please get out that it was not safe to ride with all the furniture.  Saw and heard nothing.  Got back into the cab and after a short time the rocking proceeded.  I banged on the back of the truck and said at least ride up here with me I have potato chips I can share, and to keep me company, as I was just joking not thinking anyone was in there but to take my mind off of it cuz it was making me paranoid.  Well, after the strange encounter with the flashing light that followed me for a good 5-10 miles it slowly disappeared into the distance very high in the air.  I got out to check the back again and the lights on the outside ! of the truck were flickering, just enough for me to notice as ! the were not flickering before the flashing unknown object laid before me.  I fell asleep in the truck an hour down the road and proceeded to call it hallucinations for the exhaustion from moving all day and driving all night.  That evening after work, I was telling someone about my hallucinations and how real it seemed and how paranoia can really mess with someone's head, when I remembered I took 2 short videos of the occurrence in a quick manner and had not looked at them yet.  Expecting not to see anything, it terrified me to see the light as I had seen it the night before on that very dark country highway leading into Colfax, Washington, and I even called my wife during the whole thing to tell her how scared I was and asking why is this light following me.  She even thought I was just tripping.   Well after I saw the videos I have never been more scared to be outside after dark, it really puzzled me on how real this was and how much it seemed to be a fantasy in a made up story book.

This went on for maybe 2-4 seconds until it snapped back into its straight line steady pace only this time going back from the direction it came from (west to east) and faded away shortly after that.This is without a doubt the first time in my life where I would confidently say that I had seen a UFO of some kind, based simply on the movement of the object.

1493,"saw what sounded like a helicopter but looked so wrong once, and then two more times during a meteor showerI had just gotten home from a day with my family.  My uber driver told me to look out for a meteor shower from midnight till six. I was standing outside smoking a cigarette in my driveway when I heard a strange sound. It was almost like a helicopter blade, but it sounded fake.A few minutes later, I saw the UFO. it flew low to the ground from my right side, making an arc all the way around my horizon and disappearing out of view behind the school across the street from my house.  The craft looked strange, with piercing white lights on it and one red light at the front.  The whole thing was lit with an orangeish hue.I pulled out my phone to record this first incident.  I texted my best friend who is a fellow believer and told him I'd send him the video-only to discover the video was completely gone.  There was no trace of me recording even though I had clearly done so.Freaked out, I sit on the curb on my driveway and watch the sky.  A shooting star appears and flies right into the spot I saw the craft disappear from view.  I try to calm down and I make a wish as one is supposed to do.  I'm sitting there watching the sky closely and, texting my friend. I get the strange feeling I am being watched so I stand up and shout ""I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE THERE.""  Five minutes pass and I see the craft again (possibly a separate UFO of the same kind).  I am so frightened this time, not only because it has reappeared but because it seemed to have heard me.  It comes from the same direction I saw the first ship, but takes a slightly less direct route.  It makes no sound this time.Again, I try to record it with my phone.  This time, my phone actually goes completely dead out of nowhere.  The craft lazily disappears out of view, the same way the other one did.I sit down again and begin to shake.  My heart is racing and I'm scared for my life and my sanity.  I keep watching the sky only to see four or maybe five shooting stars all in the same area I saw the UFO's.  Just as I'm about to go inside and charge my phone and grab another cigarette, a third craft appears.  This time, it's coming from the left of me, and it seems closer than before.The craft appears to have a rotating circle of white lights that almost look like stars. The orange hue is very prevalent and I can clearly make out the shape...  It's almost like a ""cigar"" with lights.  I watch the craft fly towards the meteor shower, make a right turn, and then turn into a single red light.  It was almost as if it was cloaked.My friend arrives on the scene shortly after that.  Scared shitless, we sit in my driveway and watch the sky.  My friend points out a very skinny cloud on an otherwise clear night that follows the path I saw the first craft take.  We don't see anything else for a long time, until I notice a star that is blinking and changing colors, and even moving slightly.  My friend and I grab my camera and walk a few blocks, using the camera to zoom in on it.  We eventually go back to my place and I can tell the inadvertent doubt has set in for my friend.  ""Maybe it's just a star, man.""  After all the things I saw last night, I can't be so sure.

Last night (08/09/2016) I lay in my bed watching Netflix as my fiancee goes to open the front door for his friend.  After a short while, they both call my name, screaming.  The way that they were yelling made me think my cat had run into the street and got hit or something.  I jumped up and ran outside, only to find that his friend saw orange orbs in the sky.  At first, I was calm, and I replied, “Oh, I see these all the time I told you ufo are real...

She was so frightened that she left.  My fiancee decided that we needed to record this, so he went inside to look for my real camera.

The orbs appear from nowhere low in the sky and slowly floated up over the clouds.

Once in this form, they floated across the sky towards us which was north to joy from Dearborn.  They appeared to glide across the sky, and they were silent.  Once directly over my hear I could see two dark gray circles on the bottom of the craft spinning.  Once they got just across Joy Rd almost to Chicago on Central, they began to lower they turned dark grayish black and dropped down from the sky to the ground.At that point, I was crying and panicking because I never saw them do that before, and they seemed to be trying to be invisible, and I was terrified, so I ran into the house crying.

I exited the vehicle and glanced over the top of my house to the north...I always do this when I come home from work.  I do not know why.  I live in a pretty dense neighborhood (my lot is .18 of an acre), but being a weeknight it was quiet..no dogs barking, no people out so pretty typical.I live in the flight path of two airports, one that houses mostly business jets as well as recreational aircraft; the other regional jets to international flyers.  I also am subject to the hospital emergency helicopter, aka LifeStar, from time to time and also grew up in the flight path of a military base and get buzzed by the Met Life blimp once a year due to a PGA Golf Tournament that is run a few towns over, so I am pretty familiar with what I should and should NOT be hearing above my head.Like I said, I exited the vehicle and glanced above my house to the north.  My routine.  I was stopped short because I heard something that didn't sound right.  It was a low steady frequency with absolutely ZERO movement to it.  It did not sound mechanical.  I focused my eyes to where it was coming from.  Then up and above my house and over the tops of the trees this massive vessel/craft/ship appeared, strong and steady.It was a long, blunt triangle shape.  Think of a triangle with the tip cut off.  On each of the 4 points there was a steady bright white light I took to be the indicator lights.  Between the back 2 white indicator lights, there was a big bright red light that blinked, not fast..slow and steady.  On the blunt tip between those 2 indicator lights there was what seemed like a wall of lights that only shone straight ahead...like headlights per say.  This ship was either very low or very big.

1515,"Odd ship that changed shapes, then back to original round shape, possible lights on it.My niece called me from Nampa, Idaho, and asked me if I could go outside and see if I could see what she was seeing in the sky,  I live in Boise, Idaho, approximately 20 miles away.  I went out in the backyard and looked toward the southwest, and it only took me a minute or two to spot it.

1516,"Rotating circular object with antennaeOn August 8th, around 17:30MT, I glanced up towards the tops of our popular trees and noticed, what I thought to be a small white ball of spider web hanging from the trees, suspended by the strong breeze, until I realized it was not moving, as it should have been, since the trees were.  I could not determine what it was I was looking at-it was simply a very small white dot against the bright blue, sunlit sky.I brought out binoculars and thru them could tell that this mystery dot was an object much farther away than the tops of the trees.  But even through binoculars it was still just an odd white circle.  I then brought out my 8-inch telescope and for the first time in my life a “mystery object” stayed exactly where it was while I sighted in on it instead of disappearing to let me ponder what I’d seen.  When I popped in my 40mm eyepiece, I was shocked at the view. It was like nothing I’d seen before.  The object looked like the protective grille of a fan, with highly reflective, or independently lit spines, radiating outward in an arc.  Inside the fan grille shape was what looked like a bowl tipped sideways.  Protruding from where one end of the bowl met the grille, there appeared to be antennae of some sort. As I watched I became aware that this object was slowly rotating, placing the antennae away from me so I could not see it, and then bringing it back into my view.  As it rotated, it also presented me a view that brightly reflected an “S” shape within the grille.  It also started to slowly move across my field of view in the eyepiece but I was easily able to follow it.I called my aunt in Boise, who lives near the foothills on the northeast side of town, and asked her to try to spot this thing, and she was able to immediately, but there were a few thin clouds over her area, clouds that were extremely low on the horizon for me as I faced northeast, watching this object continue to rotate and pick up a small amount of forward speed.  It was still visible, though growing smaller and appeared to slow its rotation when I quit watching…  Thankfully I’d snapped several fairly detailed pictures with my cell phone and then with a digital camera, by holding both, individually, up to the eyepiece of my telescope. I even took a few video clips that are of decent quality.I was so excited to see this object that as soon as I had sighted in on it and realized it was not something common, I called your hotline and made a brief report while the sighting was occurring.Last night, my aunt and I tried to identify what we might have seen, trying to debunk our own sighting, but we could not. The closest thing we could compare this odd object to was a Loon Balloon, but both of us agree that was not what we had seen.  Our object was stationary for quite a long time overhead when I first noticed it, but rotating very slowly and the appendage that appeared to be antennae was solidly affixed so that it was able to be suspended horizontally as the rotation continued, and did not hang from below.  When it began to move it was following a fixed path in the sky,  It appeared to be controlled in some intelligent way, until it reached an area northeast of Boise then it began to shift more to the north.What is also of extreme interest is that the pictures my aunt took with her phone depict more than one object-or this same object was able to change its shape-not something I had been aware of but I had taken my eyes off it several times...  But I will let her share that part of the story within her own report.",Duration:>1 hour,"Location: Nampa, ID",Occurred : 8/8/2016 17:30  (Entered as : 08/08/2016 17:30),Posted: 8/16/2016,Reported: 8/9/2016 7:15:26 PM 19:15,Shape: Circle

1528,"Flying bright orbs that flew around in a tight area like firefiliesSo when the Packer game got canceled last night, I decided to take a drive around the back roads with my friend.  Took a little 2 hour drive and on the way home, Utica was having their Utica Fest, and we drove through it.  We drove down 106 and got onto Hillside Road, and my friend said he saw the firework show from Utica going on in the distance.  So I decided to take Aarback Road to Highway 73.  I parked the car 30 feet away from the intersection of Arback Road and Hwy 73.  My friend and I got out of the walked up to the intersection.  So we were looking North West towards Utica and it's 4 miles away from our location.  It is not that impressive watching a fireworks show from that faraway.  So we were watching the show and towards the finally a very bright meteor streaked over our heads from the Eastern sky to the South Western sky.  Then about 2-3 minutes later in the same South Western part of the sky- in the same area or direction of where the meteorite traveled to! - just above the horizon what looked like it was over 40 miles away from us- there were these weird lights that what looked like welding sparks falling very slowly from the sky.  I told my friends it's probably just pieces of the meteorite falling to Earth.  Well here is where it gets weird!  Those sparks just stop in midair and then they started to move back upwards again and then start to zip around in tight circles like fireflies.  After a few minutes of doing that, they came together to make one very bright orb in the sky.  After about 20 seconds, they separated and dance around again, still at the same height, not lowering or rising in the shy just above the horizon.  I told my friend to get out his phone to capture this.  Three minutes goes by and they came together yet again to form the bright orb, but only this time it wasn't as bright as the first time they did it.  It was visible for maybe 15-20 seconds and then it broke up again.  The sparks then looked like they were forming an elongated tube but eventually they turned back into the in! dividual sparks and then vanished from the sky.  My friend got the orb thing on his phone, but it's not very clear video.  I wish I had my camera, because I could have used the telephoto lens on my camera. I started to rationalize that maybe it was a squadron of F-16's with their engines making the spark-like lights and they we were just maneuvering around and maybe the bright orb that we saw was one of the F-16's was using it's afterburner.

1545,"Right in the middle Vega and Arcturus was a bright circular light that looked like a planet but disappeared after only 20 minutes.This even took place August 6, 2016, at around 9:30 PM, just before dusk turned into night in Boise, Idaho.  It was a beautiful evening, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  Mars and Saturn were visible in the southwest skies, along with Jupiter in the west, just below and to the right, of the crescent moon.  Vega and Arcturus were barely visible and directly above of us.  Right in the middle of those two stars was what I thought was Venus.  My wife was nearby and I showed her what I thought was a cool looking planet.  That’s how bright this circle in the dusk sky was and it looked like it was reflecting back the Suns light just like Venus does.  She told me, “Go get your phone and use your Sky app and see if it’s Venus for sure.”  I observed this for about 10-15 minutes and the object was STATIONARY the entire time and it appeared to be in outer space and not in our atmosphere.  I went inside and got my phone and when I came back outside and looked up the object was gone!  Naturally!  So in any event, I still fired up my Google Sky app pointed it up where the object was and that’s when I found out that Venus was on the horizon in the western sky and I just couldn’t see it because the tree tops were obstructing the view.  I’m VERY certain this wasn’t an unusually bright star that only appeared in the sky for about 20 minutes.  If this was a satellite, then it was as big or bigger than the ISS (which I have seen dozens of times flying overhead west to east) and it had some form of exotic propulsion system, or maybe the solar arrays changed location and were no longer reflecting back the light, rendering the object invisible, I don’t know.  This being my 4th UFO sighting tripped me out big time because i! f this was some type of UFO then it was absolutely gigantic, like maybe a huge mother ship.

1549,"Shiny daytime ufo over nampa idaho 08/06/2016Well before dark but after sundown a bright light appeared almost directly overhead.  It was smallish and circular only a few degrees SE from directly overhead.  It was the size of Jupiter, as seen at night lately.  The person who pointed it out to me asked me what it was, so I grabbed a pair of binoculars and braced against the swingset and had a much better look at the anomaly.  In the binoculars it was still quite small but I could see a much higher level of detail.  It was perfectly circular with what appeared to be an indentation in the center and a horizontal darker patch running across the circle.  I grabbed my hunting rifle to see it at a higher magnification and could see a much more detailed view.  It appeared to be a plate shaped disk with two proportionately large tubular curved pieces above and below the darker horizontal line which now with the higher magnification seemed to be some type of structure running across the center indentation.  I called my neighbor and he stepped out and looked at it for a while with my rifle and then he went in and got one of his own and continued looking at it.  At this point, I called kivi a local tv station and told them about what I was looking at and asked if they would point a camera at it.

1550,"Bright orb viewed in twilight and night sky over Meridian/Nampa, Idaho for nearly an hour.On August 6th, 2016, I was in attendance at the stock car races at Meridian Speedway in Meridian, Idaho.  The lady seated next to me and I had been talking about my line of work as a pilot, and she began to put a couple of eye drops in her eye.  As she looked up, she said, “Oh, and there’s an airplane now.”  I, too, looked up and immediately noticed what she was looking at was most definitely not an aircraft of any kind.At first glance, the object appeared to be directly overhead the speedway at an altitude of approximately ten to fifteen thousand feet AGL (above ground level).  The object was quite bright in the evening sky.  The object was VERY slowly moving west.  The object’s shape was hard to decipher, but it was definitely not perfectly circular.  The shape was more oblong than anything, or perhaps even cylindrical shaped.  I noticed other people in attendance at the speedway were beginning to watch the object as more people had their heads turned.  I kept a keen eye on the object and noticed that it’s almost imperceptible movement began to slow after a few minutes.  The object moved from directly overhead Meridian, Idaho, to directly over what appeared to be Nampa, Idaho, in the span of fifteen minutes.  During the first few minutes of observation, my guess was that the object was a weather balloon.  Weather balloons are launched over the Treasure Valley twice daily from the National Weather Service station in Boise, Idaho.  I looked at my watch and discovered that the last weather balloon was launched over two hours ago.  The object never decreased in size during the entire hour that I watched it, indicating to me that this was definitely not a weather balloon.  Weather balloons decrease in relative size from the naked eye as they gain altitude.  This object was not gaining altitude and was remaining the same size during the entire viewing.  The object appeared to be emitting its own light, and as the sun set and the other stars and planets became visible the object appeared to become much more red in color.The lady seated next to me was quite interested in the object and tried taking numerous photos of the object with her iphone, but none of the images showed anything of merit. After about 45 minutes of watching the object the lady seated next to me decided to go to her car and view the object with a pair of binoculars she had in her car.  She left and I last viewed the object almost an hour after first witnessing the object.  I looked up again a couple minutes later and the object was gone.  The lady returned a few minutes later looking rather flustered and stated that she was at her car viewing the object with her binoculars, looking directly at the red orb, when in vanished into thin air.I know this was not an aircraft, as I’m a full-time pilot, and I’m quite aware of what aircraft of all types look like in the sky.  This object was not a weather balloon, drone, or blimp of any kind.  The object emitted a very bright light in the evening sky and emitted a very bright red/orange glow after sunset.  The peculiar shape of the object and the odd movement of the object are what baffle me.I know dozens of other people at the speedway that night witnessed the object, so hopefully they too will write reports.I first witnessed the object at 20:17 and last saw the object at 21:13 local time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was curious how one end of both rainbows started right outside the restaurant on the road, meters from where we were.  The UFO was oval and white and was there for a few seconds only.((NUFORC Note:  The photo shows an object, which appears to be almost transparent, or diaphonous.

I first saw the object while the car was driving on Glendale Blvd and continued to watch it off and on as we drove onto Hyperion.  The object was solid black, triangular shaped, and seemed to fade into what looked like a grainy smoke, and then became very solid and metallic looking again.  It was low in the horizon just above the tree tops in the distance.  I told the taxi driver about it, but because he was driving in traffic, he could not stop to take a look at it.

1558,"Basketball sized dull reddish orange Orb flew decidedly around tree tops and past my 3rd story apartment balcony.My husband and I spend most of our evenings on our apartment porch.  We are on the corner of the 3rd story and face an open field next to our apartment complex.  We're the only ones with this amount of an amazingly open field view at this complex.  Though it's an open field, it is outlined with trees, some of which are close to our porch.  From the porch of my 3rd story apt about 20-30 ft out from me, just above a tree top, I looked up and out just in time to randomly see a dull orange/red orb come over and around a tree top right in front of me.  I didn't sense it, it made no sound  at all, and even though it glowed orange and reddish orange it didn't cast enough light to shine on to anything.  So with that being said if I hadn't just looked out at the view in front of me at that exact moment, I would have never seen it, I would have never known it was there at all.  It moved fast and direct.  Staying just inches above the tree tops, moving decidedly around the tree! tops.  Too fast, too silent and too weird of a light to be a drone, too close and too small to be mistaken for a plane or helicopter.  A big storm was brewing in the next town over (Broken Arrow/Tulsa) that we could easily see amazing lightening take place from, but the weather was very calm and pleasant where we were.  Almost no wind or noise, just a calm night.  By the time I registered what I was seeing and started to say, ""Wow look at…,"" to my husband, it was gone without a trace.  The whole thing took place in under 10 seconds, my husband was lighting his cigarette while this was taken place and there for didn't see anything.  The weirdest thing of all, it didn't fly away, shoot off or land.  As soon as I made a sound to form the words Wow, it was that exact moment, mid-flight past our porch it just vanished! Gone. Not up, not down, not hiding... light off in the blink of an eye, no traces left, gone. Poof.Next day I had a strange, realistic dream (occurrence?) during a midday nap.  I felt the need to wake and check on my kids but when I tried to sit up and roll over I felt drugged, no strength, couldn't hardly move or open my eyes.  I managed a weird flop and roll over, tried to say my daughters name but it sounded sluggish to my own ears.  I managed to open my eyes just enough to be blinded by a very direct bright pin point of a light.  I asked my husband later that day if he had come home from work on lunch and for some weird reason shined his phones flashlight in my face or something haha, but he said no definitely not.  All I know is I must have immediately gone into a deep sleep and woke what felt like only 5 to 10 minutes later but I can not be sure.  Everything seemed fine in the house when I did get up, my daughter was asleep on the couch and my son was in his room on the xbox.I went outside to my porch to just take a minute and reflect, thats when I noticed a wicked bad bruise on my left calf muscle with no explanation as to when or how I acquired it.  A day or two later a solid white perfect circle appeared in the bruise, next day another perfect circle appeared right next to the first one;  Both in the middle of the bruise.  That's also when I noticed there were solid pea sized hard lumps.  One under each white circle in the middle of this purple, blue, green, yellow bruise.  A few days later the circles became outlined in perfect red lines that almost resemble spider veins but much softer, smaller and lighter and in an almost honeycomb shape.  The bruises and red lines are gone now, but the hard mass is still very much there.  Also it stopped feeling like two individual pea sized knots and started feeling more like the size and shape of just one Tylenol pill.To sum it up: Softball/basketball sized orb, dull reddish orange glowing orb, flew around a tree top and past me on my 3rd story apartment porch.  When my presence was made known by me attempting to alert my husband of the orb, it blinked out of sight.Next day I had a very strange nap that I felt I couldn't wake up from and when I tried I can barley recall a bright pinpointed light shine in my eyes while I was in bed in my room and I fell back to sleep.Later same day, I found a big bruise on my inner left calf muscle that was shaped like a dogs paw print.  One big bruise with 3 medium to small bruises just above the big bruise.  Bruise was wicked, dark purple, blue, green, yellows and next day a small white perfect circle appeared, than another of the same size right next to it, then I felt the hard object under the bruise.  Bruise is now completely gone but the hard mass is still there.",Duration:10 seconds,"Location: Coweta, OK",Occurred : 8/5/2016 23:45  (Entered as : 08/05/2016 23:45),Posted: 8/29/2016,Reported: 8/28/2016 12:57:10 PM 12:57,Shape: Fireball

1564,"3 crafts spotted hovering for hours over Lenawee County.  Red & white flashing lights approached quickly, then slowly rise into sky.I am a new mother and skeptic of ufos, but what I witnessed last night has made me a believer!  As usual, I was outside smoking a cigarette after getting my baby to bed.  I live in the country, so the night sky is pretty visible due to lack of city lights.  My husband and I witnessed 3 unknown crafts over a 3 hour period.  Two of which blinked red and white, while the other was a bright orange(also flew much closer then the other two).  The first object was spotted just above the horizon in the distance.  It appeared as an airplane with a red light, approaching quickly at first, then slowly began to rise into the sky while blinking red and white.  The red light appeared to be moving in circular motion around the craft as it hovered.  At around 4 am (an hour later), a second craft approached.  This craft appeared to have a long cigar like shape with orange illuminating light.  It appeared just south of us right above the neighboring tree line, flew low and quickly eastward, then disappeared low in the tree line miles away.  When this craft flew near us, we could hear dogs from 3 different houses begin to bark wildly. Finally a third light appeared, flashing red and white like the first craft, following the same flight pattern as the first. Both lights were still visible hovering in the sky at 6 am when the sun began to rise.  These crafts made no noise and gave me a very uneasy feeling. I was unable to take my eyes off the hypnotic lights.  I lost sleep thinking about what I had just witnessed, and feared  that I could no longer deny ufos exist.

1576,"Flying object outside of aircraft.On WestJet flight 166 from YVR to YEG, we spotted an object out our starboard window, approximately 700-1000 meters from the plane.It was about 40-50 minutes into our flight.  We had reached cruising altitude approx. 35k ft.When we first saw it, it looked like a large ball at the front with a long net-like or skirt-like structure trailing it.  At first we thought it was a scratch on the window, then it started moving in a flowing like manner.The ball shape at the front was always at the lead of the direction it was moving.  Same direction as the plane - or so it appeared.It was black.We were stunned and trying to understand what we were looking at for about 1-2 minutes before I started taking pictures.  At that point it had flattened out or turned and appeared flat.The object was by our side for approximately 3 minutes until we past it.It had structure.  It was not smoke or a contrail.I can only roughly approximate the size as it was far away but close enough to see detail. 10-15 meters long and 5 meters wide when spread out.We stayed on the plane until everyone had left and asked the pilots if they saw it.  They said they did not.Trying to understand what it was.  Can't explain it currently.  Looking for help or someone that has seen something similar.It was a safety concern.  It was close to the plane.  Whatever it was, if it got in the engines, it would have been trouble.Thought it might be a drone, but that is high for a drone, especially with the long thing flying behind it.Aerodynamically, the flowing skirt doesn't make sense.  It creates drag.  Kites use ribbons for stabilizers, not for lift.  Only thing similar I can think of is a sail, but the ball thing was at the lead, not the skirt.Photos and video:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zrq9uorr1vbsm46/AACbF_Xk5wWWLRVZ90o1GPSHa?dl=0  The video is faint.

When we started looking around we realized that most of these objects were going threw the clouds and if they were close to the clouds you could see the light faintly projecting on the clouds.  I started to count them and would get to about 20 and lose count because they were moving around so fast these objects could be going in a forward trajectory and change trajectory in the opposite direction without hesitation basically these things could move in any direction it so chooses to go in without hesitation and with speed that is hard to phathom.  Then we noticed there were big white light objects still out side the atmosphere, which were big bright white lighted objects!  We could tell these were still outside the atmosphere because the smaller blue lighted objects were shooting a concentrated beam of light towards the bigger objects and you could see how far it was having to travel before it made contact with these objects.  The bigger objects started a umbrella like formation that ran north to south, east to west, northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast as far as I could see horizon to horizon my view of all these was not a wide open view either it was pretty limited due to trees.

At about 10 pm, after most of the crew had gone to bed in their tents, we all heard a loud whirring noise; 3 of us that were still out of our tents looked up to see what was making the noise.  About 75 to 100 yards away was a matrix of green lights, some in evenly spaced square formations and some appearing in diagonal formations; we estimated 15 to 20 lights were visible.  The slowly moving object appeared quite large as the wall of green lights passed over the trees.  Our view of the object was at about 20 to 30 degrees from horizontal.  My headlamp was pointed directly at the object, but no form could be seen other than the wall of lights.  There was no wind or air disturbance which might have been evident if a conventional aircraft or turbine powered hovercraft were taking off or passing over.  After about 15 to ! 30 seconds the wall of lights and whirring noise vanished.  The U.S. military is known to conduct exercises in the Philmont Scout Ranch so there is a possibility that this was some type of military hovercraft, but nothing like I have ever heard or seen.",Duration:15-30 seconds,"Location: Philmont Scout Ranch, NM",Occurred : 8/3/2016 22:00  (Entered as : 08/03/16 22:00),Posted: 8/16/2016,Reported: 8/11/2016 10:15:07 AM 10:15,Shape: Unknown

1592,"Strange, white, glowing, moving lights where seen by at least 5 people during the day.On August 3, 2016, I was driving to a recycling center in Costa Mesa, when I saw 2 rectangular wall shapes made up of white circles.  One wall was coming in from the left and the other from the right and they looked like they were going to collide with each other.  Suddenly, they came together into a huge ball and then split like atoms.  I saw the individual white circles glow like flames as I was approaching the recycling center.I parked my car, grabbed my cell phone and started to record the lights move in a dance. Some white lights glowed brighter than others.  The lights looked like alternating flames of brightness.  I screamed and told folks to look up.  All the people ran and stared.  At first, we thought the lights were balloons until the alternating light and dance happened in unison.  Folks grabbed their phones and started screaming and filming.  The man filming next to me can be heard saying “there’s too many of them” and I can be heard agreeing with him.  I was very excited. It was impossible to count how many crafts there were.  I estimated about 15.A few minutes later, they started leaving as they ascended past the clouds.  Only one lingered behind, sitting on top of a cloud.  After all the others were gone, the one that stayed behind flashed and disappeared!!!  The video footage I posted was slowed down so that you can see the white lights.  When played in slow motion, you can see some of the lights glowing. I paused the one light that lingered above the cloud.  Look at it on the left.The sun was too harsh and made it difficult to capture the video.  This is why my camera is moving so much.  I have been following these lights for over 4 years now.

1641,"It looked like a brown boxcar way up into the sky.  In approximately three seconds it disappeared behind a cloud.Exact E-Mail sent to a friend in Chicago:  About a week ago, I was sitting on my second story balcony.  I was looking at a glob of cobweb on several of the nearby trees and remembered that we had eight papershell pecan trees on our farm and lost three to the same caterpillar worms that created those webs.  I thought that they were catalpa worms, but I was mistaken.  I gazed over to another much taller tree and was looking for the same glob of cobwebs that I had seen before in that tree.  Then I jumped up from my seat and was amazed at what I saw crossing the sky, almost out of sight.  It was so high.  I went inside and returned seconds later, with binoculars (10x20) to see the same object disappear behind a cloud.  I never got the binoculars up to my face.  I fear commitment into the local sanatorium, should I mention what I saw that day. It had all the appearances of a flying boxcar.  No, no, not the WW 11 Flying Boxcar.  This object looked brown in color and had no wings or appendages of any type.  It looked like a railroad boxcar.  Now then, if you want to have me evaluated for mental exhaustion or dementia of the worse kind, I will gladly keep my door unlocked if you tell me when they might arrive.  I know I saw what I saw, if you know what I mean.  I made the mistake of telling my immediate neighbor whose door is two feet from my door.  She is a nurse at the local hospital.  We are friends and she is getting married in September.  She playfully said that ""OH, no, your not seeing things, those do exist and I can't remember what they are called."" Then the subject was quickly changed.  Understand, I have majored in philosophy in college, and the proper instructions of using ones five senses are well incorporated in my mind.  I believe in and follow the philosophy of 'Objectivism.""  So, am I seeing things?  Do I need to self commit?  Do you have any knowledge of the brown flying boxcar that I observed on that day?

1643,"10 white lights seen in SE wisconsin at high altitude heading from south to north. several objects split off. Retired Army and wife BSNMy wife and I were outside our house looking at the stars at 2300 hrs., when I noticed a light at very high altitude, traveling south to north.  I told my wife, and she saw it too.  We watched it travel south to north for several minutes.  Within a minute we saw 2 more lights flying 1 behind the other, I put my fingers up to try and see how close they were together but even my little finger covered both lights.  We saw them at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  When they were directly over head the rear light released to smaller objects that started traveling 1 east and 1 west, same type of light just a bit dimmer.  Then several seconds later we saw 2 more lights same description and angle of appearance, traveling again south to north.From  2300 to 2315hrs, we counted a total of 10 lights, traveling from the south to north direction.  And 2 lights that came in from the southwest until they were directly over our house and then turned north.  As soon as we lost sight of those 2 lights, out of nowhere, 1 light came out of the north, but at a higher angle, maybe 60 degrees above the horizon, and was traveling south but at a much higher speed then the other lights we had seen.None of the white light objects we saw had any strobe or blinking lights of aircraft.  None of these objects produced any sound either, I spent nearly 3 decades in the military, I am very familiar with military aircraft traveling at high speed and altitude and even they produce sound, and my wife is a very well educated nurse.  I looked online to see if there are any  satellite orbiting are location, from space weather.com nearest orbit in 100 miles to our west.  Jet stream information from intellicast.com shows jet stream traveling across our area from northwest to southeast, so these objects were under there own propulsion, not being pushed by they wind.  We are not sure what we saw, but from are stand point they would fall into the UFO description.  My wife took a video via smart phone of 1 of these lights.We have noticed lights moving in the night sky before 2 weeks ago the local news was informed of lights in the sky and a story was done due to the volume of calls they had received.  I have also seen similar lights before and had aircraft change course to follow them, do the close proximity of the aircraft and speed they pursued they were without a doubt military.  Last month I thought I saw one of these lights and can  swear it actually dropped an object that looked like it was heading down, but this object I guess was most likely over lake Michigan, off Milwaukee.",Duration:15 minutes,"Location: Greendale, WI",Occurred : 7/31/2016 23:00  (Entered as : 07/31/16 23:00),Posted: 8/2/2016,Reported: 8/1/2016 12:34:00 PM 12:34,Shape: Light

I scrambled to get camera and video but could only get some still shots due to memory and low batteries.  Over the course of about 15 minutes I observed at least 25 red orange lights coming over my yard low and silent.  They came from the northeast and most traveled Southwest with a few veering off to the west and south.  They would come over one or two at a time.  I was so excited I started flashing some patio lights and in response I believe, one of the craft shut its light off.  I could then see that there was a much larger circular shaped dark object where the light had been.  Another one shut its light off a bit later and that time it looked more rectangular and flat to me.  I was left wondering who was that?  Us or them?  Is that our government testing things or is that something from a place far away?  I waited this year to see if they would come back on the same day but nothing.

They were moving very slowly and steadily, in a horizontal manner across the sky.  This was then followed by a circular green light that appeared to be ushering them along.

1735,"We saw a very large, long object with orangish lights on the bottom, moving over the tree tops right in town.On Wednesday, July 27th, 2016 at approximately 2238 hours, in the City of Buhl, County of Twin Falls and State of Idaho, my husband and I we're at the intersection of Clear Lakes Road and the Highway 30 traffic light. We were facing south preparing to turn eastbound when the light turned green. My husband was driving and I was the frontseat passenger. It was a clear night with lots of stars out.  I happened to look through the trees in front of us, across the road to the south. I believe something caught my eye. The light turned green, and as we were turning to the left, I noticed the street lights seemed to be moving or trailing lights. Then I realized that the lights weren't moving&#894; it was something right above them or what seemed to be almost parallel with them above them. I noticed something very low in the sky just above the tree line, that looked kind of like long railroad cars, traveling eastbound with orangish lights at the bottom. This was a huge mass in the sky and I began to verbalize to my husband something like, “what the F*#@ is that!” Fair Street (4100 N 1500 E) was just immediately to the right (south)of us, where you can turn Southbound and the object in the sky looked to be almost landing behind the buildings and the grocery store on Highway 30. It looked to be going behind Ridley’s Market or the Kacy Meadows Apartment complex. My husband pulled into the grocery store because that was actually where we were headed before going home that night. I told him to keep going east through the parking lot, because the object had become too low and I was searching for a clearing between the buildings to view it. We pulled in between King's Department Store and the laundromat, which share the same parking lot as Ridley’s Market, onto a little dead end street. We could again see the object heading eastbound so we decided to turn around and follow it. It seemed to already be about a mile east of where we had first witnessed it, but was now higher in the sky. We got back out onto Highway 30 (4100 N) in front of the buildings and headed Eastbound at 45 miles per hour down ‘Millionaire Row’ out of Buhl. The homes and the tree line on the south side of the road obstructed our view from the object for a short time as we traveled out of Buhl. We could now see the object up in the sky, probably another half mile to the East of us, but now it looked to be in a vertical position instead of horizontal. We turned southbound at approximately 1700 East, just one mile east from where we first saw the object in the City of Buhl. After traveling approximately one mile southbound, I made my husband pull over and I got out of the truck to see if I could see the object clearer because it was now on the driver’s side of the vehicle and seemed to be hovering or moving really shlow. It looked to be about a half mile off the ground. At this time, I saw a plane circling to land at the Twin Falls airport south of Twin Falls, Idaho. The plane looked to be about a mile or so higher in the sky than the object we were following. For a second, I thought maybe this was a strange aircraft also heading towards the airport, but it wasn’t. The object looked to still be heading eastbound, slightly curving to the south. We began to drive southbound again, where I knew if we could get onto 3700 North and travel eastbound, we could drive without having stop signs and have clear visibility to keep tracking the object and perhaps get nearer and underneath it. We headed eastbound on 3700 North at approximately 45 to 50 miles per hour. The object seemed to be hovering now and not moving that much or at a slow rate of speed. I told my husband to turn on the next mile road, turning left, back towards the north. It seemed that at that point, we would be able to get a closer observation and still be able to maneuver in a few directions if the object decided to start off again. The next mile road was 1800 East. We had traveled approximately 3 miles to the east from first seeing the object.  We parked our truck once again at the side of the road and turned the lights off, so we could get a better view of the object in the sky. I believe we watched the object for approximately 5 minutes when it proceeded to then slowly move back towards Buhl but in a northwest direction instead of straight back to the west. We were afraid we would lose sight of the object because it seemed to be moving at a rapid pace and towards the North and we knew the roads we were traveling on broke up between fields. I was able to keep tracking the object with the passenger side window down while my husband drove the vehicle westbound on what I believe was 3800 North. The object seemed to be high in the sky and moving quickly in a northwest direction. We then turned northbound on 1700 East and continued northbound until we stopped at Highway 30 (4100 North). I then told my husband to head West, back into Buhl and to try to navigate to the Buhl Cemetery area (1574 E 4150N), where I knew there would be no city lights and a clearing, where we could view the object in the sky.  We then turned Northbound taking a right on 1600 East and traveled a half mile to the cemetery Road and then continued a short length afterwards and again parked the vehicle at the side of the road and turned off all the lights. The object that I'd been tracking seemed to be a couple miles west of Buhl. I gauged it over some irrigation pipeline for reference, so my husband could find it in the sky when he got out of the vehicle. After a short time watching the object we had tracked, three more lights came to the area where the original object was located in the sky&#894; 2 from the south and 1 from the north. They looked to be in formation with the object we had tracked, approximately a half a mile apart from each other object. I pointed these lights out to my husband. (texted my daughter at 2302 & 2304 hours) I called my youngest daughter (2307 hours) to tell her what we had been seeing. She called back (2308 hours) and told her I wasn't sure who to contact in order to see if these were military aircraft&#894; knowing that the military base near Mountain Home, Idaho would be having a three week drill coming up this next month. The 4 lights seemed to be moving slower towards the west&#894; but still slightly visible to the eye. My husband decided that since the lights were now too far away to view, and our cell phones were not capable of taking good video or images, that we would go home and he would try to locate the objects in the sky with his field glasses. When we got home, located approximately 2 miles south of our Cemetery location, we were out in the front of our driveway and we did not see anything in the sky right away. Within a couple of minutes, I saw a light appear again in the west. It got brighter as it moved east. There was a regular type of aircraft circling low in the sky, that seemed to stay on the outskirts of this ufo object&#894; as if it was tracking it. The object came from the West, low in the sky (vertically), and headed Northeast at a slow pace. My husband had his field glasses and said that the object looked like a Christmas tree shape. The object was low in the sky. As it traveled further to the east, it was harder to tell if it was traveling vertically or horizontally. There was no way to tell if this object was the same one that we had initially tracked or a different object&#894; however, it was the same shape and size as the object we had seen when we had tracked it east of Buhl and had parked at the roadside to make observation. I went inside the house and got online to see if our local newspaper or news channel had anything posted&#894; which they didn’t. I then went to the UFO report website to find the instructions on how to report this. During our tracking of this ufo, I had tried calling and texted the City of Buhl on-duty officers&#894; my coworkers.  I had also called and talked to my daughter to see if she could get online and see if anything was being reported. By morning the next day, it was reported that it was space debris or meteors&#894; but what we tracked could not have been.((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.

1743,"Two UFOs witnessed between Boise and Mountain HomeWas driving a truck eastbound on I-84 towards mountain home.  The actual UFO looked to be about where Mountain Home, ID, should have been and maybe even beyond that.  I was just around mile marker 70 when I spotted what appeared to be two darker orange glowing objects, both leaving a trail of the same orange streak that seemed to also sort of change to white intermittently.  They were coming from the South and flew next to each other in an arc towards the horizon in a North East direction.The entire episode lasted what I would estimate to be between 2-4 minutes in total.  Initially, I thought they were jets.  Because there is an airfare base in Mountain Home, but these were too colorful (in my opinion) to be jet streams.  They were moving fast enough that I didn't think them to be commercial airliners, but still too slow to be meteorites or shooting stars. As the two objects came across my peripheral, they seemed to change from orange to white.  Finally, as they were moments from the horizon.  The bigger object (or maybe just the closer one) seemed to burst a green glow from the front of it.  Something that also made it seem to accelerate in a downward motion towards the horizon.  As the flash of green occurred, the smaller object of the two (or maybe just the farther one) seemed to gain momentum and pass the larger object.  As it did so, objects became increasingly brighter (orange/white), and trailing the farther object (which at this point seems to be roughly the same size as the larger) has at least 2 white dots following behind it. So in a line, the farthest object that now appears to be the same size and ahead of the close one, and behind it a least 2, possibly 3 white dots following behind in it's orange trail.  Close behind is the second original object with it's own trail.  Could not distinguish any objects in the second one's trail...mostly out of excitement. Seconds after these extra objects were noticed, the whole formation of lights and trails disappeared behind what might have been mountains over the far North East horizon. I'm not opposed to constructive criticism in any way, so if this sounds like a normal happenstance involving meteorites or something similar please let me know.

It isn't uncommon to see drones because Beale AFB is 10 miles north of my house.  But something about this one was different.  This one seemed to be higher up in the sky than normal.  It wasn't flying in a straight line like every one I've seen.  It seemed like it had short burst of speed and would veer to the west when it had a burst.  I decided it was worth watching and so I went out front and watched it until it disappeared.  This one ended up heading North West and ended up heading over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

1789,"golden ball with tail of sparks over sierra Nevada MountainsI was at the west edge of Chico, looking east toward the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with a dark sky above.  I saw a large, bright golden ball with a thick tail of what looked to be sparks, moving at about the rate of an airplane.  It was moving from south to north and lowering in altitude gradually, not steeply.  As I watched, the ball split into two pieces and both continued in the same direction.  The one in the front was larger than the one in the rear and it began moving faster than the smaller one in the rear, so the distance between the two became greater as they continued in the same direction from south to north and lower toward the mountains.  From the time I first saw it, as one ball with a tail of sparks until after it split into two and both disappeared behind the silhouette of the Sierras might have been a minute.

But this was very different.  It had a lit tail behind it, and instead of hovering still, it was traveling fast from West to East, at a downward slant.  We thought it was a plane in distress, however it was silent.  We jumped up to get a better view, and became aware that the light was only the front end of something much much larger. There was a front white light which cast a lit tail behind it, a center lit up by fog or smoke and with red glowing material like red hot coals or hot metal, and finally a back greenish light.  The object moved extremely fast from one end of the valley to the other within 60 seconds, and based on trajectory, would have touched down somewhere between Kingman and Valle Vista.

1824,"Not sure what I just witnessed, but it was very unusual.  I just took my dog out for his last bathroom run, when I noticed a light that, at first, I thought it was a satellite.  It was much brighter than a satellite, and as I stared at it passing across the night sky in a mostly easterly direction, I realized the altitude was much lower than what a satellite would be at. It also seemed it wasn't maintaining a constant speed, sort of slowing a bit and then resuming an otherwise constant speed.  I found it so unusual, I ran out to the end of our dock on Lake Whatcom and watched it eventually disappear over the distant mountains.  Never seen anything like it before.

1827,"Two objects seen in central Oregon.The night of Tuesday, July 26, 2016, I was up late watching a movie.  I cannot state where I live as I also work there, and any mention of the organization I work for by name gives them the right to own this report, but I can say I am a fire lookout.  At about 22:30, I had to go to the bathroom and walked out onto the catwalk of my fire lookout and noted a white light with red and green flashing lights to the north just off the horizon.  I assumed it to be an airplane, but took note of it because it was not on the general metropolitan to metropolitan flight paths that cross over my area, and it appeared significantly lower than standard planes.  The lights were also brighter and larger than far-off commercial airliners.I went back into the lookout and finished my movie, and at about 23:00 I went out on the catwalk to brush my teeth and noted the object was still there and appeared to have not moved at all.  This surprised me, as neither airplanes nor satellites stay in the same place for that period of time.  After brushing my teeth I returned inside and looked at it through binoculars briefly, then pulled out my spotting scope and fixed on the object at 60x.  I cannot accurately gauge the object’s distance, but judging by the increase in size of the object through the spotting scope I would estimate it to be 30 to 50 miles away with an exact azimuth of 22.2 degrees from my position (as measured with an Osborne Fire-Finder 1934 model).  The object was kite like in shape, but narrower side to side and longer top to bottom.  It had a white/orange light in the center similar in color to an old halogen headlight, with a red light below and right of the white/orange one, and a green light above and ! left of it.  The object itself was dark, and I can only estimate at its shape due to the visible light emitted from the white/orange light.  The white/orange light remained constant but the green and red lights alternated strobing.  As this is the standard pattern for commercial aircraft, I then wondered if this was a helicopter and my mind was simply making the shape with the visible light it could see.  Within the 60x magnification of my spotting scope however, the object did not move out of the frame from 23:00 to 00:00.  That would require an object to remain absolutely still, uncharacteristic of helicopters.At midnight is when I witnessed its only visible change.  At midnight exactly, another object entered the sky while I was looking through the scope, so I did not see it immediately when it assumedly rose above the horizon.  It was below the previously listed object, slightly to the right, and did not come more than a few degrees above the horizon at any given time.  I also looked at this one through the spotting scope. The shape appeared to be two isosceles triangles facing down, connected together at the widest point.  The color was red at the top, orange in the center, and yellow at the bottom, with these three colors seeming to be lit up in a repeating wave pattern from top to bottom.  One triangle was dark while the other was lighted, and once one triangle went through its lit cycle of red-orange-yellow, it went dark and the other one repeated the cycle.  The rhythm of this light show of the two triangles was extremely fast.  The right triangle appeared in full and to perfectio! n as I could see all three corners; however when the left triangle lit up its top right corner was cut off at an angle.  This leads me to believe the right triangle was closer than the left, and the object was slightly turned away from me so I was not viewing it straight on.  Upon first viewing this object was rising above the horizon, stopped, hung at a single point without moving for exactly two minutes, then at 00:02, dropped below the horizon.  During the two minutes the double-triangle shaped object was in the air, the kite-shaped object previously listed in this report, rose in the sky 3.5 degrees (measured with an Osborne Fire-Finder) straight up at the exact same azimuth it was at previously.  The Osborne Fire-Finder can observe a tenth of a degree change for any given azimuth, and the kite shaped object did not move a tenth of a degree.I remained awake until 01:30 hours when I had to fall asleep as I had work the next day.  I am used to waking up at 06:00 so I was extremely tired.  The kite shaped object was still in the sky and still located in its second position listed in this report.  I awoke after daybreak at 07:30 and the object was not visible.",Duration:2 hours,"Location: Diamond Lake, OR",Occurred : 7/26/2016 22:30  (Entered as : 7/26/2016 22:30),Posted: 8/2/2016,Reported: 7/27/2016 11:20:15 AM 11:20,Shape: Triangle

1835,"Three white lights in a vertical formation, northeast of State CollegeI feel foolish for not submitting this sighting the day I had witnessed it.  But seeing the recent reports in the northeast about three lights travelling so close together around the time of my sighting, I feel compelled to submit a report of what I saw.I don't remember the exact date, but it was around the last week of July, perhaps July 26th.  However, I do know that it was between 5:30 and 5:40 A.M., because this is the time that I go to work.Details:  As I was headed northeast on I-99, I noticed three bright lights in the northern sky, only several degrees above the horizon.  These lights remained very close to one another in a vertical formation, never separating more than about one degree from the other.  The movement of the formation was very slight, but there was definitely movement.The lights were bright white, almost silvery.  I could not distinguish a tail or anything of the sort.  As an amateur astronomer, I know for a fact that they were not planets because they were well north of the ecliptic.Conditions: Seeing conditions on this morning were clear.  During this time frame, it had been very hot in my area, with highs from the upper 80's to the mid 90's, and lows from the mid to upper 60's.If you could mark my position on Shiloh Road, looking toward the northeast drawing a straight line, the line would pass over Pleasant Gap, State Game Lands 295, and Williamsport.  There was no way for me to guess the distance of the formation.Hopefully, someone saw the same thing and can corroborate this sighting.

1850,"30 minute lapse in memory, hallucinations, nose bleeds and astronomical anomalies.My friend and I were driving eastbound, after waiting for an accident to be cleared off I-90, we both had a memory laps of roughly 15-45 minutes and had feelings of ""being in a trance or dream state,"" staring at the moon and seeing faces, feeling paralyzed.  The last thing I remember was the giant red metal train bridge you pass under just before Vantage, we have no recollection of crossing the Columbia River on the bridge or seeing the wild horses monument or George, WA.  We both ""came too"" sometime after George, WA, and being confused as neither of us could remember anything about crossing the bridge.  The moon was 3 times its normal size and bright red, I couldn't stop starring at it and it made me uneasy I kept seeing screaming faces in it.  It felt like I was dead or dreaming, this morning my friend called me and talked more about how confusing everything was and he asked me to check if there was blood on my pillow as he experienced nose bleeding for the! first time ever.....there was blood on my pillow.

1854,"Two bright red lights seen after dark, moving slowly across the beach, over the lake, and then rapidly diminishing into distance.On the last night of the Gimli Film Festival, in a crowd of hundreds, sitting on the beach of Lake Winnipeg after dark, watching the screening of The Goonies.  It was warm, humid, very few clouds (stars and moon were easily visible).  About half an hour into the feature I noticed above and to the right of my peripheral (the film screen--which is on the beach--faces west) I saw a fairly bright red light moving West to East in the sky.  They were nearly as bright as a distant road flare, or about the brightness of a traffic light.  I'm guessing they were no more than about 1 or 2 km away.I watched this red light as it moved in a more-or-less straight line at first moving slowly then about the speed of an airplane, towards the left somewhat behind the top of the screen. What strikes me odd is that there was no discernible sound as you'd expect from any airplane (granted the intermittent sound from the movie speakers may have masked it), nor were the lights blinking at all in any way (as you'd expect from any airplane).  At first I thought it might be a drone with a light attached to it but a drone would not have continued travelling so far out over the lake.Within one minute from the moment that first light appeared I see a second identical light, following a similar path, they were perhaps 500 meters apart (or the length of two hands held up).  So for a minute or two I watch both objects as they seem to either diminish or speed off into the distance across the lake, and at a higher altitude, possibly into distant cloud cover, but unsure since I recall still being able to make out pinpricks of light before they were completely gone.I estimate their average speed was 250 km/h; sighting lasted under 5 minutes, lights appeared to cross the lake which is about 25km in that direction.I considered taking a video on my phone for evidence but figured surely it must be something ordinary what with all these other people seeing it also.Then again I'm pretty sure if the lights were from an aircraft they would have stayed within view for a lot longer as I have previously seen planes fly across the lake at night; it takes more time for a light to travel out of sight, especially the further it gets.  In other words a plane's lights appear to move faster when it is near, and slower towards the distance.... these lights were precisely the opposite--slow when near, faster in the distance.  I can rationalize a great many lights or objects in the sky, but I don't have a good-enough explanation for these two.  If they were some kind of lit-up balloons they would have stayed visible for a lot longer, and with little to no wind would not even have traveled from the trees, across the beach and over the water in so little time.  If they were meteors/fireballs/etc., they'd have fallen in a downward--not upward-direction.  If they were planes there'd have been a blinking green light, unless it was taking off or landing then a br! ighter white light. Maybe a military plane has just a steady red light, but then I'd have definitely heard the sound of a jet engine, especially if accelerating to vanish into the distance towards the other side of the lake.  But let's suppose it was a plane with a solid red light just it was too high to have been heard... then how could the light have been so unmistakably bright over the beach?  Bright enough to distract an entire audience from watching a movie?  Not even the Northern Lights managed to do that until the movie was over.",Duration:3 minutes,"Location: Gimli (Canada), MB",Occurred : 7/24/2016 22:30  (Entered as : 07/24/16 22:30),Posted: 8/2/2016,Reported: 7/28/2016 12:14:29 PM 12:14,Shape: Light

I have insomnia so at about 1:30 a.m., I was still awake.  My husband was fast asleep and I didn't know what to do with myself so I decided to sit on the veranda.  The veranda was very small just big enough for two chairs and a very small table.  The veranda was covered by the floor of the veranda on the deck above us so to see directly above the ship you had to lean out.  The area directly below the ship and maybe 40 feet out could be seen because the ship had some lights on.  The area had fog rolling in in patches. I was looking out over the water, towards the land, and then up at the sky. In between wispy patches of fog, the sky was clear.  I started noticing a small ""lighter"" area in the clear sky that would come from directly above the ship and move more west then go back over the ship.  When it went back over the ship I couldn't see it anymore.  I decided to get our binoculars that my husband had bought for our trip. They are very expensive binoculars with image stabilizers. I retrieved them and went back outside.  I was leaning over the railing trying to see if the ""lighter"" area would come back and sure enough it did, moving westward again.  I looked through the binoculars and couldn't believe what I was seeing.   There were 6 dull yellow oval orbs flying in a group.  I can only explain the movement was like animals moving together and ""jostling"" each other. I ran in to wake my husband.  He wasn't happy about it, but he went on the veranda half asleep.  I explained what I saw but they were gone.  He went back to bed. This happened 2 more times.

1871,"	It was approximately 12:45 am (00:45) in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, when I heard a faint whirring sound coming from outside.  I was sitting in my living room, inside my apartment, watching TV.  I turned my head to look out the screen door of my balcony, thinking it might be someone flying a toy helicopter (because I was not expecting what I saw), and instead see a green light just sitting there, about the same brightness of a star, but bigger than the typical one observed in the sky at night.  As it just sat there still, the whirring noise had stopped.	About five seconds had passed, when I then said out loud to my mother, who was sitting next to me, “What is that?”  I watched it for about another five seconds, and as I stood up to get a closer look, the light started to move again.  As it moved, I got a clearer look at if the light was coming off of anything – it was coming off of a grey disc/saucer shaped object.  The object made a slight turn, almost like a U-turn, and then ascended up higher into the sky and came towards my apartment building, flying up and away above it.  The whole time it was moving, the whirring sound occurred.	I went outside onto my balcony and looked around but I could no longer see it. My mother had not seen anything but she believed me when I told her what I saw.  I only observed one saucer but it was moving much faster and stranger than an airplane or helicopter would.  I am not sure if anyone else observed this, whether from their balconies or the street below.  I am almost positive that what I saw was a UFO.

Being curious as to what this flash was, I continued looking up vertically while trying to safely drive.  I could see airplanes in the air and a big full moon, I'm sure it wasn't lightning... It wasn't overcast nor was there any rain at all and  the flash was silent....  No thunder.

For the record, the movie was ""Straight Out Of Compton"", which I mention only to disway any notions that I was watching anything related to the paranormal and my imagination got the best of me; thoughts of UFOs were very far from my mind! Just to the left of my TV is a large, south-facing window that I keep open this time of year.  While there are a few tall but thin trees across the street from me, I have a pretty good view of the sky from where I was sitting (on my couch).  There was not a cloud in the sky this night.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a distant lightning strike as the entire skyline lit up enough to put the trees in silhouette.  But.... no thunder... I dismissed it, believing perhaps a distant power transformer had popped...even though the hue of the light was markedly blue.  Ten to fifteen minutes later, it happened again.  At this point i! dismissed it as some kind of visual distortion... it was late...perhaps i had my eyes open too long and glanced at the window and imagined the flash...and as I was looking out the window, it happened again.My cat started going berserk about this time.  Normally, he is lazy.  Suddenly he was all about chasing invisible things, and meowing incessently.This went on until approximately 3am, at seemingly irregular intervals.

Quickly, but not as fast as it had just moved, it then flew back to the east and north.  At this point, it was so distant and with the bright Moon, I could barely detect it. I sat back down hoping it might reappear.  A minute or so went by, when it reappeared back in the area where it flew in circles before. It was doing this again, when it suddenly flew back towards the west and stopped roughly where I had first seen it.

1930,"Sickly, sweet smell permeates the air with no discernible cause.  My dog's barking was an alert.On this morning and day, I was inside, windows closed, air conditioning on.  Two of my four dogs were outside in enclosed large back yard.  I then heard my Newfoundland barking, as if something was wrong.  As soon as I stepped into my breezeway, which leads to the back yard and the door being open, I was hit with this very strong smell of something sweet and 'heavy' in the air.  It was a sickly sweet smell that I have never smelled before in my 60 plus years.  When my dog barks like that it means something is of concern so I always check it out.  The smell had no certain origin but all around.  I opened the back gate and walked to the wooded area and saw no one.  I looked into my neighbors' yards and saw no one.  I then looked up into the clear blue sky, thinking maybe it came from above but saw nothing.  I have, in the past, seen a cylinder shaped stationary UFO above my house, and have read that sometimes UFOs have been associated with smells or drifting silk-like substances.  Only the smell was there.  My dog stopped barking and the smell went away after maybe ten minutes.  I then felt a little dizzy and nauseous but that went away, also.

I know that the moon seems larger near the horizon than it does at the zenith, so it is difficult to compare the size of what I saw to the size of the moon – but the object was gigantic, more like the moon than anything else in the sky – exactly the size of a nearby street light, and as bright.  I do not mean that it illuminated the ground, but that it appeared as bright as the street light I could see at the same time.The object was yellow with a tinge of red, and looked like a flame without any sparks or smoke.  It was nearly round, tapering just a little toward the back end, but it had no tail, left no trail.  It did not blink or change its intensity.It was silent.Our local meteorologist says that, at that time, the wind was from the south at 8 miles per hour.",Duration:5 seconds,"Location: Springfield, MO",Occurred : 7/20/2016 22:15  (Entered as : 07/20/16 22:15),Posted: 7/22/2016,Reported: 7/21/2016 12:11:58 AM 00:11,Shape: Fireball

The time was 8:52 PM and it had just turned dark.We were sitting in the lawn area overlooking the ocean when we heard several people in a parking lot next to us to the south speaking loudly and pointing to a blinking object in the sky.  The object was about ½ mile south of our position, at about a 30–45 degree angle from our position, hovering over the beach at maybe 500’ (?).  From our position it looked small maybe about the size of a penny held at arm’s length. It looked like a sphere with a ring around it, kind of like the planet Saturn.  It had a lot of lights on it many different colors.  Very bright white/silver, green maybe others, not sure.  The white/silver lights were constant and there were others blinking.  There was a violet one on the bottom that blinked a lot slower than the others, maybe once every second.  The others were faster.The object hovered for about a minute that we observed.  It then slowly turned west then south arcing slightly as it did.  It then headed south slowly then VERY quickly picked up speed and continued south down the beach until we lost sight of it.My wife noted there was a small plane approaching the object from the north and when the plane got really close, the object turned and quickly sped away.

The sky was clear, and the only thing in the sky was an airplane with its small contrail about 45 degrees up (halfway), heading on down southwest, as is usual for planes bound for the Memphis airport.  A couple minutes later I got up and walked a few steps in my back yard.  For whatever reason I looked back up in the sky and to my amazement saw a glowing orb of light about halfway up more due west.  That first plane was a bit more south of west when I saw it.  This orb was a yellowish-white in color.  Its size was that of somewhat larger than what the planet Venus looks like in the night sky when it is the closet.  Also, I spotted another airplane a bit more north of west with its small contrail also headed in what I assumed was toward the Memphis airport direction.  This plane seemed headed for this orb, and the orb seemed to move a little going toward the plane.  In my line of sight, I ! was fearful they would collide.  However, the plane never veered off course and went right on. So that tells me they were not near each other; it was just my viewing of it.  The time was about 8:06 PM. I immediately ran into the house to get my binoculars (7X50).  But when I returned nothing was in the sky.  I am very familiar with those things that could make a similar flare of light, but those seem to last longer.  This appeared in those seconds after I saw the first plane and disappeared when that second plane was on away in its path.

I have always had a fascination with the sky, solar system, the universe all my life.

I believe what my friend and I witnessed happened around 1-2AM.The sky was partly cloudy which mostly foiled our plans of meteor watching.  Anyway, as I was staring up I saw something move.  It was no meteor and I don’t think satellites move the way this thing was.  I told my friend I saw something strange and tried to get her to see it, which she did.  We ended up watching this thing for about 45 minutes.But enough stage setting, this is what I saw:  It was bright and triangular shaped.  It was high up in the sky, higher than planes fly.  It moved way faster than a plane.  But the strange thing is it moved in short bursts.  When it made turns, these turns were almost immediate and in 90 degrees.  It also didn’t move across the whole sky, just in the same area of space; as if testing out its speed and maneuvers.  If you held a notecard out with your arm extended and the card facing you, the area of the card would block out the area of the sky this object moved in the entire time I watched (~45 min).  The craft would sit still for amounts of time between its bursts of high speed moving.  When it did make the sharp turns it would start out fast and then slow down just before the turn.

1989,Bright green sphere with long trailing tracer making 90 deg turns moving at a very high rate of speed across the night skyI had just picked up my daughter from work from her evening shift.  Pulled into the driveway and got out of the car.  My daughter disappeared into the house and the clarity of the evening sky and the moon caught my attention.  A bright green sphere with a long green tail trailing behind with very defined edges of colour.  I noticed a flash of light in the sky.  It dropped straight down at a 90 deg angle for about a sec to another 90 deg turn to the North.  At a very high rate of speed darted from the South due north  directly into the centre of the big dipper and disappeared.  Only one was seen. Was higher elevation than a plane but lower than a satellite or shooting star.  The trailing green light behind was about half the distance it travelled. as soon as the sphere disappeared the green tail followed and disappeared into the very same spot about a second later.  Total time seen was about 10 sec.I live in a rural area.  It was a clear evening.  The moon was roughly 240 deg in the sky.

1993,"Seen from my balcony, two bright red spheres (no blinking lights) followed an erratic flight path, or remained stationary, started again their pattern of sudden changing of direction.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello again, Mr. Davenport! The precise date was last Saturday, July 16 2016. I cannot be too precise about the time ... it was between 10:00PM and 11PM. For certain it was not after 11PM (I was on the balcony with my father during the sighting, then he left to watch the 11 local news).  That Saturday, I helped my sister packing (she's moving to her new house), and I was very tired.  I didn't come home from my sister before 9-9:30PM so the time I went out on the balcony must have been between 10:30PM and 11PM.  I forgot to mention that the spheres were quite big (my father was able to see them, his vision isn't too good).  Bigger than, let's say, the lights attached to the wings of an airplane. Their size, color and movement had caught my eye.Since that evening I searched the net to see if other people have had similar sightings (red spheres).  I found a couple of video clips, with different dates and locations, only in them the spheres were blinking.  I didn't know about this kind of spheres before I am familiar with the UFO  phenomenon, actually, I had had another sighting many years ago, not in the States. Mr. Davenport, if you want the exact location/position of the sighting, I can give you my home address.  With Google Earth you can access my street, which has at one end the highway wall (the sighting was above the wall, the spheres appeared from behind the wall, then disappeared only to reappear again, a couple of times). I hope this helps.

1996,"Very bright red light, moving slowly east to west then went straight up and disappeared.Observer:  Retired commercial pilot with over 45 years of flying experience.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Peter:My house is in a cul de sac and faces 060 degrees.  Traffic into Midway all day and evening were using 4R approach, which I am about 500ft to the right of center line.  The object appeared to be about 3 time the size of Venus, only red. Altitude is difficult to determine at night, but I would say not more than 5000 agl, as that is what I'm estimating from observing the aircraft and personal experience flying into Midway in this area.I was also the director of Flight Standards for ((deleted--aviation entity)) and Chief Check Pilot for ((deleted)) yrs in addition to my 40 some years of flying in the Chicago area.The object appeared to be heading 270 degrees from our perspective, (right to left).  My wife and grandson also observed the object.  No aircraft are vectored into Midway from that direction (to tight of a turn on to the localizer).It was no aircraft, as when I first saw it I ruled out Mars, as it was too low in the sky and much brighter.  Then I did look for position lights, and saw none.  It was at that time I called my wife outside, as I our grandson was already outside with me.  We then observed it for about another 3 minutes when it got to approximately 10 degrees to the right of our house, it went straight up and disappeared.  Distance from out house approximately 1-2 miles. Drivers eastbound on I-80 and northbound on I-55 would have seen it also.It was awsome.
