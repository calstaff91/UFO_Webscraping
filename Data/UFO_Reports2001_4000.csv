5,"Star-like object moves slowly across the sky until changing shape and fading out.I stepped out of the house for a few minutes to view the sky and full moon.  A few wispy clouds in a moon lit sky were observed, with some stars visible.  As I looked to the north, above my house, I saw what at first I thought was a star.  As I continued to look at it I noticed it was moving slowly in a linear trajectory, NNW to ESE. While keeping my eye on the object it appeared to pick up speed.  While doing so the bright round light changed to a more defined 'fuselage' with no wings.  It continued on until it slowly extinguished its light and faded out.  A possibility is that it went above a lower cloud bank, but I feel that was not the case.  This sighting is very similar to one I had over my house two months ago which I also reported herein.  That object, however, was lower in altitude and much brighter.Both object changed from a round light to an cylindrical light before fading out. No sound was heard from either object, no other lights visible on the craft, and the speed was about that of an aircraft.  Height estimate for this sighting I would have to guess at being 10 to 15 thousand feet, but it was impossible to know for sure.  Since I live a few miles from the Atlantic Ocean, the trajectory would take it out over the ocean as it continued.  This area is a 'hot spot' for UFOs for some reason.  Other local residents have hesitantly told me of their sightings, when I casually brought up the subject.  Some of their stories were quite extraordinary.",Duration:2 minutes,"Location: South Kingstown, RI",Occurred : 4/10/2017 19:15  (Entered as : 04/10/17 19:15),Posted: 4/13/2017,Reported: 4/10/2017 8:05:57 PM 20:05,Shape: Light

8,"Witnessed ""V"" shape craft, intercepted and escorted by jet.From around 34,000 feet, I noticed in a completely clear sky a chevron shaped object.  It was dark grey.  There were no clouds anywhere, and no other objects in the sky.We began our descent into Denver.  I estimate when I noticed it it was around 30,000 feet.  I believe it was moving the same direction we were only slightly slower.It appeared as a V.  As we descended, it flatted out in my perception and was completely flat and extremely thin.I witnessed a fast moving plane come in to my sight.  It seemed to have a wider jet trail that was angled more like a ""V,"" instead of a ""="" stream.The plane came in fast.  I couldn't make out what type of jet it was but it flew towards the object and made a quick turn around.  I could tell because of it's jet stream it was going towards the craft and then parallel with the craft.  It was above and to the side of the V shaped object.  It remained over the object until it was out of my vision.On Southwest flight.  This was probably somewhere in that New Mexico/North Texas/Southest Colorado area.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Seemed more of a darker gray, more black.  That's why it stuck out. On the smaller her I couldn't tell.  It was fast and made what looked like a a power slide maneuver when it got over top.  Once over top it seemed to do more of a hover/drift rather than fly.  So I don't think it was a commercial type jet.  I don't think those hover planes can do that maneuver that high in the air, but that's what it looked like.Yes, it looked like it ""wing manned"" it or was guiding it away.I'm not on crew.

I live in South NJ.  Around 10pm i was in east vineland at a friends farm covering his plants for the frost.  Its open farm fields so the view is good.  after we were done we began walking back to the house when i noticed a strange orange glow in the distant western sky just above the horizon but very far away.  Thought it might of been an distant airliner at first, but there were no blinking lights and the color was odd.  It reminded me of the nasa launch last year from va which i could clearly see from my location as well.  It climbed in altitude very quickly and covered that large distance away and was soon over the southern sky looking up at it at about a 45 degree angle and then was soon way out over the ocean heading in an east south east direction.  You could see the engine flicker and flame out just like the nasa launch when it the stage burned out.  This occurred near the coast.  I thought it was interesting since i hadnt heard of any launches.  But what concerned me was about 5 minutes later we saw another one, came from the same direction and headed the same way,  only it flamed out somewhat sooner over land but was still very high up by that point.  Then about 5 minutes later we saw 3 orange lights glowing way off in the distance same area again and they flew across the sky in the same direction, followed by 2 more not far behind it, then one more then one more that appeared to go up and then looked as if it was slowly coming back down but may have been going west giving that appearance as if it was coming down, by that point we all were like whats going on and went in the house to check the news, i was concerned with all the stuff on the news some war had started or something.

At 5:28 PM, EST, I began taking pictures of the sunset over the ocean.  I continued to take numerous photos until 6:31 PM.Later that evening as I was reviewing my photos, I was shocked to see an object in a frame that was taken at 6:16 PM.  It appeared to be hovering on the water.  It was iridescent green, hat shaped, and upon zooming in on the picture I could see bump like ridges.  In subsequent frames, but not all, it appeared again higher up in the sky in different positions - several times in an orb shape, and once changing shape to what I would describe as a three quarter uneven circle with clear indentations.I showed the photos to the ship’s photographer in search of a logical explanation, thinking it must have been a lens flash from my camera.

Additionally, I showed the photos to a ship’s officer.  He replied that it looked alien in nature.The next morning I heard that some fellow passengers were baffled over observing something that seemed to be “darting” over the ocean the night before but they could not capture it on film.Sunday – April 16, 2017, 8:00 PM, EST, AHC (American Heroes Channel) aired a program called “UFOs: The Lost Evidence.”  The entire segment was devoted to the theory, supported by evidence, some from the military, that the oceans are used as bases for UFOs.  Two images shown in the television segment resembled two of my photos.  One was the hat shape with ridges.  Another was an object found on the bottom of the ocean suspected to be a spacecraft – that shape resembled one of my photos of the object when it was in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report attempted to send photos to NUFORC, but they do not open, or perhaps were deleted from the e-mail.

40,"Walked out the door at approximately 8:52 p.m. to take a look at the last bit of the sunset on the west side of my house.Noticed a lot of lights in the sky and thought, boy, there's a lot of airplanes out tonight.  There were airplanes, but I saw a faint blue light moving at high speed underneath the clouds.  I looked around and saw few faint blue lights and wondered if they were connected as one large craft, because they were separated by quite a distance.  The distance of separation would have been at arm's length, if you held your hand out, arm stretched, in front of your face.  At first I thought they were in trying other patterns, because there was three of them I saw period, but then I realized they were separate.  I looked around and there were a whole bunch all around the entire sky all headed due north over Lone Peak mountain.  Each one was a faint small blue looking light moving at high speed coming much faster than an airplane moves.They could have been military drones but they were moving so fast, and it was clear their agenda was to travel due north at a very high speed.There was a whole swarm of them that travel from as far as the eye could see from the south end of American Fork City, over Highland City, and then over Alpine City and over the Lone Peak mountain.I walked outside as the last of them we're traveling from the south end of American Fork Andover Lone Peak mountain.  I probably conservatively counted 20 to 25 of them.  But I think there was a lot more!   I've never seen so many objects in the sky at once traveling so quickly and One Direction.  They were a very faint dim blue color, they weren't too difficult to see but the color of the sky, clouds and sunset made it more difficult to see them and they seem to blend in more.There were low-lying clouds and they were below the clouds and traveling up and through the clouds, and disappeared out of sight as they flew over Lone Peak Mountain headed north.Their blue light was constant and was not blinking.The color of blue was a very faint navy blue. They appeared like small craft, and seem to all be moving in a swarm, separated by the aforementioned distance when your hand was outstretched towards the sky.The strange thing was is that it was very windy outside, they did not seem to be affected by the weather or wind at all, especially given how small they appeared to be?

41,"I've seen strange lights in the night sky, but nothing this long or active before.Event started in the night sky with the appearance of three bright lights, forming an almost perfect upside-down triangle, just North of Orion's Belt in the North-West sky.  The triangle lights were of equal brightness and were too far apart to be from a single craft.  The upper two lights would take turns moving in and out of formation for a good twenty minutes before cloud cover obscured them.About thirty minutes later red and white lights started to appear and move in strange and an unconventional like manner in the North-West sky.  This was just North of where the upside-down triangle had appeared.  The lights were many and zig-zagging in all directions.Later two military jets came in from the south and the strange lights just bounced all around the two jets.  Eventually, they disengaged and headed back south towards Phoenix. By the look of their aviation lights they were probably F-16s.About ten minutes later another jet came in from the South-East.  This single military jet look like an F-22 from its aviation lights.  It headed in the direction of were the strange lights had last been seen.  Amazingly, by the time this military jet had reached the location of the strange lights, the lights were gone.  The fighter must have stayed in the area for a good amount of time before it also headed South.Later in the evening the three bright lights were back in almost the same location but the triangle was now pointing up with the lower left light being the brightest of the three.On a normal day or night, we have a lot of commercial East-West flights over our territory but not on this night.  During all this activity there were no commercial flights in the sky to be seen.

This time of day is usually very dark outside and sunrise would be approaching in about 30 minutes.

My brain ran through many possible reasons why I could see this bright round shape; is there a planet really close to us, was it a search helicopter in the distance, a weird street light off in the distance, anything that I could think of.  I stepped of the step and walked closer to the fence to see if I could get a better angle, possibly giving it a reference point or position.  It looked to be past the bayou, and possibly past the park.  Then it moved, very swiftly to the left and up. I froze blinking my eyes. Immediately telling myself no, nope, there is no way you are seeing things. Then it moved again to the right.  Now I  am retreating back to my steps. I stood there staring and then I checked the surrounding sky.  I could see stars, street lamps, trees, everything as normal, but nothing was as large as this object.  Then the moment came when I thought to myself, does it know that I am staring at it? I shook my head a! nd went back inside, almost had my daughter come outside to verify it.  I decided against that notion, I didn't want to worry her and also it was time for her to leave for school.  Made sure she was ready and out the door and I went right back outside to the garden to see if it still was there.  It was and this time I took photos. I noticed in the photos it is not as prominent or as large as it was to me standing there. I moved to a different spot to gain a better angle.  Still it sat in the same spot.  As the sun started to rise i thought that it would disappear into the light within a few minutes.  Minutes passed and I could still see it just as clear and now with little shimmers of metal.  The object stayed the same shape the whole time, and no lights flashed that I saw.  I started to water my garden and try and watch it at the same time.  I noticed that it started to move up and I had to reposition a few times to track it through the trees.  Then it slowly moved right more and then some more.

I looked up and saw the UFO.  It scared me too death.  It was falling, very fast.  It got closer and closer to the ground until it froze in mid air and I blinked.  When I opened my eyes it wasn't there.  This all happened within 15 seconds.  At its highest, it looked about the size of the sun.  Like it could block my view of it.  When it was falling it was massive.  I got pretty damn close to us.  I thought it was gonna squish us.  It was jet black.  I think it was on fire.  It smelled like burning plastic, and there was a gigantic trail of blue fire behind it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Witness is a student.

Once he saw them, we watched them circle each other and move around the sky randomly, almost as if they were playing with one another.  I noticed that a helicopter was flying nearby and these objects were much higher in the sky than an helicopter.  As we watched, we noticed that at one point all of them turned and the sun hit the objects creating 4 bright small circular objects in the sky.  We continued to watch them for about 4-5 minutes until they flew off into the distance away from the Orange County airport heading south about 20 miles inland from the coast.  The way these objects were flying, was almost as if they were birds playing in the sky, darting in and out and up and down and circling one another... not at all h! ow  commercial planes or helicopters would fly.

In that time each UFO flew in its own direction, northwest, one north and one north eastward.  During that time all of them suddenly disappeared.

63,"Around 8 pm, on April 5th, 2017, I videotaped a square object floating within the tailing end of a stormcloud.I was outside Lapine, Alabama, near route 331, when I noticed a lone storm cloud on the northern horizon.  The cloud was slowly moving west to east.  Many cloud-to-cloud lightning bolts were flashing within the cloud, but few cloud to ground bolts were visible.  The lightning bolts were blue-violet in color.  Many low rumblings were coming from the cloud, but few could be connected to a single lightning bolt.  A person watching the cloud with me commented that the lightning activity was both unusually quiet and concentrated within the cloud.  They stopped watching the cloud and went inside before the object became visible.  They also noted that their dogs, normally afraid of lightning, were unusually calm during the storm.I decided to videotape the electrical activity visible in the center of the cloud a few minutes.  After recording the central portion of the cloud, I thought it might be a good idea to record the rear.  The sighting occured during the following seconds.During a fraction of a second a lightning bolt lit up the rear of the cloud.  When it did, what appeared to be the corner profile of a building-sized rectangle appeared.  A second brighter flash illuminated a wider area, revealing more of the object.  The object then disappeared from view.  Between the two flashes, the object appeared to change shape.I recorded more video of the cloud hoping to see the object again, but failed to get any more footage.  Other clouds similar to the first passed by to the south.  Two planes flew in a line southward over the area about 5 to 15 minutes afterwards.A person I know in the area claims that a wifi dongle had to be reset due to activity that night, and/but I can't tell if the object was the cause.I was told that two weather radars were down for maintenance during this time.I have sent screenshots from the video to the email address below, but they aren't very detailed.

64,"Large lights slowly moving, diming in and out of visability. Abrupt angle changing motions, morphing.Want to start off by saying I have never seen this much activity in the sky over San Tan Valley.  I've seen a few things I couldn't explain in the past over this horizon.  Went in my backyard to feed dogs and I looked up in the sky like I always do.  Saw a bright red ""star"" in distance, which I thought was a plane heading straight at me. It got bigger as it approached then stopped in the sky.  It hovered over the San Tan Mountains for a while, then directly under it to the right another white light appeared.  Slowly drifted north.  Then another similar light appeared and did the same.  For a while the three lights formed an Isosceles triangle.  The two white lights drifted toward Chandler/Gilbert area and when they got over the populated area started to flicker like that of an airplane.  But not constant like a planes lights flashing.  The white lights started to flicker a lot and dipped under the horizon out of sight. The red ""star"" stayed still drifting upward slightly.  What I thought was a plane headed towards the red light, then stopped and completely changed directions and drifted upward.  Couldn't believe what I saw.  The red light then started to fade away but not until a bright white orb appeared under it, pulsated, shifted direction and disappeared.  Before the circus ended a smaller red orb drifted up to the red star and almost ""kissed"" it before changing directions and fading away.  Also when all this activity was happening I saw three aircraft in the sky fly by.  One flew almost directly over my house.  Had a big green light under it and I couldn't tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  Made almost no sound at all. The other two flew directly under an orb but must not have seen it.

The lights were pulsating very fast almost like an energy surge.  The best way to describe the lights would be comparable to halo lights, but soft white in color.

80,"Color changing, silent, slow moving oval above Portland's West Hills.I woke up because my cat was meowing at the window. I told her to be quiet, but she just kept on meowing, so I opened my eyes. I looked out of my window to see what the cat was meowing at thinking it must be a box elder bug on the glass or something, but instead I saw a big green oval of light.I live in a high rise building and can see Council Crest and the eastern side of West Hills from my apartment.  I can make out the houses and features of this part of West Hills well.  I could see a big green oval of light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving slower than a plane or helicopter, and seemed to be silent.  I put on my glasses so I could see it better out of curiosity and when I realized it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, I ran out of bed over to the window to get a better look. I saw the oval move towards West Hills.  Then it slowly went over the hill and then I couldn’t see it anymore.  The whole time it was floating around, it was gradually changing color from green to orange-red and back to green, with the color change seemingly starting towards the bottom right of the oval, and then sweeping over the rest of the oval until the thing had mostly turned orange-red.I don't know if the oval was solid or just light, but it seemed to have very clearly defined edges.  It was not like spot lights at all, which kind of have fuzzy, soft edges.I know the oval was not a plane because planes are not oval shaped and they move faster.  I see planes all the time from my windows, sometimes even antique ones, but this was not plane shaped and did not make any sound like a plane.  I know the green oval was not a helicopter because I see helicopters a lot, too, and they are noisy and I can clearly make out the helicopter shape.  In fact, I saw a helicopter come from the SW part of Portland towards the center of Portland a few minutes after I saw the green oval. I know this wasn’t a car on the streets of West Hills because I could clearly see the oval in the middle of the sky at first.  And I don’t think it was a drone because it looked to be wider than the houses it was above in West Hills when it was above them.  I thought for a second that it might be the aerial tram, which I can see a little bit from my place, but the aerial tram doesn’t change colors, it is not green and it doesn’t float around in the middle of the sky, obviously.  I don’t even think that tram runs at 12:30AM.I know the oval wasn’t making noise because I can clearly hear planes and helicopters from my apartment.  Also, even though this green oval floated really close to the houses on West Hills, nobody’s lights went on like they heard a loud noise above their house.  I had my window cracked and could hear the helicopter a few minutes later, so I know that the noise would have definitely have come through if there were any.I tried to take a picture of the oval but my hands were shaking and I kept dropping my phone because I was a little nervous about the green thing in the sky, not knowing what is was and all, and I was trying to make my cat stop meowing by petting her at the same time.  By the time I got my phone camera ready, the thing had floated over the West Hills and out of my sight.  I don’t know what the green oval thing was, so I am hoping maybe someone else does and can tell me.

81,"Blue dot in sky ascends and descends quickly with a plane flying by a reference.Looking SE from my 3rd floor apartment patio, saw what I thought at first glance was the police helicopter circling something but when I looked back it had done this super fast circle and immediately dropped behind the tree/building line of sight.  Seconds later it reappeared and achieved a very high altitude in seconds.  I recorded it on my phone and will be sending that footage to you guys as well. In the video, it appears as a blue dot and seems to hover for a bit then starts descending again as a passenger plane approaches. It lowers below the aircraft, hovers for a second, then continues its descent until out of view again. Shortly after a helicopter flew over the area as well as other lights that looked to be small aircraft or helicopters in the distance for about 10 minutes afterwards.I understand this could just be someone playing with a drone or whatever, but the altitude it appears to achieve and the speed it occurs at is something I've honestly never seen before.  Never seen a ""drone"" or anything like this flying in this area of Mesa/East Valley in my whole life.

89,I was lying on our roof getting some sun today.  It's an 8-floor apartment building in downtown SF.  Was there about a half hour lying on my back.  Decided to open my eyes and looked up to see something like a large bubble about 8 or 9 inches wide float by about 25 feet up and at a 50 degree angle from my horizon.  It had two really bright lights inside of it.  One in front and one in back.  The one in back flickered really fast while the one in front was steady in it's brightness.  Then I saw another about 10 seconds later and it continued to about 6 of them at different distances and different angles.  All of them heading east over my building.  The last one I got a video of was the farthest out at about 50 feet away.  I've seen orbs before but never this close and never was able to make out so much detail inside them.  The spherical outline was like a soap bubble but less reflection.  I could barely make out a front and back outline but the 2 white lights! inside were quite clear.  The video doesn't show any of the detail I was able to see with my eyes.  I'm left wondering why?  It appears as the usual white orb only but that's not what I saw.

110,"My experience started last summer, and continues on to this day.  Leading up to my current “issue” with these objects, my father had always talked about this light in the sky following him wherever he went.  He didn’t know why, or what it's intentions were.  He called it his “guiding light”.  He thought it was a surveillance drone and if it is, why him?  Well 3 years of this guiding light had him pretty nervous.  I had only heard the stories, until one night we were heading to my mother's house to visit (parents are separated), and before we got out of the driveway, he asked me, “What do you think that is?” and pointed at a very bright light in the sky.  My first thought was:  It’s a planet.  It was bright like Jupiter or Venus.  Until I noticed how low it was and that it seemed to be swaying or hovering.  Then I said it's a drone.  Dad then tells me to keep my eye on it and see what it does.Our trip was going to be from Lawrence, KS, to Kansas City, MO.  He puts the truck in gear and we go.  As did this bright light.  It would stay in the passenger window down I-70 then positioning itself directly behind us and it was like it locked on to our vehicle.  It would sometimes ascend higher and then come back down.  It was tracking us! I was mesmerized. I had never seen a UFO and here is a full on bright, unidentifiable flying object following us down the highway.  The object followed us all the way to 152 hwy in Kansas City, MO.We get into the city and this thing decides to completely blow my mind by joining up with 2 more lights to form a triangle formation.  I am saying all kinds of, “what ((deleted)) is that,” at this point.  And as we turn down the street to my moms house they all 3 got as faint as dim stars, one after the other, and disappeared.  This was the beginning of my fascination that has now become my reality.Fast forward almost one year later, I researched the hell out of these things.  I know now it's not a FBI drone.  Not a police surveillance craft.  This goes way beyond that.  I start living with my dad  about 5 months ago.  This thing would literally hover outside of his house every night along with 4 or 5 other objects mimicking stars and constellations.  I decided to start filming them because if it is government then they are violating our rights on all possible levels.  Also, because they fascinate me.  I have videos of triangle craft, hovering commercial jets, cigar UFOs in the day time.  Aircraft that I can't explain  doing things we have no context for.  Well they now follow me everywhere I go.  Any clear night I have 1-3 star UFOs hovering over the house. Possibly more.  As well as very strange airplane and triangle craft that circle the house really low.  Some will eject smaller drones I shit you not. I've been watching and studying these like it is my job.  The strange thin! g is I can't get any media outlets or MUFON to investigate this. I know I'm not the only one.  We need to call attention to it and get answers.  I didn’t ask to be tracked and surveilled by these things.  I'm not a criminal.  I'm not doing anything wrong.

I told the other passengers in my car to look and they too watched the lights.

For an additional 25 minutes all occupants of my vehicle watched as the lights danced and pulsed brightly then faded, then getting bright again, all while dancing through the clouds. We took a short video of the lights and several photos. The lights in total had a large circular shape, but the lights appeared to be moving in binary groupings. There were at least 20 individual lights, grouped into at least 10 pairings. While parked the lights faded and the cloud appeared to grow dark grey in a large oval shape. The lights were very faint while I could see the grey outline.

Also not a weather balloon it was moving South/Southwest to North/Northeast and the wind direction is East to West tonight.

136,"Large white light attached to black object flying low in skyI was driving north on US 41 in Sarasota at around 8:30pm, when I spotted a bright white light low in the sky at my 10 o’clock position that did not appear not to be moving.  This put it over Sarasota Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, depending on the distance it was from me. Much too large to be a star, my first impression was it was a low flying aircraft like when you see the landing lights of a commercial jet on approach coming towards you, it will give the appearance of it hovering.  The light in color was a bright silvery white not a yellowish white.  I figured it was a large military jet out of MacDill AFB, since commercial traffic to Sarasota/ Bradenton Airport do not come from this direction.I continued to watch it as best I could while I was driving as it really had my attention.  The sky was dark over the western horizon but not black, more of a violet hue as the sun had not been down too long.  I bring this up because as I continued to watch it I could actually make out a black shape behind the light,  I have to say I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. I rolled my window down and turned off my radio to see if I could hear an aircraft or helicopter, since I felt the object was close enough that I would be able to hear it.  There was no noise. Another thing that entered my mind was it might be a blimp or balloon, maybe some kind of promotional thing positioned over the water. All these thoughts ran through my head very quickly, maybe 15-30 seconds. As I continued to drive I would lose sight of it for a few seconds from time to time because of its low angle in the sky where buildings and trees started to obstruct my view. I thought about pulling over but there was really no place that would give me a better view. Anyone on the bay or waterfront would have had a perfect, unobstructed view. After losing sight of the object/ light for a short time, it appeared still to my left ahead of me but much closer and now at a higher angle so much so I had to peer out my driver’s window to get a good view. I was still driving North and it was clear the object/ light was indeed moving and traveling due East. It crossed over the highway slightly in front of me, almost directly over me, where I lost sight of it temporally before I could again see it from my passenger window to my right.  It continued to travel East at the same low attitude over what is a residential area. I want to point out from the time it passed over me and flew off to the East, I was only seeing the light and not the black object attached to it because that part of the sky was too dark.  Suddenly another identical light appeared to the right of it very close and level. They were close enough for me to consider both lights were attached to the same object but it had to be huge. I don’t think a KC-135 a! t 500 feet would appear that large. At the low altitude it appeared to be traveling, it was just going too slow for any jet to stay airborne. Again, I heard no sound and saw no red and green navigation lights during the whole sighting. The two white lights became very low on the horizon as they seemed to continue to travel off to the East and I eventually lost sight of them as I continued to drive North. I’m at a loss of what I could have seen. There is another sighting with a similar description that was submitted to this website that took place on the same night and time but in a town 80 miles northeast of Sarasota, Florida.

At first, I thought it was birds, but realized that they objects were too high up to be birds.  The objects began to descend.  It was then I realized that there were at least 6 or more objects.  They were square and for a second I thought they were ticker tape pieces of paper flying in the blue area of the sky.  But then they began to circle each other and move in away that made me realize it was not paper.  The color of the squares were a translucent white and reminded me of mother of pearl.

139,"Blue/purple orb seen from North Table in Golden, CO.I stepped out onto my front porch and looked into the northeast sky.  I noticed what looked like a blue/purple orb flying in a T shaped pattern.  It flew very slowly, and very directly.  When it changed direction, it did so immediately.  When it first caught my eye around 1am, it was moving to the left, then headed down.  Headed back up, then moved left again.  Stopped for a brief minute, and when it did, it became a semi-solid/pulsating randomly white light.  When it began moving again to the right, it became the blue/purple orb it had been when it first caught my eye.  After moving for a brief moment it stopped, changed to a white light again, and this is where it sat for a solid 20mins.

The person holding the phone/camera stated that two jets (likely F-16) were circling the area of approximately Covina/San Dames, Ca.

I was home with my mother and my daughter, everything was fine, until my mother and I went outside to take the dog out and heard something in the woods.  I live in a very wooded area but it's right off of a main highway.  We both heard something that sounded like 2-3 deer running but in the area that the sound came from has a very large fenced area so I don't see how this is possible....  Afterwards we both just thought that we must had misjudged the position of the sound and laughed it off.  Well my front porch has more light then the back so being that we don't smoke in the house and after hearing what we both heard we had gone to the front porch to have a smoke. We both had sat down on the front porch and we love looking at the stars, and we both had seen the same thing...  To the left of the tree line there was a very bright 3 sided shape in the sky???  It was bright enough that I had gotten up and turned the front porch light off so we could see it better.  A few minutes passed and the object then started to move very slowly, we both had thought that this was just our eyes playing tricks on us, but then it started to get brighter and moved in a way the NO plane I have ever seen moved!!!!.  We both continued to watch this object in the sky for over 30 minutes.  I actually got my phone out to record the thing and it wasn't there!!!!  At this time I'm starting to feel stupid or crazy and them my mother grabs my hand and says"" look up"" I looked up and I can not even began to explain the fear!!!!  There were 3 of the same size objects over the front of my house!!!!  Now they were not close enough to us that I felt like we were under attack but they were still there, and the original object was still not in sight.  At this point I'm getting ready to put my mother and my daughter in the car and go anywhere but here!!!!!  My mother stopped me from going in the house and points to the spot were the first object had appeared, and there it was!!!!  Now there are 4 objects in the sky and I can believe what I'm seeing, we both watched the sky for over 2-3 hours and the objects got brighter and moved and then would just disappear, but the first object was the only one that moved in such a way that I still can't believe!!!!  I have watched the x files loved the show, but this is the craziest thing I have ever seen!!!!

He stopped to finish his cigarette before walking inside and said wow look how bright the stars are tonight.  We stood looking at the stars for 30-40 seconds.  Then we saw a formation of dim lights coming from the south and heading north north west and crossed over Route 40.  The formation was almost like a chevron but without equal number of lights on each side.   There were four lights in a straight line then two more creating a kind of check mark moving across the sky.  The lights stayed in a solid formation while it was moving so we're sure it was a single craft.  It was hard to judge how high it was flying but we came to conclude it was only one to two thousand ft in the air.  It covered alot of air space very quickly and was flying at least four times faster than a typical airplane that we're used to seeing.  Also, this craft was completely silent We both ran inside to call for our stepdad to come out and by the time we looked again it was gone.

It was shaped much like an airplane, gray in color with absolutely no lights or windows that I could see.  The helicopter was again following very closely and did have its lights on.  I could clearly hear the helicopter, but the plane shaped object made no sound whatsoever.  It dawned on me then I had seen something extraordinary, that a plane could not fly that low or that slow without crashing.  I contacted Murfreesboro police who transferred my call to MTSU police to ask what was going on?  My call was returned after the person who took my call said she would try to find out what was going on.  She said she was unable to reach anyone at the MTSU airport.

174,"WWII plane about to crash into valley foothills, then appeared to turn into white orb and disappeared completelyI was sitting at my computer desk in front of a large window, facing the back yard (north/northwest) at 7:02 PM last night.  My partner and I were arguing because a brand-new, expensive hard drive had just stopped working, and lost valuable information, when suddenly it sounded like a plane was about to crash into the house. As I stood up and demanded, ""Where is that coming from?!,"" an enormous plane flew dead-center over where I had been sitting, swooping lower in front of the window and into the Ilfeld valley.  It looked (and sounded)like a World War II era plane with three engines (protrusions/turbines?) on each wing.  The entire plane was dark (black? gunmetal grey, or dark green?)  The wings were at 90* angles to the body as was the flat squarish tail.  It was less than 200 feet above where I sat, speeding north, and diving even lower in to the valley below the hilltops.  My partner ran to find a camera.  We both were screaming, ""It is going to crash!"" when next we saw it turn upside down.  We watched in shock as it pulled up vertically just before the opposing hills and did a sharp barrel roll to the right (east) like it was out of control.  Then it dove down into the hills toward the ground.  We braced for an explosion.  When there wasn't one, we both feared that it might come back towards us, but saw only a white orb/round light that then darted briefly to the left (northwest)toward the base of the foothills, where it disappeared completely.  I ran outside to watch and try to see more clearly where the plane had gone.  Nothing happened after that, but it left us in a state of excitement and completely baffled.  I'm not sure that what we heard and saw was actually a plane, which is why I am reporting it here.  If it was, it looked exactly like the old WWII bombers:  too large, low and unwieldy to do the kind of aerial maneuvers we witnessed.

181,"Silent Triangular UFO over Brandon, FloridaWe were driving south on Faulkenburg Blvd. towards home in Brandon at about 21:12 hours.  I saw what I thought was the back view of  a jumbo jet heading towards MacDill Air Force base on my right over a field.  It got my attention because it was so large and seemed so close.  There was a large white light in the center, with a small blue light on one side and another white light on the other side---as if on wing ends.  There was a small red light on the belly of it and was blinking.  However, as we got closer, we saw it definitely wasn’t moving.  So then we thought it was a tower of some kind with weird lights, but there are no towers in that area and it definitely wasn’t that, because I saw this thing rotate mid-air rather than turn.  It was definitely triangular/teardrop sort of shape---kind of both of those.  It reminded me of the jets I saw in the sixties and seventies, only a little larger. I‘ve spent a good portion of my life in and around the military, so I‘ve seen a few.  Its nose definitely pointed downwards briefly for about ten seconds or so, not really straight down, but at an angle and there was a long shaft off the nose of it.  I saw a flash of dark metal as it shifted and the definite shape.  We heard no noise whatsoever.  It appeared to sit quietly in mid-air at about eight stories up, it didn‘t seem to be much above the tree line from our point of sight from the road.  My daughter (29 years old) kept saying, “It’s so close.  What IS that?!”  My husband nearly drove off the road into the bushes because we’d gotten so excited, but he didn‘t see it because, well, he was driving.  By the time he’d turned around, it had moved in the opposite direction going North/Northwest towards Tampa International, but it had gotten really far really fast without a sound.  If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say it was some sort of stealth jet with an odd shape.  However, I have never seen a craft quietly rotate mid-air like that or head off so fast ! without a sound.

I was in the distance... Based on a thin cloud bank I would place the altitude at about 8000' so it must have been large.  I first saw it at the 10 o'clock position.  I first thought that it was sunlight on a jet contrail, but as it became larger I thought that it may be a plane on approach to the Mesa Gateway Airport... then it began to recede to the southwest... I almost wrecked the car trying to watch it.  There have got to be hundreds of witnesses, because it was very prominent... It then drifted back into the thin cloud layer and I thought it was gone, but it was bright enough to shine through...  Then from a cylinder it then appeared as two equally sized globes just touching each other...  I had to watch my driving so looked away briefly and thought it had moved away, but you could still see it behind the thin cloud... at one point it appeared to emit a curving smoke trail... then that stopped and the two globes began to sparkle... I again resumed driving.... the next time I had a chance to look up it was gone... There absolutely have to be other witnesses to this.  It was still daylight and this thing was prominently in view.  This thing was bizarre.  I checked today's local news.... nothing... but then saw a video on you-tube that showed it... Only at the point where it was two globes.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Addendum to 3/20/17 submittal regarding the 3/19/17 incident...  The cylinder was situated at a 30% tilt, higher side to the left.  Object's length was approximately 7 times its width.  US 60 runs exactly east/west... this object was at the 10 o'clock position. It was nearly sunset.  There are always contrails in the very busy skies...they were all orange and this object was silvery white.  The spheres that It turned into were pretty much the same width as the cylinder appearance, but occupied 1/4 the length of the original cylinder.  It is possible that it was two cylinders side by side that turned so as to make it appear as two spheres... just a guess.  The object stayed double-sphere in appearance until it receded to the southwest... emitted a sinuous smoke emission from the left side of the left sphere which dispersed almost immediately... the object was receding slowly... then it began to sparkle with lights brighter than the initial silvery white appear! ance…  I looked away for not more than 10 seconds...when I looked back it was no longer visible.  It is impossible than no one else saw this... as it was fairly large with an apparent width of your index finger at arms length at its narrowest and was slightly larger upon my initial observation.

My wife only witnessed the two craft  from the back just before they disappeared.  She could only discern the red lights.  She did not hear any engine sounds either, but she said if they were normal, identifiable craft, she might not have heard any sounds anyway from that distance..I spoke to my neighbor again and that is when he confirmed that he and his wife had estimated about a dozen ships flying to the east of his house.  His house is about one block from our house.  The craft never flew directly over our houses but may have moved near our area as if they came from the airport to the east of us.  The direction they were headed after we last saw them, if they stayed on that path, would have taken them directly over the city.We did not get to take any video or images.Just as the crafts dissapeared from sight, some type of passenger sized plane flew directly over our house from east to west.

At first, I thought is it a helicopter, but the light wasn't red, it was a very bright orange, about the size of a large beach ball, perfectly illuminated all the way around, solid orange color.  The orb/sphere sized light was traveling North towards my mom's house, so I rolled down my window to listen and there was no noise.  It didn't resemble a plane, helicopter, Chinese lantern, drone or a balloon and was flying level about 300 to 400 feet over the treeline.  I reversed my car back to mom's house and as I pulled up into her driveway the orb/sphere disappeared over her house/neighbor's house (I probably witnessed the orb for a total of 10 seconds).  I got mom back outside (as she has seen this orange orb several years ago and reported it on this site then) and we watched the skies for about 10 minutes and did not see a thing other than planes passing high above.  I went home and did not witness anything else on the ride home.However, nearly one hour later, mom would have a second sighting.  Mom forgot to bring and snailmail a couple of bills so she left to drop them off at the post office at around 10:25 pm.  She gets to the corner stop sign (right where I witnessed the orb an hour earlier) and sees the exact same thing coming from the east.  She stated that the bright orange light was about the size of large ball and was going from her east to the north and disappeared in the same way.  She stated that it didn't come as close as her home but was further away.  She also rolled her window down and never heard a sound.  She also stated it wasn't a balloon, plane, helicopter and she didn't think it was a drone either.  Neither one of us know what this orange light is.",Duration:6 seconds,"Location: Mandeville, LA",Occurred : 3/17/2017 21:30  (Entered as : 03/17/2017 21:30),Posted: 3/23/2017,Reported: 3/17/2017 10:10:09 PM 22:10,Shape: Sphere

259,"The objects do change from one type to another.  They appear every night; rectangular, round, long stream of lights.This is a summary of what my husband and I have witnessed and observed on our home security camera system since March 17, 2017, when we first observed a strange rectangular string of very bright lights, attached to what appeared to be a metal bar, in the southwest corner of the backyard, picked by the video on camera #7.  The string of lights appeared to be an ordinary light one would have in a shop; however, it is only visible on screen of the video recorder.  When we look outside, the lights cannot be seen with the naked eye.This summary does not address a single sighting, but is current and on-going almost nightly since April 8, 2017, when we first began to monitor and document observations of the nighttime activities, taking place around the property on a regular basis and have replayed and captured quite a few pictures and videos, documenting what we have observed today to date.Since we first began to observe closely on April 8, 2017, it has gone to another level in terms of the entire operation.  It appears that it has become an invasion of our property, now we are seeing strange creatures that cannot be described as humans as we know them.  They are very small in stature, fly in appearing as birds, brightly lit all over, and changing into circles and into small creatures with human characteristics in terms of movement, but definitely not human. When they come in they appear to be carrying out what appear to be specific  pre assigned tasks, prior to the larger equipment, consisting of very long strings of lights that appear to be controlled by something or someone to turn on and off periodically, as they approach the property.  Initially, they were coming from the trees on the west and the north sides of the house, only. Now they are coming from the southwest most of the time, and the West and North some of the time. There appears to be space ship! s and/or aircraft type objects characteristic of but different, i.e. Smaller, but able to light up a large area when they appear.  (Modes of travel) involved in the operations.  Sometimes the forerunners come in as a large brightly lighted circle or rectangular object.  From what we have observed, they come in as workers, here to do a job. They appear to be well coordinated and work in conjunction with the other objects as they come in.  As a part of the preparation, they appear to spray an unknown substance that look like snowflakes and appear to turn into hale or sleet resembling crystal flakes.  When they are in the completely screened pool area they release some type of substance into the water before the others come in.  Sometimes when it rains, we see many of something dive into the pool, which is completely enclosed, with no opening, except the locked doors. They have attempted to remove the small Weber grill from the pool area unsuccessfully.It is difficult to explain what we are personally seeing because it is monumental.  I must mention an incident that happened on May 6, 2017, at approximately 11:30PM when a laptop computer vanished from the reception room, while we were removing items from the car, which was parked right in from of the door.  The laptop was placed on a credenza inside of the reception area; it disappeared and has not been seen since.On the morning of May 29, 2017, at 5:39AM, we were seeing family off who were taking a trip in their automobile; we were in the driveway assisting them in re-arranging some of the articles in the car to make more room.  While we were outside, we did not hear or see anything or anyone, However, on replay of the video, The unidentified objects were flying all over our heads the whole time we were outside, approximately 30 minutes.I have looked for every possible logical explanation to understand what is going on.  Have researched the internet on aliens, demons, religion, witchcraft, national security, etc.   All I can explain is that the activities are very organized, comparable to an army, and there appears to be what I have determined to be the captain or director, who is always present.  Some time they appear to conduct air shows, with precision and formation.There are concerns about water and earth contamination as well as other concern.

The triangle was large and the lights were much brighter in intensity than any aircraft landing lights would have been at that distance.  I tried to t! ake a picture with my cel phone camera but the images did not register.  All of us present observed the light pattern for about 10 minutes, then one seemed to turn off.  I drove off, continuing Southward on Pacific Coast Highway towards home, and when I looked about 10 minutes later the lights were gone.  My thought was the lights may have been some type of signal flares and perhaps the Navy was conducting some sort of training or practice exercise off of the San Diego coast.  I have seen signal flares in the night sky at Camp Pendelton and they slowly descend and weaken as they drop.  These lights did not descend and were at least 10x's brighter or more than any signal flare I've seen.  I've done a couple of Google searches and couldn't find any mention or explanation.  When I came across the other report from ""the pilot"" on Mt Soledad, I realized we had observed the same lights, and decided to file this report.

It was nighttime already, clear and the object was very easy to see.  It seemed stationary for the most part, until I parked and took out my camera to film.  At this point the object began to move from a northern direction towards the west rather slowly and horizontal.  I begin filming but could tell the image was hazy on my phone and did not resemble what I was actually seeing.  I heard people talking outside, so I just stopped filming and just looked at this object.  I'll try my best to describe.  It was an orange sphere and had an orange glow.  There seemed to be like darker orange lines In the center that made either a diamond or triangle shape.  It seemed as though something was in the center.  So, as the object moved, I'm questioning what it is, etc., and it begins to fade away.  It completely fades and then becomes visible again.  It was really odd.  It continues to move and does the same thing again (fades out/in) after a couple hundred feet of movement.  By this time it flew in front my apartment and I couldnt see it.

312,"Extremely bright LED-like light over Southern California.It’s now mid-March 2017, and since mid-February I’ve seen an extremely bright light (reminds me of a huge LED tactical light) early every evening in the eastern ((sic.  western)) sky over Southern California.  It’s large enough to make a person assume that it’s close to the observer’s neighborhood, but its size and brightness make it likely to be seen by many residents living in Southern California.The light always appears around 8 p.m., sitting low in a dark sky, without any other visible stars. The light is bright in one position for approximately 30 minutes, then the light goes out, and it pops up again nearby, again parked for another 30 minutes in a new position.I first noticed it in February and, like my husband, instantly thought of Saturn.  But the light was so “artificial” and too low that I couldn’t bring myself to believe it was Saturn.  My thought was that it’s more likely a satellite or a surveillance device (drone? balloon?) possibly launched by the police, or by USGS, or by CALTRANS.  I’ve found no evidence on the Internet, but if any of these surveyors want anonymity, there wouldn’t be an announcement or explanation posted to the Internet.I believe I’ve noticed lights-out once a week (does the object need a break to re-adjust?), and then re-activated the following night for the rest of the week.I’m not certain why the foregoing surveyors would survey at night, except to avoid small aircraft from local municipal airports that would not be flying at night in the object’s altitude thereby not interfering with the object’s mission.  Large airlines flying to Ontario or to Los Angeles can be seen and are distinguishable because they move higher in the sky than does the bright light that parks low in the sky and does not move at all while lit.Thoughts rush through my mind of foreign surveillance by China, Russia, North Korea.  Could that be true?  Don’t know.  “It’s a puzzlement!”",Duration:1 hour,"Location: Redlands, CA",Occurred : 3/12/2017 20:00  (Entered as : 03/12/17 20:00),Posted: 3/17/2017,Reported: 3/13/2017 2:34:51 PM 14:34,Shape: Sphere
313,"Strange white silent hovering lights near Commencement BayWe were walking down Borough Road by Garfield Park to our car.  My daughter saw 3 hovering lights, white with red and blue and thought it was an airplane but wondered why they were silent and hovering so low, plus too small to be full sized airplanes, but very bright lights.  The group of 3 were in a tighter formation at first.  There were more bright white lights hovering lower on the horizon by the water,  Commencement Bay Puget Sound.  We notice 9 lights and actually noticed 11 in one photo, almost as though they were meeting at the spot we saw the first 3, making a formation of some kind.  I got my phone to get pictures.  They stayed bright white and spread out, then disappeared, most moved upward into the clouds, a few sideways, probably hovering for close to ten minutes.   This was about 7:45 PM, Sunday, March 12th in Tacoma, WA..  We have no idea what these were.  I'm glad we got photos.((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport,Thank you for your reply and information.  I looked at photos online of Chinese lanterns and don't believe that is what we saw as the objects seemed too mechanical and the movement seemed too deliberate but hovering rather than floaty, if that makes sense.  Plus they seemed larger than the photos of Chinese lanterns.  They were coming from the horizon.  I looked at the map for this area and noticed a Tacoma city park on the water called the Fuzhou Ting at Chinese Reconciliation Park.  I called to ask if they allow Chinese lanterns and if any were lit last night.  It seems Chinese lanterns are illegal in Seattle so I would assume most likely in Tacoma, too.  I am waiting to hear back from someone at the Parks Department to verify.  Being it is so chilly and rained earlier in the day, I doubt there were any weddings at the Fuzhou Ting Park.I am wondering if there is some kind of military goings on with the nearby JBLM.  I looked up pictures of drones but these seemed too large to be a drone, at least what photos you can find online. I also tried to reach the Tacoma Tribune but no one has replied as well as the local Fox KCPQ affiliate.  I couldn't find anything online reporting lights in the sky.  It was all very strange, we could not stop watching it.  I can't believe my Galaxy 5.6 phone was able to capture what it did since the photos are no where near the brightness and clarity of what we actually saw.  We were thinking how could you not notice this but this road is quiet and with the trees and terrain, we were in the perfect spot to see what we did.  I was hoping the Fox KCPQ might show the pictures and others might come forward if they saw it but they must not be interested.  I will submit to the online report form as soon as I get an answer from the Tacoma Parks Department about the Chinese lanterns.  The person who handles that venue is out until the 22nd so hopefully the other person I left a message with will call me back tomorrow.  I will also see if there is some way to get information from the City of Tacoma about people calling in about those lights. I looked up some videos on youtube and these lights look like what others have seen, too.    Sincerely,  ((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))Dear Peter,I did not hear back from anyone I left messages with.  However, I found an information bulletin from the Tacoma Fire Department that says there are no permits allowed for any kind of incendiary releases or sky lanterns.  I would assume a Tacoma City Park nearby would not be allowed to release lanterns.These lights that we saw look like some I found on you tube such as the ones in Missouri in 2012 and in Arlington, Texas, June 2015, in the International Business Times.  It's very strange and I also find it odd the media I tried to contact have zero interest.  You would think they would at least show the pictures to say what it is or isn't and talk about the safety of Chinese lanterns, etc... or at least verify if JBLM ((Joint Base Ft. Lewis/McChord AFB)) was doing testing of some kind or whatever they want to say it is.  I don't think it's either lanterns or drones based on what I could compare it with on the internet.

It appeared gray against the cloudy night sky and had a smooth exterior that contained detail of some kind...windows, equipment...I couldn't tell.

335,"Strange lights that moved as if an hourglass on its side, which rolled across the night sky.Between ten and eleven p.m. in the second week of March, during a crescent moon which hung in the western sky, I thought it was a perfect night for stargazing.There is a mid-sized tree in the center of our backyard which obscrued any clear view. I seen that my best bet to have the  clearest view of the night sky would be on the roof of our lean-to.After making myself comfortable,  laying on my back and hands behind my head, I had a perfectly view to the north and southeast. I was able to see clearly to the south at about 35°. The roof of our house blocked everything beneath that.  To the west, there is several thirty to forty foot trees, which were bare of leaves, but still making it too cluttered for a decent view that way.The moon was showing through those trees, and was in the sky at about 75° when I first settled in. The stars were very bright that night.  And for early March, it was very comfortable to be outside.  Completely still, no wind whatsoever.I had probably been stargazing between 45-minutes to an hour.  The moon loomed at 30° in the western sky. Four dim white lights coming from direct south on a straight northern route, flew right over the house.  They passed directly above me as I lay on top the roof of the lean-to.  The Orion constellation was to the southeast, which was my focus at that moment and my clearest view of the sky.The lights cought my attention the moment they appeared over the roof of the house. I'm guessing within a quarter mile or so south of the house.  The four lights were dim, white, and appearing to be two seperate objects moving at a fairly quick pace and very close to each other like in a wingman formation.I have no idea how the objects were shaped.  Nor even trying to imagine how they might look! Because the way these lights moved across the sky had me, not only jumping with joy as I knew I was seeing a bonified UFO, but also left me completely baffled as to how they could possibly have looked.I could, however, see that each object had two lights which I am sure were each set on either side of the object.  I'm guessing the objects were only a few thousand feet from the ground, and by the distance  the lights were apart from each other.  The objects were likely the size of a small plane.  Maybe even as small as a car or truck. But it was the way they moved across the sky that has left me clueless.As the objects passed overhead there was not a sound.  All I could see were the four lights. I knew it had to have been two objects, each with a pair of lights. Imagine holding a dim light in each hand.  Arms outstretched horizontally&#8203;.  Now move your arms in a rolling motion.  As the left side rolls forward, the right side rolls opposite.  As if in the shape of an hourglass  rolling on its side.  Only it wouldn't be shaped like an hourglass. Its just the only thing I can think in comparison.The event lasted no more than ten seconds.  It was very dark that night, and I was able to keep my sights on the lights until they passed beyond the horizon, which was only a couple miles to the north because they were at such a low altitude.I googled the description of what I seen of the object and the way in which it moved, but was not able to find anything that seemed similar.  I did, however, come across this website, and thought by posting my account in the most detail I can give.  Maybe someone else has seen a similar object and can share with how the object possibly looks.  I'm intrigued.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

357,"Two witnesses watched winged aircraft  with no tail or landing gear stay motionless for some time at the edge of the road.Heading north on Route 5 from Waldorf, and just entering the Clinton, Maryland, area, the craft was spotted to the right of the roadway.  It was sitting at approximately 400-500 feet from the roadway and was at at an altitude for from between 300-500 feet.  The craft resembled an airplane or a drone.  The color was silver/brushed gray.  It was the size of a small, early jet airliner perhaps 75-100 feet long.  The shape was that of a cylinder, rounded at both ends with the front portion being somewhat bulbous and slightly larger than the rear.  Two long wings came out from the sides, under the aircraft, and did not appear to be affixed, but gave the impression that they were part of the fuselage as if the whole thing were built as one.  The wings were chopped off at the ends, similar to what was on the old X-15 experimental aircraft, except that they were longer.  The craft had no markings and no markings.  What struck us odd was that it had no tail or landing gear of any sort.  It just remained motionless and hung there.  It did not sway or move in anyway and gave off no noise or light.  It was a sunny and perfect day weather-wise.  We watched the craft through the front and side windows of the car for about 30 or more seconds.  Just as we took our eyes off of it to make a right into Southern Maryland Hospital so that we could get out to get a better look, it simply vanished without a trace.  Traffic was heavy and we have no idea of anyone else saw what we saw.  We could not agree on what it was.  It was in what would have been the flight path for Andrews AFB, and felt that the thing was probably heading there.  However, the fact that it did not move or ""fly"" in anyway, had no tail or landing gear was highly strange.  It looked out of place and did not appear to be any sort of aircraft that we were familiar with.",Duration:40 seconds,"Location: Clinton, MD",Occurred : 3/9/2017 15:30  (Entered as : 03/09/17 15:30),Posted: 3/23/2017,Reported: 3/19/2017 5:32:58 PM 17:32,Shape: Other

360,"1 hour Vestavia Al UFO sighting shape shifting reddish colorLooking at stars, noticed slightly off color yellow/orange tint- distinctly different.  Emitted a pulsating light and would go from a distinct star like dot to a chevron, went from pin point light to chevron changing with pulses to a fainter much less intense yet larger oval transparent light which would blip and fade away- but it kept coming back into view.  I kept comparing it to the stars to convince my self it was different and it definitely was.  The most interesting feature was the way it moved, it seemed to pulsate to the point it seemed as if it was shaking and it would distinctly move west to east, south to north, at times it would move in semi circles, then hover in a semi Circle or crescent.  It would intensify to a dot and left right up down but stayed within the rectangular view of my iPhone 7+ on video.  Oh yes- I have about 10 minutes or more of video and photos.  The photos on the iPhone r shot in 3 second moving intervals.  I got pics of the intense dot, the larger vapor like semi transparent glow and I even got several vapor like streaks with the camera- something I did not see with my eyes, but the camera picked it up.  This thing would appear, move about in eradicating movements, fade in, fade out, go from the intense dot to the larger semi transparent glowing circle or oval, etc.  This went on from about 3:30 am to 4:10 or so.

388,"A bright light that  was stationary, then split into 2 lights, and faded away.Talking with friend on outside kitchen steps and was discussing how many planes fly over at this time of day, from roughly East to West.(I have an App on my IPad showing their departure and arrival times and speed and altitude, called ""Plane Finder"".)  I was telling him most of these were flying anywhere from 30 to 40 thousand feet and often times they were starting their decent over us, depending on their destination.Anyways; I looked up at one of these planes that was just beyond overhead and flying West and saw a very bright light that was in back of it, yet at a much lower altitude, so I could perceive.  This light was not moving.  The sun was overhead also, although positioned slightly southwest and more westerly than the plane.The light looked like a light from a very bright flashlight. I asked  my friend. ""what's that light?"" He had to turn, He was facing North.  He looked and as we both saw it, it split into 2 lights (splitting from East to West) not too far apart and then gradually faded away.We could not determine the distance to this light, although I would guesstimate from 1/2 to a mile, although I am guessing more than I actually know.When it started to split, I rubbed my eyes, not knowing what I was seeing, thinking that I was seeing something that was not there.  It was there.The time I saw this light until it started to split was about 8 to 10 seconds, how long it was there, I have no idea.The time it took from when it started splitting was about 10 seconds, before it faded away.The distance between the 2 lights, after they split was about 5 to 7 times the width of the original one bright light.For example if the original light was say five feet wide (it appeared round), the split lights were roughly 25 to 40 feet apart.  This measurement seems to be an interpretation of possibly the height of this light, in my mind, not sure??  It was very bright, so much so, that even with the sun shining on us from a more southeasterly direction, it was as bright, if not brighter but much smaller.I only wish that I could have had a better perception of its altitude or distance from us.What did we see?",Duration:20 second,"Location: Lisbon, ME",Occurred : 3/6/2017 12:15  (Entered as : 03/06/17 12:15),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 3/7/2017 6:07:06 AM 06:07,Shape: Fireball

395,"3 white spheres drifting, twirling, and zooming out of sightMy wife and I arrived at my mother´s house in Honeybrook, Pa, around 1:30 pm for a family get together.  I scanned the skies to check for signs of geoengineering.  I noticed two commercial airplanes flying west, laying down contrails that dissipated pretty quickly at what appeared to be cruising altitude.  At this point I noticed what appeared to be three white birds flying (drifting) around in circles, almost like they were drifting around in the air currents.  These three white “birds” appeared to be at a similar altitude to the two planes I had been observing.  I quickly realized that birds don´t fly at that altitude, and if they did I wouldn´t be able to see them with the naked eye.  I pointed it out to my wife to see what her opinion was.  She had a hard time seeing what I was asking her to look at, but when she could finally see them she said they were round, white balls—difficult to see.  I, too, saw that they were round, white balls flying around erra! tically, like the way a bird of prey might drift around in the air.  One of the three objects disappeared, while the other two continued flying west.  They twirled around each other in a spiral pattern while zipping west at a very fast pace.  No emissions or noise was observed from these two circular ball objects.  We both realized that these objects were strange, nothing that we have seen before in the skies.  UFO’s?

It was enough to shake my house, and also several of my neighbors went outside to see what was going on. I didn't actually see the helicopter, but my neighbor said that it ""had a big spotlight on it"" and looked like it was looking at the power lines on our street and then it flew off.  Several seconds later, I yelled up the street to my closest neighbor and said ""what the _____ was that?""  And he replied he didn't know what was going on.I went back inside for a few moments and figured it was a search helicopter or Lifelight (we have snowmobile trails here and several people become injured or lost) and I figured maybe that's what was going on.  We have had helicopters flying low before looking for marijuana but it's the dead of winter and I'd highly doubt that was the cause.Anyway I went outside to see if the helicopter was going to make a circle back. I heard the sound of a plane off in the distance, went to my backyard and saw 3-4 aircraft off toward Borestone Mountain which is about 10 miles away.  They appeared to be either jets or helicopters.  As it was night time I could only make out the lights and that they were moving ""left to right"".  At that moment I was pretty sure something had happened and decided to call the sheriff's department and notified them of what was happening.  They said that they had ""no reports"" of Lifelight or any other aircraft (from an emergency standpoint) in the area.  The dispatcher on the phone said ""you are the only person to call in about it TONIGHT.""  I asked, ""has this happened before?"".  She said that she had had reports in the past of aircraft in the Monson area and low-flying helicopters as recently as a week ago.  I didn't give them my name but told them in general where I live as I didn't want to sound crazy.  I then went to the store and talked to a clerk who had said she saw the helicopter. Another friend across town also mentioned on Facebook she thought the ""helicopter was going to land on her house.""

It is pretty windy here tonight, and the cloud DID NOT move.  It seemed to be like a trail and it was going in the direction of the mountain I had previously mentioned.  I showed my neighbor who remarked the cloud looked weird - the moon lit it up in the dark. It is a clear night and very cold with wind.I am just wondering if it was perhaps a military exercise or there was some kind of incident like a UFO, maybe something crashed?  I live in rural Maine and although we get military planes occasionally it is below zero and I doubt any training would be going on - especially so close to the ground.

414,"Bone-rattling sonic boom like noise that did not ""fly by,"" but ascended directly upward, no visible craft seen.I was on the peak of a one story house roofing, when I heard what seemed like a sonic boom—something, living in Alaska, I have only experienced maybe 2 times…  But I remember  distinctly experiencing the first as a child and how it lead me to ask/learn about the speed of sound, etc., after hearing a massive jet fly over, yet looking up to see the only aircraft in the sky was already far far past me..So on this super chilly yet beautiful BLUEBIRD, (literally not a single cloud visible in the sky) sunny day, I was sitting on the peak of the roof and as with a sonic boom, this out of nowhere, thunder-like BOOMING began so I started to scour the sky for the plane.There is a very small municipal airport nearby, so watching the various and at times quite suspicious types of helicopters/planes that come and go, is something I actively do as we work.As the INTENSE sounds continued it was immediately obvious that the sound was not “flying by” but instead was isolated almost directly above me, a little more towards the north east though.It was if a rocket was taking off above my head but that it was either sooooooooo far up that my (extremely excellent) eyes were unable to see it or that whatever it was, was COMPLETELY invisible.  I have read the unaided human eye can see a candle flame from 30 miles soooo, whatever was producing the noise was not reflecting light, was behind a barrier or was projecting its sound ""angularly"" by bouncing it off of a barrier.It was SO LOUD that it literally rattled my bones with cracking and booming, freaking me ((deleted)) out.Another way to describe how the whole thing felt is like the blue of the sky was the surface of water, and I couldn’t see up into it, but right on the other side of the surface was an enormous turbine propeller that literally tore its vessel away with power resulting in what sounded like a sheet of tin, as big as the sky around me, being shaken over and over and over  --like you do with sheet to make a bed..I searched the sky for any movement- for minutes even after the sound ended.Looking in every direction over and over, closing my eyes a time or two because of the intensity of the sunlight and trying to make sure my eyes combined with the immense field of BLUE NOTHINGNESS, didn’t start playing tricks on me..Picture me like some freaking crazy-ass, paranoid tweaker, sitting on top of a roof,  in -15F, doing a methodical but semi frantic 360 scan of an empty sky, over and over.... Ohhh how I HOPE someone saw it hahaha There were no planes, birds , clouds, wind--- NOTHING.The noise was of seemed an invisible craft ascending straight up, directly away from the earth until it could not be heard from the ground any longer.I have seen the videos of crafts with chameleon abilities but with those, there were objects and clouds around/behind them so it seemed their movement and outlines were visible.There was nothing but the stop-you-in-your-tracks noise and the nearly impossible-to-describe blue of an Alaskan sky on a below zero, sunny day.I have had two unidentified sightings before this.  The first in late Dec 2013 shared with another witness that was reported—which shared someone else’s similar report on the same day/area on NUFO, and the second not reported from winter of 2015.I wish i had thought to record the sky to see if something was caught... oh well  ........To me it is insanely humorous how people are told not to believe & neglect their own eyes/hears/senses in general, and how most are willing to ‘accept’ some second hand information or “knowledge” from a complete strangers mouth-- from some device or screen of which they have not even the most basic understanding of its workings, nonetheless!((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The first object appeared then traveled SE in direction.  Folliwed by a secind that just appeared from nowhere.  At one point they stopped and just stayed there illuminating the sky.  However these objects had no blinking lights like aircraft do. Also just to ket you know there was plenty of planes that were in the area.  Around the Deer Valley Airport to be specific.  Now I know other aircraft spotted these objects and I know for certain the tower had recieved radio contact from many of the planes.  In regards to what was in the sky they were seeing?

451,"A very bright light (brighter than the stars) suspended at an altitude higher than Cheyenne Mountain below it.I left my home to retrieve some chewing tobacco from my truck parked in the street in front of my house.  I looked west towards Fort Carson and noticed a very bright light in the sky that I have never seen before.  At first I though it was a helicopter due to its location over an Army installation.  I ruled that notion out due to the lack of blinking lights and the lack of noise.  The craft was perfectly still (didn't weave or bob like a hovering helicopter).  My second thought was that it might be a commercial airplane due to an airport being nearby my location.  But again the lack of lights, noise, and movement ruled that out for me.  In a stroke of luck an airplane happened to be flying at lower altitude in the same direction and provided an outstanding visual reference.  I went back into my house to retrieve my roommate to ensure I wasn't seeing things.  He confirmed that he too saw something strange.  The object to appeared to be in the shape of a cross.  The cro! ss appeared to have been in the shape of two intersecting ovals instead of two linear components.  The horizontal part appeared to have been red in color.  The vertical part was two colors.

I could not determine the color, though the other witness said it was green.  It moved in a circular pattern at high speed.  As far as we could tell, its height above the ground was slightly higher or equal to the height of Denny Chimes Tower, 115 feet.After a few minutes, as I trained my eyes to follow the shape as it moved, I thought that it was bobbing up and down a little as it moved, much in the same way as a bird flaps its wings.The other witness talked about recent social media reports at the Quad about sightings of Mothman, but I have not seen these reports.  I speculated whether it was search lights to warn aircraft of their low altitudes, or water from the sprinklers refracting off the street lights in the clouds.After several sprinklers turned off, the object was still there circling.The other witness approached 2 girls to ask if they saw it, and they did.We also asked a man passing by if he saw the object, bringing witness count to 5.

462,"Bright light (definitely NOT the ISS) observed shortly before a flyover by the ISSI went outside to observe a flyover of the ISS which was scheduled to pass almost directly overhead at 9:20pm local time from NW to SE.  At approximately 9:15pm I observed a light similar in brightness to the ISS but north of my location.  After observing the light for a few seconds I realised it could not be the ISS: it was flying in the wrong direction (nearly west to east) and was too far north.  The light also appeared to change direction a couple of times but this may have just been an illusion created by the atmosphere.After checking the Heavens Above website, I was able to confirm the ISS was not yet visible from my location so I returned to watching the object.  Soon after, I went back outside the light abruptly vanished.A few minutes later I observed another bright light NW of my location and, after watching for a short time (and checking the Heavens Above website again) I was able to confirm this second object was the ISS.  I watched the ISS for several minutes until it dropped below the horizon.The unexplained light I observed was first seen roughly north of my location and was in sight for about a minute.  I think it was at a very high altitide although I have no way of knowing for certain. It disappeared after travelling across about 20 degrees of the sky reaching a position roughly NE.  Angle above the horizon started at about 75 degrees and finished about 60-65 degrees above the horizon.Weather at the time was moderate wind (about 25km/h) from SE.  Sky was mostly clear - no clouds around where the light was observed.  Many stars visible but no moon.At no point was any sound heard nor were any changes of colour or brightness noted before its disappaerence.  It was a steady, bright white light.Personal info.

486,"Followed Large bright white object while driving for over an hour.	I’m a truck driver who drives almost weekly drives up and down the Alaska Highway in Canada and on the night of Saturday February 25th, I had a very strange experience/sighting driving north on the Alaska Highway as I was approaching the BC/Yukon border.	When climbing a small hill, the corner of my eye caught an object giving off a very large white light, I would say in the sky it looked like a tennis ball compared to the other stars in the sky and what made me take notice is that appeared to be falling from the sky much like a meteorite.  I became a bit worried and actually almost made a full stop on the highway because it looked like this thing was going to fall into the hood of my truck.  As I was close to coming to a full stop, this object changed its trajectory from dropping down, to moving forward, so I sped back up to highway speed and watched this object  as best as I could while driving up the highway.It would constantly move at a slow but steady speed from my left to my right and lower itself and be near the tree tops of the forest.  Almost every time I got close to going downhill to a creek crossing the craft would do this, and I would lose sight of it from going to the bottom of the valley, and when I climbed back up in the truck to the hill top, the craft is back to my left and the same process repeated itself about half a dozen times of being to my left, rising and lowering itself then slowly drift over to my right and drop to the tree tops, almost like it was going to land.  It maneuvered a lot like a helicopter but there were no flashing lights, it was just a solid large bright white light and everything was silent, and if near a helicopter, the sound would’ve been so loud you could feel the vibrations from the sound of its motor.I followed the light for over 80km and reached a rest stop area about 10km from a town called Watson Lake, just inside the Yukon.  I pulled into the rest stop with the idea of stopping and getting out of my truck to try to listen for any sounds.  The rest stop is on a bit of a mountain ledge and when I pulled my rig in and stopped, the craft was out in the valley lowered and it was at eye level!!!  As quick as I could I opened the door and stepped down to the ground, and by the time I turned back to look in the valley, it had vanished.  I heard no sounds at all, and the time it took me to step out of the truck and turn to look out only took 2 seconds, if that and this craft was gone.",Duration:1 hour +,"Location: Watson Lake (Canada), YT",Occurred : 2/25/2017 21:00  (Entered as : 02/25/17 21:00),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 2/28/2017 2:18:21 PM 14:18,Shape: Light

They were also orange and appeared to be flying in a triangle type formation.  One was in the lead and 2 were following.  I started videoing them with my cellphone.  They also appeared to travel north to south before disappearing.   We observed them for approximately 5 minutes.   The final one (we saw 5 total) lasted about 30 seconds and was also orange in color.  It also travelled north to south, then veered sharply west before disappearing.My initial reaction to the first one was it was a helicopter or drone.  Then I thought maybe the lights we saw were chinese lanterns.  It should also be noted that our cellphone batteries drained approximately 20% during this encounter which lasted approximately 15 minutes total.  I am prior military and law enforcement officer and have never seen lights like these before.There is an anomaly in the video that is a white light that dances around.

I looked again at the drawing I made soon after seeing the objects and while they didn't appear to be Chinese lanterns, it is possible that at the right height and right angle maybe they could be.  The thing that throws me off is that I remember when I saw them I thought they were way too big to be drones - even really, really large drones.   The next morning I googled drones and thought that maybe the drones that are large enough to carry one person might be large enough to match what I saw hence ""car sized"" or ""small car sized"".   I never did see any of them rise rapidly in the sky and disappear.   They all maintained the exact height and distribution pattern the entire time I watched them move off to the NE until they were just small orange/red objects.  It was not windy that night.

As I stopped at the intersection of W. 11th, looking southward, I saw a strange object moving above the roof tops near the intersection of Kohl St. and W. 10th Avenue, a block away.The object was a solid and somewhat irregularly shaped teardrop that was horizontal and heading at an even level and speed towards the east.  It was a gunmetal gray color.  The plumper part of the object was to the east and the sharper point to the west.  It was smooth, but on the east end, the shape had a slightly squared edge on the top rim.  The bottom of it seemed flat.  I wondered if it were a drone, but it had no protruding parts, such as propellers or wings.  I am estimating that this object was about two feet long and two and a half feet at the widest point.There was no traffic, so I turned east on W. 11th and kept looking at it as it arced northeast above the houses on the next street.  I turned down that street, but it flew beyond the street and disappeared from view.The wind was pretty strong from the northwest at that time.  If it had been debris, I believe it would have tumbled and pirouetted in the sky, taking on irregular shapes.  Instead, it remained in the same shape, and it moved in a completely even trajectory, at a steady altitude, and at a steady pace.  I do not believe this was debris caught in the wind.

As i was fishing at my local reservoir, I noticed the sky was very clear except for a few misty clouds.  About 8:30pm something caught my eye and I saw these two white lights moving in a cloud.  They were moving in circles but in oposite directions.  One counter clock ways and the other clock ways.  Some times one would make bigger loops and then back to a tight circle.  I watched them for 30 mins or so and then they were just gone.  I returned home and looked up what I had saw and way amazed how many people have reported the same thing so I wanted to report it.

508,"February 24, 2017 - Approximately 20:30 -  I was traveling from Santa Fe, NM to Albuquerque, NM.  While getting into my vehicle, I notice a large light high up in the sky that I thought was the Planet Jupiter, although I thought that it appeared to be 3 to 4 times larger than what I am used to observing from my home in Albuquerque.  As I began driving, I noticed that the object appeared to be shimmering and changing from a golden color to a light shade of red or pinkish orange.  After I had traveled approximately 3 miles, I noticed that the object appeared to be increasing in size.  As I passed the La Cienega exit the object had doubled in size and now appeared to be near the size of a street light and the colors became more vibrant.  The object was gradually  losing altitude and traveling in roughly the same direction as Interstate 25 (from north to south), and appeared to be moving slightly inward toward the interstate.  It became obvious that this was not a commercial aircraft as it appeared to be within a distance of less than 3-5 miles from my location and the object appeared to be at least as big as 2 to 3 airliners.  There were not any other lights on the craft, and no definite shape could be seen due to the brightness of the light the object was emitting.  At this point the object appeared to be at half the altitude it was at when I first observed it, I would estimate somewhere between 3000ft. to 5000ft.It was at this time that I brought the object to my passengers attention.  She observed the object for the next couple of minutes, stating in agreeance   that the object was not a plane and that is was descending toward the earth at a steady rate.   As I reached the Cochiti Exit I noticed that the object was now at about ¼ of the original height, and we agreed it was flying somewhere between the Cochiti Pueblo and Interstate-25.  My passenger was attempting to take a picture as we were approaching the Budaghers exit but was having difficulties focusing on the objects as we were traveling at highway speeds.  Around a mile before the Budaghers exit, the object appeared to begin moving west and away from the highway.  I decided that I would exit at the Budaghers off-ramp and attempt to get a few pictures or videos.  As I was exiting the off-ramp the object was visible until I had my vehicle almost pointing in its direction of travel.  The object “blinked out” and was no l! onger visible.  I stopped and continued to observe the sky in this area for another five minutes and never observed the object again.  The event occurred over a period of twenty minutes, and a distance of at least twenty-five miles. As I returned to Interstate 25 and drove south toward Albuquerque I noticed two military helicopters to the far southeast, near the backside of the Sandia Mountains.  I live in an area of Albuquerque where Blackhawk helicopters often fly near my home when they are performing training exercises so identifying the helicopters was not difficult.   I also want to note that the object appeared to begin moving in a westward direction at the time my passenger took her first picture with the flash turned on, on her camera phone.  I also thought I would mention that there are radio towers everywhere in the area and the light of the object was much larger that the lights on the towers.  This all may be coincidence but interesting none the less.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Santa Fe, NM",Occurred : 2/24/2017 20:30  (Entered as : 02/24/2017 20:30),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 2/24/2017 11:15:17 PM 23:15,Shape: Fireball

It was very loud and sounded quite low.  We are near the normal flight path for Life Flight helicopters coming from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire so that was my initial assumption.  However, the noise was so intense, I went out onto my back deck to take a look.My deck has a panoramic view of the Bennington valley.  I looked east and saw the aviation strobe lights of the copter as it came over the tree tops across the street.  Then I noticed two bright, white points of light about 300 feet in front of the helicopter.  They were separated by about 50 feet from each other.  They were solid lights with no blinking, fading or strobing.  The tri kept a steady pace as they flew over the valley.  The two lights never changed their path, elevation or distance from one another.As they approached the mountains to the west, I suddenly noticed two other helicopters about a half mile to the north tracking in the same direction.  They were about 200 feet apart and kept pace with the other three aircraft.

519,"02/23/2017:  2 bright light sightings in Hiram, Georgia, Paulding County along 92 east between 8:30 - 9 PM.UFO Sighting: 2 lights moving  It was Thursday, February 23, 2017, about 8:30 PM driving home from bible study, about a 15 minute drive home with my three minor children and my friend.  As I turned right off the Douglas-Hiram road, route 92, I noticed two moving objects with bright lights that just moved horizontal across the sky.  They were not close together but distanced apart but moving at the same level across the sky.  I said something to my friend.  She then saw them as did my children.As I drove along we all watched.  I turned into my subdivision and onward to my house in the cul-de-sac.Trees blocked my view into my subdivision to my first left turn up to my right turn onto my street.  Just at the intersecting streets, the view was clear.  We could still see these two bright lighted sightings just gliding across the sky at the same eye level and same distance apart.  The two lighted sightings didn't seem to be very high in the sky but distance enough to just see the lights which appeared to be linear horizontals.  We watched as long as we could on the tree lined street into my cul-de-sac before I reached my garage.I am not sure if this was reported by others, and we did research the Internet to see if anyone reported this.  I just really find this strange.I myself have witnessed three UFO sightings in Baltimore, Maryland in the summer during the late 60s and early 70s.  Those sightings were witnessed by several people where the sightings just seem to be suspended mid air about I'd say about 400 feet off the ground having what appeared to be lights circling the flying object having flown very close to our community recreation center viewed through the paneled windows some 22 feet from the floor.  At that time, 20 plus people saw this on movie night.  The sighting ended over the field on an elementary school property, Bentalou Elementary, to be exact.  I would see two other sightings from my home on Lexington Street, Baltimore, Maryland.  I say this to say, I believe there are UFOs which makes me sensitive, alert and observant to anything flying in the sky.

540,I was watching tv earlier on this evening roughly after 8pm or 830 pm.  I all of a sudden caught a glare from the corner of my eye a light.  When I only had the lights on the upper level and not the lower set.  I walk to the lower level and I saw what looked like I though a meteor heading towards me.  At least that's what I could explain it.I tried to look through the telescope but because they are uva treated ect.  I couldn't get any thing.  I am on the south side of bowen Island and it was before vancouver island.  On the left side between smaller islands.  This was changing color.  I took out a set of binocolars and went outside.  To my amazement when I looked through my binocolars this was not a round shape as I thought but egg shaped and covered with thousand of what I though lights.  This was stationary in the air but my hands were very shaky.  It was like a breathing thing.  In the sense there was another one on another angle but to the up right angle higher up and that the lights of the ship would otherwise completely light up or only a portion of it.  The other one would also have completly different pattern.  I did get my video cam out and only got one of the crafts on it.

549,"Defined Bright Glowing Red Orange Sphere or Fireball Seen Traveling (Or Landing?) ESE from Marietta, OHOn the night of Tuesday, Feb. 21st, 2017, about 10:45 P.M. Returning home from work, I saw a defined sphere/globe, bright glowing red orange ball appear apparently out of the cloud cover above (no stars were visible) and then traveling, almost downward, about as fast as a speedy jet liner disappearing over tree covered horizon toward east southeast as I was traveling down Acme Street in Marietta, Ohio.At first, I thought that it might simply be a reflection of a sodium street lamp on Acme Street appearing on my wind screen or one of the large area lights on one of several tall masts near the Interstate 77 interchange with Ohio SR 7/Pike St., only a hundred yards from the opening of Acme Street.  (No way one of these disappeared below the horizon, since you drive under them going through the interchange.)  However, continuing to observe the light as I traveled toward Pike Street the light continued in a fashion matching the speed of a fast jet plane, low, and eventually disappearing over the horizon. It did not seem to get much smaller than when I first saw it appear.  This object did not appear like 'fire' nor did it have a tail of any sort.  The object was close enough  that my palm on an outstretched arm would have covered it up neatly.  The light appeared as a well defined sphere or globe and never changed direction, indeed, almost as if it were coming down instead of going further.  This sighting lasted less than two minutes.There is an airport due south of Marietta, OH, across the river in Wood County (Gill-Robb Wilson Air Field/Wood Cty. Airport), where a West Virginia ANG Unit operates.  However, this light appeared to go past that direction, and did not appear to have any features matching a plane or helicopter.  There were no flashing lights or landing gear lights.I am a casual observer of the sky and have a decent knowledge of what planes look like in the day and night.  My son is an amateur astronomer and so some of that knowledge has come in handy knowing the difference of planets, stars, and other common aerial phenomena.  This was nothing like I'd ever seen before, as it was cloudy and the ball of light was under the cloud ceiling (which in my sons opinion rules out Jupiter, for instance, which was shining in the east—or a comet or meteor) and to my knowledge, any air craft (or phenomena) I've ever laid eyes upon.",Duration:<2 minutes,"Location: Marietta, OH",Occurred : 2/21/2017 22:45  (Entered as : 02/21/17 22:45),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 2/24/2017 1:50:32 PM 13:50,Shape: Fireball

I was on a class trip from Chicago to D.C., and upon our arrival home back to Chicago at 8:11 P.M. is when I saw it, at first it was simply a couple of lights moving ever so slightly fading in and out but then more lights arrived towards the right side of my window.

There is no sound in the video and this may be because my headphones were plugged in at the time because I was watching a downloaded television series.

However, as I drove out of sight, the houses were blocking my view, I noticed the lights seeming to move away from the water.  As I rounded the corner towards the intersection, I saw the craft cross the intersection several hundred feet ahead of me.

I observed a bright light in the sky.  I couldn’t see too many stars if at all between the light pollution of the town and the cloudy sky.  I was watching the light as best I could because it was unusually bright considering the circumstances.  After approximately 45 to 60 seconds the light that appeared to be at a standstill.  And then the light appeared to be making a vertical drop as if it was falling to the ground at an alarming rate of speed.  Originally it appeared to be a few miles above the ground and dropped to maybe a few hundred yards.  (approximately)  After it reached to appear to be a few hundred yards above the ground, it came to a stop and appeared to be hovering.  At this point, I was coming up to exit 17 of 81 north, when the object began to move again, going towards my left, and appearing to make a movement towards the north east of my position.  It made a complete stop again for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, then in an instant, took off at an incredible rate of speed appearing to make a north-western direction from my position, gaining a slight amount of altitude, then it was just gone in a flash.   At this point I was approximately half a mile past exit 17 of 81 north.  It lasted only about 2 minutes.  At first, I was not sure what to think because I have never seen anything like this.  Chambersburg is not far from Washington, D.C., and we have multiple military bases in and around our area.  I have seen many military aircraft in our skies, but nothing anything close to this.

574,"Bright circular shapes changing colors and moving around the sky.I know this is going to sound crazy... it sounds crazy even as I type it.  But, I'm sure that you've heard it all.  I swear to you that this is not a hoax or some psycho bullshit.  I am a VP of Communications for a bank and I never truly believed in UFOs until my best friend and roommate showed me the video she took last night on my camera.  Last weekend, I saw something strange in the sky, but quickly blew it off because I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. It was stationary... it looked like a very bright star, but every once awhile it looked like it was changing color and glowing a bit red.  I asked my friend at the time... do you see that?  Is it my eyes?  Does that star look like it's glowing red?  She dismissed it pretty quickly and said, ""Maybe it's Jupiter.  Sometimes you can see Jupiter in the night sky.""  Okay.  Sounded plausible to me.  So, I stopped looking, continued to enjoy the fire in our firepit in our backyard and didn't think about i! t again.Well, last night, I wasn't feeling well, so I went to bed early.  My friend had one of our other friends over for company and they were out back at the firepit.  They were looking at the night sky and commenting on how pretty it was because it was so clear and they could see so many stars.  It was then that they saw a bright glowing object that was moving in an odd way.  They continued to stare at it and realized that it definitely wasn't a star.  It also was not a plane. It looked like it was changing shape slightly and it would get very bright, then start to dim and they could also see the faint changes in color.She ran into the house to grab my camera. I have an expensive Canon camera that will zoom in 80x. It also takes video.  When she zoomed in and started the video, she could not believe what she was seeing.  And neither could I.  I am still stunned as I type this. It's so hard to describe without you seeing it (we are trying to figure out how to download it from the camera and upload onto YouTube), but the circular light would start to flash colors that weren't visible to the naked eye... you could only see it through the camera lense when it was magnified. It would flash colors and then look like it explodes - or radiates out - dissipates and then forms back into a bright circular light.  Almost like some sort of strange emanating force-field or something.  It would also move straight up, back down, to the right, the left, etc.  It's the most amazing and strangest thing I've ever seen in my life.  She caught several of them on camera last night.She and our other friend started looking early this morning online to see if there were other sightings and they only found one mention... oddly enough, it was happening at the same exact time they made their first sighting.  The videos are posted on YouTube from a family in Washington state.  You can clearly hear how shocked they were to be seeing what they were seeing.  I think they were taking their video from a cell phone and couldn't zoom in nearly as close as we could, so you could see the same type of circular bright light, some of the faint colors, and see it moving, but you couldn't see that weird emanating force-field thing that we experienced.  But, other than that, it looked like the same type of thing we were witnessing.  This couple (and their child) were seeing the same thing at the same time in Washington that we were experiencing right here in New Jersey.I swear to you this is a not a joke and we have something really incredible on video tape. We need to figure out a way to get it to you... and we also wanted to ask if you knew of any reputable places that could analyze it.  We hesitate to send it to NASA after our research today - especially since apparently last night, they cut their live satellite feed when six unidentified objects flew past it.  So, why would they cut the feed? This is all just too strange. And, like I said, I know it sounds crazy.  But, I know I'm not crazy. I know what I'm seeing on my own camera and I know what my best friend is telling me that she saw with her own eyes and I believe her.  Our friend who was over works for the Department of Agriculture for the State of NJ and he couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had never seen anything like it in his entire life and said that he's going to be researching it today with whoever will listen to him and talk to him about it.All I know is that we saw something.... something that definitely is NOT from this Earth, I can guarantee you that.",Duration:3 hours,"Location: Lindenwold, NJ",Occurred : 2/19/2017 23:00  (Entered as : 02/19/17 23:00),Posted: 2/22/2017,Reported: 2/20/2017 2:00:02 PM 14:00,Shape: Changing

585,"Brilliantly-lit fire-colored, slow-moving object, with blue-green efflux.This is the first time in my life that I've reported a sky-borne object sighting.  Because it was in the western sky, some people will think ""oh, Venus"" - fine.  I'm not an astronomer, but I've spent many a starry, planety night gazing at this sky from my hot tub, and have never seen anything like this.  Tonight I had just stepped out onto my back deck, and this brilliant ""fire in the sky"" caught my eye, so I paused to watch it.  It was higher than local planes fly, but seemingly lower than the cruising altitude of a international jet.  It was moving slowly in the way that satellites do ... I always have fun looking for satellites in the sky because they're more-common to spot than shooting stars.  But this was lower than a satellite.  It was BRIGHT ... so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look directly at it, but it was so fascinating that I made myself look anyway.  The color of the object itself was yellow-orange, nearly exactly like fire, but the light coming from it towards the earth was a white light, which did not seem to be ""panning"" or searching ... it just seemed to be emanating.  There was no flickering or blinking. In addition, there were a few shafts of brilliant blue-green light coming from behind it as the object slowly travelled toward me (from west to east).  These almost neon blue-green rays were nearly obscured by the bright orange body of the object itself, but were colore! d so intensely that if you stared at it, you could clearly see them.  If one were to speculate, one might think that they would appear as they did if they were part of a propulsion system. The object made no sound.  It was fairly high in the sky, at about 65 degrees.  Its path of direction was not constant, as a standard satellite's would be.  It slowly tracked closer to my home (a rural area, with few houses), then it seemed to stabilize its location.  I went inside to do some internet searching of such phenomena, looked out the window about 10 minutes later and it seemed a bit further away to the west, and about a half hour after my initial sighting, I looked, and it was gone.  (And at that time, I also noted Venus in the sky, looking much further-away and much like a planet, like it always does.)  I am not so informed as to discount the possibility of extra-terrestrial visitors, but it seems much more likely to me that such an object could be military / government in origin.

594,"Trangle UFO hovers over houseThe following report has been submitted by GreyStar Paranormal Institute on behalf of their client.  The details of the following report have been formally submitted to GreyStar Paranormal Institute by the clients and an on camera interview and screening was conducted.On the morning of February 19th, 2017, at 4:12am (witness #1) was on their front porch which faces the Manchester, New Hampshire, Airport located 2.5 miles in a straight line of sight from their front yard.Witness #1 noticed lights that at first were thought to be just an ordinary airplane in the distance.  (Witness #1) has lived at their current residence for several years and is very familiar with the air traffic and common flight paths used by the airport in the area. The lights soon deviated from a seemingly typical course and started an approach to (witness #1’s) location.  The distant lights of the object became increasingly bright (at least twice as bright as a normal aircraft) as described by (witness #1).  At that point the witness left the front porch to wake his wife that was sleeping in their bedroom.Upon waking his wife (witness #1) requested her to come outside to witness this unusual event.Upon exiting their house to return to the front porch they notice that the lights were now just above the tree tops in their front yard making a slow descent, even closer to the tree tops, (witness #2) stated that the object was so close that it was almost touching the tree tops.Both (witness #1) and his wife watched in amazement as the outline of a black Triangular silhouette hovered silently directly above their home coming to what seemed like a brief stop.  They could clearly see the objects shape as it was slightly backlit by the aura of the soon to be breaking light of dawn, there were bright white lights on all 3 corners of the craft.(witness #2) remarked that the object was totally silent not giving off any engine noises typically heard with normal aircraft.  They did however, note that there was a slight whooshing sound present but not sounding like anything associated with any man-made objects.(witness #2) also noted that they could feel a warmth coming from the object.Both witnesses became frightened by this event unfolding just above their house. (witness #2) wrapped her arms around (witness #1) and she said she could feel his heart pounding from the excitement of the event as they stared at the craft in amazement and fear.During this moment, the object went from hovering directly above their house to almost passing completely over their house as if there was a cut in the frame during the event being played out.  The object seemingly hopped from one location to another without gliding as previously witnessed.Both witnesses then reported that after noticing this glitch moment that they both became almost robotic in demeanor as if what they just witnessed was no longer important.  The light of dawn had fully broken as if in one moment it was slightly getting light out to “it is now light out” in the next moment. Both witnesses could still see the object moving slowly over their house but instead of following the object that was heading towards their back yard both witnesses started to walk back into their house.They both entered the home and made coffee, not talking about the event other than a few blurbs about how odd the whole thing was.  They also reported that the whole event occurred in a matter of minutes but upon looking at the clock when entering the house they noted that it was now 4:45am and over 30 minutes had passed.It wasn’t until later that evening both witnesses realized that what they experienced was highly unusual and they decided to report the incident a couple days later to the ufo-hunters website and then a couple days later they reported the incident to GreyStar Paranormal Institute.This report is the result of the interview conducted by GreyStar.  Photos of the location were taken. No physical evidence was gathered however, a physical examination of the witnesses was conducted and a full background history was gathered.  The witnesses report that they have had unusual experiences in the past with strange occurrences and sightings of balls of light and odd animal behavior over the course of several years.There have been unusual electronic disturbances in the home in regards to the function of cable boxes, cell phones, computers and other electronic devices. (witness #2) reported to GreyStar staff that a family member on (witness #1’s) side of the family has allegedly acknowledged the possibility that they have had encounters with ufos & extraterrestrials, this statement has yet to be confirmed however, follow up interviews will ensue to confirm this statement. If the statement is true and is confirmed, then that would mean that there could be a family history relating back to UFO sightings and alien encounters as common with lineage based UFO encounters.The witnesses answered nearly 200 predesignated questions flawlessly and scored above average in authenticity.  The witnesses showed genuine concern when recounting the events they had witnessed and they were outwardly disturbed by what they had experienced.  It is in the opinion of the examiner that hypnotic regression be pursued.When this idea was presented to the witnesses only one of them agreed.  It is believed that the other witness is fearful of what they might remember and they have not been pressed further however, they have been given an open invitation to pursue hypnotic regression in the future.GreyStar estimates from details given from in the description by the witnesses that the triangular UFO was approximately 60ft wide by 90ft long calculated by using google earth as a measuring tool.This concludes our report to the National UFO reporting center.  This report has been submitted as a means to cross reference future data for other local UFO sightings and to attempt to see if anyone else in the area witnessed anything unusual or similar on that morning.The results of the of the yet to be conducted hypnotic regression may become available on the GreyStar Paranormal Institute website in the future if a release of such information is agreed upon by the clients and can be submitted to NUFORC for their records upon request if released by the clients.",Duration:30 minutes,"Location: Londonderry, NH",Occurred : 2/19/2017 04:12  (Entered as : 03/19/17 4:12),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 3/6/2017 5:52:59 AM 05:52,Shape: Triangle

I was sitting on one of the chairs facing East looking out the living room window that also faces East, and while my nephew was commenting on a topic we were discussing, I saw what I can only describe as this:  “Two oval-shaped lights, BRIGHT, sparkling,” appeared over the treetop of a neighbor’s home.The only lighting from outdoors came from two homes, which I could see from my position.  These two porch lights and one dull, street light were the only noticeable light sources.I stared in puzzlement with what I was seeing, and the flurry of possibilities came flooding into my mind of what I was seeing:  “Maybe it’s the traffic lights from the neighborhoods in the hills…but that can’t be because there’s no lights or traffic lights coming from that direction. It’s a big rig…wait, that’s too close and too big to be that low and that big.  Street lights?  No.  That’s not a street light.”  These are the thoughts that were racing in my mind as I watched these “lights” float and lower to the level of the neighbor’s rooftop and then disappear.I stared, after it disappeared, trying to figure out what I had just seen.  The first words out of my mouth after the “lights” disappeared, was, “Oh. My. Gosh.”  Not wanting to create fear with my nephew, I waited until he was finished with his conversation and slowly introduced him into what I had just witnessed.  His response was doing the “Sign of the Cross,” and uttering a quick prayer.  I laughed reassuring  him that there was no need to be concerned because I wasn’t afraid.  I said to my nephew, “I KNOW what I saw.  I saw it. I just don’t know WHAT I saw. What the HELL did I just see?”  This incident lasted about 2-3 seconds, but DAMN, I can’t get it out of my head and I am not about to go broadcasting it publicly because who’s going to believe a random sighting of unexplainable lights amidst skeptics? Well, there you have it.  I would NEVER put myself into a position of being persecuted for perjury.  I KNOW what I saw, I can’t explain WHAT it was, but I KNOW what I saw.

625,"12 red/orange large, identical, oval objects, flying exact same speed, slowly over Longmont, CO.I saw a dozen oval/elongated rectangular large (car sized?) objects flying slowly across sky heading NE.

They all traveled at the same speed and though not in a straight line held the exact line pattern the entire time they traveled through the sky.  They appeared to be flying about the same height as small airplanes do in our area – 1,500 feet?  They did not waver in speed or direction.  Lights did not flicker – only saw steady red/orange lights on each.See youtube video “six orange UFO fireball phenomenon 2013” – this is almost identical to what I saw except objects were more oval/elongated rectangular than round.

I guess that was why I was looking up there.  Venus was visible already [it was pre-dusk] high in the south-west - and that light in the northern sky had about the same magnitude than Venus did that evening.  As we drove home -about a 10 minute drive] we still saw that light, but it soon faded dramatically, only to split into two fainter lights, hovering above each other, then starting to 'dance' around each other [my daughter said 'they are playing tag']. When I ran inside to get the binoculars, the lights were gone ... as there never was anything up there. Last evening [Februray 21] we saw the same thing again. Same time, same location, same brightness at first. This time I had binoculars at hand, and two neighbours witnessed it too [though, they dismissed it as balloons or something like that]. After waiting about 20 minutes, the light faded again and it split into many tinier lights. The binoculars revealed that the original light was donut shaped, and after fading, the smaller were just light dots, moving erratically, before shooting away in all directions with such speed I could not follow them with the binoculars. I also saw two, what looked like cloud-shapes among the seven tinier lights before they shot away. I'd like to know what we all saw ...

It's 72 clear bluebird skies in SC in Feb so we were enjoying the weather.  As I am looking up at the sky I see a jet liner coming out of the south heading north east.  Just then an object the same color as the jet liner enters my view from strait over my head moving from SW to NE. It is egg shaped and the size of Venus in the night sky.  The object was moving at what appeared to be a high rate speed.  It went from over head to out of sight (about 70 deg.) in 4-5 sec.

I actually called the UFO hotline within 30 seconds of this happening (google search on my cell phone) and the guy was very short with me and requested I submit a report here.  After I hung up I was looking up toward where the object had went and I saw what appeared to be the same object appear from the NE and back to the SW.  The object was moving slower this time and it actually stopped briefly and then quickly went off to the East and then suddenly vanished.  Then about 1 minute later another object the same shape and size following what appeared the same path as the first approaching from the SW moving to the NE, but moving at what appeared to be a slower speed (70 deg.) in 7-8 sec.

I continued to walk across the parking and for a short period the object was eclipsed by the building, so I walked around to the side to get a better look.The object was still there.  For half a second, I though maybe it was a bird soaring in the wind as there was a pretty good breeze blowing, but it appeared to be hovering in place, although it was twisting and turning - plus, it had a definite oval shape.A few seconds later, it stopped turning and exited away to the north/northwest until in was no longer visible.I can't say with certainty that there isn't a prosaic explanation for what the object was, but it was strange.

I followed it with my eyes as it joined (I couldn't believe this) what looked like 3 more faint amber lights..they like danced around each other.

Previously spotted same craft 2 weeks prior w/fireballTonight I sighted a number of bright white lights crossing the sky moving north to south, seen on the western horizons.  These bright lights were spaced evenly at a considerable amount of distance from the next.  All seven lights moved in perfect unison and were traveling in a perfectly straight line.  This, as well as, a quiet but definite low hum that indicated an overpassing aircraft could be heard as it passed.  This hum from the craft was an echoing sound and gave the impression that this craft was very big.  Possibly 1/4 to 1/2 mile long suspecting these numerous lights made one large combined craft.  This was not the first time I have spotted this craft.

I looked over at a small softball park that behind our property, it is closed for the winter.  I saw close to the ground a red glowing orb.  I thought at first it was someone with a dim flashlight, but then it appeared to flicker out like a flame.  Then reappeared, and then disappeared again.  I can't pinpoint exactly where it was, since I was looking across several acres, and trees.  No one else saw this.Wednesday February 14, 2017, we were again walking out to retrieve our horses.  this was around 7:30 PM.  My husband said something and stopped.. I stopped and backed up to see, a cluster of these glowing red almost rectangular in shape lights, that were up in the air, through the trees.  There were at least 7 lights, that randomly came on and off, and would reappear in other locations. These lights appeared to be dripping something.  It appeared as if there were burning embers dropping from these lights.Also amongst these, were white sparkly lights, that would come on and go off randomly.  We had a helper who ran out of the barn, to see what we were seeing, and he too witnessed the lights.  I then thought to take out my phone and record, and I did get a small white dot, that came on and off, but it is hard to see much from it.    A 4th person came out of the barn and also witnessed some of the lights.  By this time they were drifting north and getting further way, and all we saw at this point was the white sparkly ones.  We watched until they disappeared.Thursday February 15th, 2017,  this night we did not have to bring the horses in, as they stayed in most the day, but we did decide to go out and see if we could see the lights again. This was at 7:00 PM.  We saw them immediately in the same area.  Same red glowing lights, that soon went out. We ran toward the back of our property to get beyond the trees, and were treated to many white sparkly lights, and clusters of pulsating white lights, that we thought at first were airplanes.  However, I mentioned that there were too many, too close together to be airplanes, and they were not traveling, they were staying stationary.  Then we saw for just an instant, a row of red round lights, that lit up one at a time, till a row was visible, and then they went out just as they lit up.  3 of us witnessed this.  By this time the white strobes slowly drifted north again, leaving one loan red orb, hovering over the trees.  This was very far off, but we could see it.  It would move left the! n right, go up a ways.. over, and then back down. This stayed for at least 10 minutes.

650,"It was a white, illuminating object that hovered in the sky for a second and then proceeded to ascend at a rapid rate of speed.It was my mother and I and we were pulling into our neighborhood late at night after a trip to Charleston.  As we approached the house, I saw a small white light in the air that looked like a star.  A second after I noticed it, it ascended at a rapid elevation into the sky, until disappearing.  To note, the object rate of acceleration was too high to have been a helicopter, so I immediately discarded that idea.  I did however, suspect it to be an LED helicopter, which are small, colorfully illuminated toys that are flung up into the air at a high speed.  If not a manned craft of some nature, this would appear to be the most likely explanation.  However, this white object lacked any of the flashing colors of the LED toy (which would consist of blue, red, green, etc), and did not fall back to the ground at any noticeable time.  It merely hung in the sky for a single second, and then took off into the sky.  I myself am very open minded to the possible existence of extraterrestrial UFOs; however, I also firmly believe that the majority of such sightings are either hoaxes or misinterpretations.  This understanding is what prevented me from making a post earlier when it happened.  However, after learning through research that there has been a number of small UFO sightings in the unexpected area of upstate South Carolina, I thought that perhaps mentioning my quick encounter could be worth while.  Do note that I am not making a firm conclusion that it was of extraterrestrial origins, but rather that I cannot come to any definite conclusion to what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time indicated above, to reflect a nighttime sighting.

722,"Today at 15:15, my wife and I went to visit her mother and arrived there at 15:35.  At 15:45 my son called us and said he could see a UFO back at my house 4.9 miles away, north of our location.I immediately went outside to look and asked him where to look in the sky, and he said north.  I couldn't see anything but looked for some point of reference and noticed an airliner taking off from LAX (it was climbing) some 10.7 miles away north west from our location at mother's in Torrance Ca.I asked him if he could see the jet and he said no but would go to the front yard to get an unobstructed view.  While he was moving from the back yard to the front I could see a flash that lasted about one second.The flash was about 60% the size of a full moon.  This object flashed three times and at three second intervals, and on the third flash I could see what appeared to be a star but in full daylight as it was a very bright white light.I then noticed a pinkish orange flash coming from the star object at three second intervals. My son came back on the phone and said it was on a collision course with the airliner which he could now see.The star object would flash for a second coast for three seconds and then flash again for a second.  At this point my eyes were adjusted and I could see a second identical object trailing the first.  It was also flashing pinkish orange but at two second intervals until it caught up with the first object.The scene left me with the impression it was dropping down from a higher altitude to a lower one.  The second star craft was as it was dropping down reminded me of a shooting flare much like a descending flare from a flare gun except it was bright white.When the two objects were even they both were flashing in complete unison as if they were mirror images of each other.  They were perfectly side by side and were headed from the northwest towards the southeast.  They gave me the impression like, they were skipping across the sky.  Like an ice skater, rhythmic and smooth.I told my son I could see two objects and they were headed towards me.  I looked at my watch and it was 15:50 and told my son to go to work because the incident distracted him from going to work.  He was suppose to be at work at 16:00 and he hung up the phone and went to work.The airliner was headed perfectly due east and I could see the airliner and star objects converge.  I almost expected a collision but the star objects were well above the airliner because one of the star objects was blotted out by the mass of the jet but for only a split second.Just when I thought it couldn't get any better a third object appeared as if it just dropped in on the other two objects.  The third object dropped in on the other two exactly like the second star object.I expected the third Starcraft to line up with the other two but it did not, it went into what I think was a kind of missing man formation.  It hung slightly back of the other two and at a distance double the distance of the first two objects.Had there been a fourth object lined up with the other three they would have been perfectly spaced.  Like this.  *   *   *   *  except the far right third object was slightly behind like this.          •  •         *  Size and Distance if a circle is 360 degrees and from horizon is 180 degrees then the the two objects were about 5 degrees apart and the third object at 10 degree and slightly back.My son sighted the first object at 15:40 I caught site of the first one at roughly 15:48 by 15:50 my son left for work he said he seen two and missed the third possibly because by 15:48 they were closer to me than him.The third object went back up and disappeared while the two continued southeast until I lost sight of them at about 15:55 due to the distance. They were almost directly over head and my neck is sore form looking up so long.They seemed too slow as by my estimation if you could have seen them from horizon to horizon it would have taken them 30 minutes to make that distance. Between my son and I we watched them for 15 minutes.Thank you for your work.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Torrance, CA",Occurred : 2/12/2017 15:45  (Entered as : 02/12/17 15:45),Posted: 2/17/2017,Reported: 2/13/2017 4:49:25 AM 04:49,Shape: Light

Today it is crystal clear with no clouds.  We often see airplanes fly overhead but this these were obviously not planes.I watched them for about a minute before pulling out my Galaxy Note 5 set to 1920x1080 30p with Image stabilization on.When I first noticed them I thought they were balloons but quickly realized they were not because of their size and speed. They moved like fighter jets changing formation darting around then getting back into various formations. because of how high they are and large about the size of airplanes I knew they were not normal, I knew I needed to record them.At the beginning of the video, they look very far away and tiny. It's unfortunate that smartphone cameras make things that are about the distance of an airplane look much tinier than they are because to the human eye these UFO's were much closer like looking up at an airplane flying over at about 2,000-3,000 feet.It was also clear these things were metallic as they were very reflective and would get easier to see as they maneuvered and changed direction in the sky.I zoomed in but because of how bright the sun was it was hard to see my screen which is why I loose them in conjunction with how fast they were moving across the sky.Lastly, I know it may lose some credibility because I put my product logos on the video but I have a family to support so I had to capitalize on this unique and puzzling experience with my kids.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be extremely credible.

724,"White lit cigar shaped object moving very quickly and effortlessly for a minute before disappearing to the East in the blink of an eye.At 8:30 this morning at my house, something caught my eye in the sky to the East.  It is difficult to estimate the height and location of the object, but I estimate it was centered over Winter Springs, Florida at a height that was a little higher than you would typically see a helicopter.  The object was likely Frisbee shaped, but I believe I was just seeing it from the side which I would describe as Cigar shaped.  My first thought was that it was a drone, but it was moving too quickly and effortlessly.  It went from the original location to the left and hovered, then to the right and hovered, and then up higher to hover.  The changes in location were split second, not gradual changes.  The object seemed to be lit up with a white light that covered its entire shape.  Based on how white the light was and that it didn’t seem like a glare, my guess is that it was a light coming from the object and not the sun’s reflection.  I was able to track the minor movemen! ts for about a minute before the object proceeded East at a speed that disappeared from view within a moment.  It is a sunny day here with some clouds in the sky, but no weather conditions can explain what I saw.

726,"Bright, multi coloured, shape changing object, very large, low in the sky, hovering then moving off quickly.This was completely by accident.  I was getting up to get some honey for my sore throat.  I noticed that the moon was very bright, however very few stars actually visible in the night sky.  We are accustomed to seeing planes come in from the direction I was looking.  What caught my eye was that it did not appear to be moving and rather than the traditional, well timed flash of lights on the wing of a plane, these were multi coloured and extremely bright lights. And rather than the lights appearing to be on the object, the lights seemed to be the object and around the object all at the same time.  The other anomaly was that it was not moving.  I lined it up with a street light on the other side of the city and stood stationary and it never moved.  The tree line was also visible in the dark and it was not going up or down either.  We keep binoculars in the kitchen window for bird watching so I steadied my arms by resting them on the counter and looked through.  Plane shapes are easily seen this way.  This was not holding a specific shape and seemed to change randomly in a fluid manner.I woke up my house mate and the first suggestion was that it may be Sirius which most certainly can have bright flashing colours.  Although we have never seen Sirius that low in the sky. The other thing that was strange was that it looked considerably bigger than a star in the sky.  Taking into consideration there were only two other stars visible in the clear view of the sky from the kitchen window, it was strange enough to keep watching.After approximately another five minutes of watching it, the object slowly moved away in the direction of South West fairly fast until it appeared to be lowering in the sky to the tree line.  It was definitely moving away rather than dropping because it was getting smaller and harder to see.Taking the distance from the object, night time hours, treeline and buildings into consideration, I would estimate the overall size (although fluidly changing) to be that of five to six city buses, end to end, wide.  And perhaps four city buses, end to end, high.We both had the sensation of feeling unnerved.  I can only describe it as feeling like we were seeing something that was not right.  Even when we trying to rationalize that it was a star or something else.  It was a little upsetting and exciting at the same time.  Just a knowing that something was, off?

738,"Bright Lights Appearing Over Bozeman Pass, Montana.Bozeman, MT - Our sighting location was near Exit 316 off I-90 at Trail Creek at about 18:35 on 2/11/2017.  We had been outside for about 10-15 minutes looking at constellations and planets in the night sky while waiting for the International Space Station (ISS) to pass overhead at the scheduled 18:47.  The sky was black and very clear.  No clouds. The stars, satellites, and planets were easily visible.Suddenly, in the northeast sky, two large, very bright, white lights just appeared above tree top level.   The light on the right was much brighter than the left.  The brighter light was brighter and larger than Venus was in the sky that night.  The lights were of the same intensity and moved in tandem, remaining the same distance from each other and at a 45 degree angle to each other at all times.  They seemed like they were connected together.The lights remained stationary as they slowly adjusted their angle until the light on the right became higher in the sky than the left light.  The lights paused a moment, then began to steadily move to the northeast until they disappeared into the night sky. There was no sound, no color to the lights, and no flashing.  They moved slower than the ISS does when it passes overhead, and they were obviously very much lower to the Earth than the ISS.

745,"Missing time during return trip home from picking up pizza.Hello,  I wanted to share something that happened to me on February 10th, 2017, at around 7:15PM EST.  On Friday around 6:30PM I left my house to go pickup a pizza we had ordered for dinner.  I made the trip there with nothing abnormal, began the trip home and seem to have lost some time.  After making a left turn onto NC RT49 in Roxboro, NC, heading back to my home about 9 miles away, I remember seeing a section of the road where after the left turn, the road has 4 lanes.  About a mile or two after that the road narrows to 2 lanes and its around another 8 miles to my house.  I moved here about 3 years ago, so I am usually looking around at landmarks, way points, or familiar sights to keep me aware of where I am.  During this trip home I remember the part where the road changes to two lanes, but have no memory of what I saw during the trip home until I looked up, saw lights in the sky above me, and realized I had driven passed the road my house in on, and driven another 8 miles or so.  I onl! y remember seeing the lights above the road, and had to sort of hunch down in the seat to see them above the road.  At that point, I realized where I was, looked at the clock and it was 7:28PM.  I thought maybe I had fallen asleep, but the road has some curves-twists that could not be navigated without some sort of intelligent control.

747,"Shape shifting balls possible UFOOk. So I'm not 100% sure what I saw.  I am a pretty scientificly literate person.  I am going to explain what I saw in the best detail I can.  Mid-February sometime, I'm driving along the 101 highway near the Vermont exit in LA.  It's raining sort of heavy and all of the cars are going about 10-25mph.  I see an object floating in the distance.  It gets my attention because it's not moving at all, it's completely frozen/locked in position.  Mind you it was pretty windy and raining (rare in LA).  I squint to see what it is but can't make out any details.  At first I thought it was a balloon but a balloon would've been moving with the weather.  As I drove closer I pass under a bridge and it comes in to view about 50 feet over the next bridge.  As I drive closer I see this object.  The best way to describe it would be 3-5 balls in a vertical row connected to a central line that was not visible (imagine 2 balls on the left of the line,3 on the right).  The balls were literall! y merging and crisscrossing into each other repeatedly.  They were all metallic looking and I remember seeing red, a darkish blue and dark silver colors.  The rate at which these balls were merging was completely against the environment and unlike anything I've ever seen. The merging was slow and rhythmic. Kind of like a 1,2,3,4  of a waltz but half time.  I looked to see a line, maybe something it was connected to and saw nothing.  As I got closer those details got clearer to the point where I could actually see the balls enter into each other and coming out on the other side. I passed under the bridge it was floating over and never seen it again.Being a very sane person and someone who deeply values science and the scientific method I have been troubled by not being able to express exactly what it is I saw.

I have definitely seen similar things in the sky before, but this one stood out to me.  It seemed to be moving a lot more than the objects of a similar nature that I had seen before.  It would move left, right, up, and down.  Also, it seems to change shape, but I am unsure whether or not it has a definitive shape or if it could be inter-dimensional.  It seems to shift from a ball of light to a triangular and/ or star-like shape and back.  It is most certainly moving back and forth so I know it is not a satellite or a plane as those move continuously in one direction.  We used a scope to magnify it and another object my father saw moving near the moon.  The initial object was very bright and noticeable and was very clearly moving in multiple directions, but it never shot off or disappeared.

Flagler Beach.I was on South Flagler Avenue by the Flagler beach police station in my vehicle, it was night time and it was approx. 18:40 hours.  An extremely large black triangular object approached from the South West at approx 5-10mph and was approx 1.5 miles away from my location.  I slowed the vehicle to idle to witness the object.  The object appeared approx 2,500- 4,000 feet in the atmosphere at that time.  At first sight, it appeared that the object was not on a horizontal plane.  It appeared to be on more of a vertical plane.  Upon first sight of this object i noticed 3 lights; they appeared similar to butterscotch in color.  The object remained moving towards my location at 5-10mph.  I noticed a vehicle in front of me heading north on Flagler avenue that had stopped to take pictures of the object.  I brought my vehicle to a complete stop and got out of the vehicle and I continued taking photos with my Galaxy Note smart phone. The vehicle behind me heading south, pulled! over on to the right hand side of the road.  The driver got out of the vehicle and appeared to be using a video camera (not a smart phone) and was capturing the object on video.

At that time, the object appeared to be approx. 500 feet in width and length and on a horizontal plane.  Upon looking up I saw 3 lights that were visible, the lights were on each of the 3 points.  The lights were recessed and cylindrical and did not have an aura.  The light on the north east side, front forward moving, and the North West side, front forward moving were bright white.  The light on the back side of the object or the Southside was blue.  Directly underneath the object, in between the North West side white light and the South side blue light were approx. 15-20 spherical shape impressions on the underside of the object.  The object was dark and the only reason I could tell it was tri! angular was because of the 3 lights, the 15-20 spherical shape! impress ions running in between the two lights.  The object made no sound, no vibration and no other auditory sensory. The object appeared to keep moving at the same 5-10 mph and towards the north east. It did not change speed, vanish, dematerialize or change in any immediate direction; velocity remained the same with no immediate changes.

There were no other unusual sounds sights or behaviors witnessed in the city.Night is also considered significant in unknown way as I had a very, very, very! detailed dream some years ago of the wedding chapel interior, including seeing in detail several items, despite never seeing them before.The wedding was of the child of a friend of a family member, so it held no personal significance and was not noteworthy outside of the green beans, which were good.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It seems to be some type of orange fire ball that sometimes is only 1 ball and then others up to 6.  The object would only light up for a min then fade away without any noise at all.  At first I thought it could have been a flare until it reappeared with  2 , 4 or 6 of the same shape and color objects and the objects have showed up like clock work every afternoon just as the sun is going down and always in the same general area but were obviously not planes or anything I've  ever seen and where I live is near two airports one is only a few miles away so I know what an aircraft looks like and where they were wasn't in the direction as the airport.

855,"I observed a white, illuminating dot hovering in the night sky and then elevating towards the sky and disappearing.It was my mother and I and we were pulling into our neighborhood late at night, after a trip to Charleston.  As we approached the house, I saw a small white light in the air that looked like a star.  A second after noticing it, it ascended at a rapid elevation into the sky until disappearing.  To note, the object rate of acceleration was too high to have been a helicopter, so I Immediately discarded that idea.  I did however, suspect it to be an LED helicopter, which are small, colorfully illuminated toys that are flung up into the air at a high speed.  If not a manned craft of some nature, this would appear to be the most likely explanation. However, this white object lacked any of the flashing colors of the LED toy (which would consist of blue, red, green, etc), and did not fall back to the ground at any noticeable time.  It merely hung in the sky for a single second, and then took off into the sky.  I myself am very open minded to the possible existence of extraterrestrial UFOs; however, I also firmly believe that the majority of such sightings are either hoaxes or misinterpretations.  This understanding is what prevented me from making a post earlier when it happened. However, after learning through research that there has been a number of small UFO sightings in the unexpected area of upstate South Carolina, I thought that perhaps mentioning my quick encounter could be worth while.

863,"Four orange yellow lights side by side in a slight 15 degree angle slanting to the right.Sighting 6:40 pm 1/31/17 Mechanicsburg, PA  I was driving east on US RT 11 locally called the Carlisle Pike at about 6:40 pm I noticed unusual lights in the sky to the right South of my location about 50 degrees off the horizon.  The lights where four orange yellow lights in a downward sloping angle about 15 degrees.  The lights appeared to be round.  It was well above the tree line but too low for a commercial aircraft unless it was landing in Harrisburg, the location seemed off in regards to a plane landing and the lights were solid not flashing as planes normally do.  The lights appeared to be stationary and not moving as a plane would. It's important to note that the Moon was behind me and that while Venus is currently just to the right of the moon and Mars just above the Moon forming a triangle this was not in the area of the sky where this sighting took place.Mechanicsburg is in the middle of the Cumberland Valley part of the Great Appalachian Valley just west of Harrisburg PA.  Two major highways pass by Mechanicsburg to the South the Pennsylvania Turnpike and just to the North interstate 81.  I reference this because the Turnpike is used as guide into Philadelphia International by planes coming from the West, it's also the flight path of the local medivac helicopter from its base in Carlisle, PA.  There is a large amount of air traffic that flies high over my neighborhood daily.As I drove I tried keeping my eyes on the object and the road as traffic was flowing  steadily for post rush hour so I didn't have an opportunity to pull over.  I made sure to note the time and reached for my cell phone to try and get a picture.  When I opened my camera app on my iPhone the camera app malfunctioned giving me a screen of green bars horizontally and up and down.  During the process of closing the app restarting the app and driving the lights disappeared.Mechanicsburg is home to the Naval Support Activity Mechanicsburg, a 806 acre facility with over 150 buildings, including a Department of Defense rail yard including Nuclear Cask railroad cars. The area of the light anomaly was over the area occupied by this installation.I'm a special education teacher by degree and career.

888,"Two erratic bright white lights seen in Southern California daytime skyMy wife and I were having breakfast at a bagel shop at 12914 Ventura Blvd this morning. We were seated outside, and near the end of our meal, I glanced around the sky.  It was such a beautiful and clear Southern California day, especially after the recent storms in the area.  While looking around, I noticed a twinkling white light to the north, about the same height in the sky as the top of a street light pole on Ventura Blvd from where we were seated. I first thought that it was a very bright and early star, but the twinkling was too bright to the naked eye, and I immediately observed very slow movement.  My next thought was a potential satellite sighting, but no straight flight path existed — movement was somewhat erratic, though slow at times.  This was easily confirmed due to the light’s position just to the right of the street light pole, which allowed me a point of reference in the sky.The light was far too high, to my observation, to be commercial aircraft (best guess was 150,000ft or more) — it was too erratic and slow for a satellite path, and it also didn’t appear to be any type of rocket (to my knowledge) due to it’s start-stop movement.  The emitting of light (or glinting of sunlight off of the object, which was another thought) also had no pattern and seemed to be random, almost as if the object was spinning about — at times it became so dim to the point that I’d thought it disappeared, then it would randomly shine bright seconds later, as bright as a star in the early evening or early morning sky.  The level of brightness was observed changing drastically without obstruction as the light slowly pinged about the clear blue sky.A second white light holding the same characteristics was also observed momentarily, further up in the sky and to the left of the first light I fixated upon.  To confirm, my wife and I both observed these objects and all of the mentioned movements/lights.  The only further detail I observed on the main light was the emission of tiny, nearly invisible, red lights — these seemed to be ejected from the object and quickly disappeared into the blue of the sky.  This detail was very hard for me to see, but I know that I did observe this.I captured iPhone video of this sighting, and upon review later in the day, both white lights (along with their visual characteristics and movements) can be clearly seen in the footage.  This entire event lasted over 3 minutes.

They slowly traveled South rising upward along the coast and disappeared into the low cloud cover just about due East of our house.  They flew quite close together and were too bright to be drones.  They didn't have flashing lights like standard aircraft, but more of a steady orange glow.  They may have been far enough away to be over the ocean, but that still doesn't explain what manner of craft they were.Planes don't take off and group like that and I don't know of an airport North of the Boca Raton one nearer than the somewhat distant Palm Beach International.

The light was  bright enough to be clearly seen, even in the adverse weather.  I opened the window to listen for sounds such as a helicopter or airplane but none were present.  It felt as though the light was watching me and I was watching it. I shut my blinds and continued to watch the light through them.  Suddenly 2 more beach ball sized lights appeared.

909,"Very bright green singular orb pulsing illogically, making 90-degree turns and moving impossibly.January 28th, 2017, at roughly 12:10 a.m., my boyfriend called me outside to see something, telling me to hurry.  As a smoker, he is outside rather frequently.  I dropped the late night dishes I was working on and hurried to the back door assuming he had spotted an owl.  He pointed at the sky and said, “WHAT is THAT?”  Frankly, I started to say helicopter but I got this out, “heli…” as I took in the sight and realized how large, how bright, how pulsing, and how it was NOT moving like a helicopter.  Furthermore, helicopters don’t use shockingly green, pulsing lights. The very bright, and I mean bright, neon-electric green blob shot in 90-degree angles multiple times where I heard myself blurt, “What IS that?”  Just like my boyfriend had done.  It gave me the impression it was darting from place to place like it had not prepared a logical route and had to backtrack frequently.  I’m sure that’s not true but that is exactly what went through my logical, planning mind.  I would plot a course and have a plan of action, not dart and backtrack all over town if I was trying to accomplish something.It flashed, I really should say pulsed, this green light but it wasn’t logical pulsing like an aircraft does.  I live near a very small, businessman’s style airport, RL Jones in Jenks, OK and having lived here about 15 years, I know what the airplanes coming and going look like and what they do night and day.  Additionally, my former step-father of 10 years was a pilot for American Airlines and I’ve been in his open-cockpit airplane, a private jet he flew and have detailed experience being in and around aircraft.  This was NOT an airplane.This thing was brighter than anything in the sky.  If I had to compare its brightness to something I would go with something in Las Vegas.  One of their casinos.  That bright.  Bright enough that when my boyfriend pointed it out, I didn’t have scan the horizon and search or squint.  My eyes snapped right to this green flashing light.It made no sound I could hear.  The pulsing lights it had would flash very quickly but not in any discernable pattern, and then turn off for a split second.  When the lights would return, all but once it would have moved a decent distance.  At one point it shot so far away, it became a pinpoint of green light, but then it immediately shot back to where it had been.Like I said, this pulsing, vibrant light had no logical sequence of illumination I could detect and I got the visual feeling that the lights were rolling upward, sideways and down to create the undulating, pulsing type light I was witnessing.Right as my boyfriend returned with his phone to try and record this thing, the light went out for about 1 second.  It illuminated again still in the same spot, and then the object moved a great linear distance over the rooftops in my field of vision.  It was gone in a second.  1 single second after traversing what is visually to me at least two miles.  Probably more like three as we sit on a bit of rolling hill and can see very far from our vantage point.  It disappeared after it made that long, inexplicable stretch.The trajectory it took generally takes the airplanes I see a couple of minutes to cross.  I watch airplanes take the similar route daily and I can watch them for minutes.  This was a singular second.  I have to assume this object was large to be where it was and so visible, because typically those aircraft are 747’s when they are at that altitude, or much lower and loud if leaving RL Jones and obvious.  I can see airplanes from both airports from where my house sits.  This thing was markedly brighter, like incomparably bright.You might be tempted to assume it was a Friday night and we were drinking.  First, I’m 48-years-old and so is my boyfriend.  Secondly, he just got out of the hospital with diverticulitis.  One of his antibiotics he must take is alternatively used to help people quit drinking and will cause vicious migraine headaches if the patient attempts to drink.  The pharmacist heavily warned him not to dare drink anything alcoholic while taking this antibiotic, so not only was he not drinking, I wasn’t.  We don’t take drugs, either.  Neither of us has mental disorders of any sort, nor would be so insane as to take time out of our day to write a fake report.I actually was very unnerved.  I said prayers, to be frank, for a good while before I went to bed about 30 minutes later.  I didn’t get a happy E.T. feeling.  I got a hair-raising, yuck, I-don’t-like-that-thing feeling.  I’m not a fearful person.  Yet, my arm hair stood on end several minutes after coming back inside the house.It was a clear night.  No clouds, no weather, if that matters.Anyway, thank you for letting me report this.  I actually came to this site to check your information hoping someone else saw this.  With the hills we live atop I shouldn’t have been one of two people to see it.  It was over the Arkansas River a good while, so I assume people on Riverside Drive on the east side of the river, (I’m on the west side of this river) which is still Jenks, could see it.  As far as it darted it also spent some time (seconds that I saw, no more) over south Tulsa, and when it took its pinprick size, long distant jaunt for that second, I would say it was over Glenpool but it went so far it may have crossed into another small suberb.

921,"star/ white cylinder object seen by students at schoolI am a school teacher.  My class and I were outside doing a couple laps on the school track after lunch.  The sky was clear and a couple planes were going by.  I glanced up and was looking at the long trail produced out the back of one of the planes, when I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the east by southeast portion of the sky.  It appeared to be above the 33,000 foot cruising altitude and was slightly bigger than the planes which were flying their typical daily routes.  It just stayed in one place.  I pointed it out to my kids because we had never seen  a stationary star in the daylight before.  The rest of my class gathered around us and we all stopped and watched it.  It seemed to slowly shift and elongate.  In other words--it went from a star to a white cylinder shape, and then back to a star as if it was maybe rotating like a baton.  It would remain a star and only occasionally switch to the cylinder only a few times (3x).  A couple times it completely disappeared, then would reappear in the same place.  It moved very slowly to the center of the sky at a barely legible speed over the course of 15 minutes, and then completely disappeared.  My class was excited and freaking out to each other.  None of them were scared whatsoever, and in fact seemed very elated.  There was no noise detected from the object, although we cannot hear jets at that altitude either..((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video, and the white light looks to us to be Venus.

924,"Red light hovering and flashing.This morning, around 1:30AM, I was laying my bed and playing on my phone.  Every night I hear an airplane like turbulence noise.  Usually I think nothing of it, but this morning the noise sounded so close that it caused my bed and walls to move and my ears feel like they would pop.  The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.  Then moves back North and stays.  It starts to flash a light towards the ground. It does that twice, almost like in a circle.  Then the third time it flashes at my window.  I freak out and decide to go back to bed (my cat in my bed also was scared. She started to meow weirdly, like she does when begging for water, but she didn’t move to drink). I’m not sure when the light stopped shining because I fell asleep.  I didn't want to tell anyone, because I thought maybe it was a helicopter possibly looking for someo! ne.  Then in the morning my four year old sister, getting ready for school, tells my mom that someone was knocking on the window last night and she was scared to leave her bed to wake my mom.  My mom thinks nothing of it.  I show my mom the video and she tells me what my little sister told her.  At first I thought maybe it was me she heard because I was by the window to film.  When my sister leaves school, I ask her a few questions (I Obviously didnt tell her that it may be aliens because she would never sleep again).  We ask if it was a bang or a knock.  She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.  My mom then asked if she saw anything, and she said she saw a person with no hair.  I asked if it was fat and she said no, that he was very skinny.

It was dark but the porch light was on. I looked up at the sky to see the stars and when I looked to my left (East) I saw a ""V"" shaped light pattern moving in a due West direction, directly over head.  It looked to be very low and very large (I could see it between the roof line of the house and the tree branches which normally, if I see a plane, it's 100 times smaller).  I could hear an engine but it wasn't near as loud as when planes go over head at a lower altitude (Richmond airport is about 15 miles from us).  It proceeded to my right (West) and then went out of sight over the tree tops. There were five white lights...one in the center at the point of the V and two to each side; and there was one green, small light behind the V shape but further back than the tips of the V. I called my husband out and he got there in time to see it flyin! g away and fading out of sight but he did see it. Since we heard an engine, we thought it was a B-52 Stealth or some kind of very large military plane. But, we have seen a Stealth and they make hardly any sound at all so I don't think that was it. And this was so low that I truly expected to hear on the news that a military plane had crashed in the mountains near Charlottesville, VA (which was the direction it was heading). There is an airport in C-ville but I wouldn't imagine a huge military plane landing there since it's a very small airport. I don't know what we saw but we really don't think it was a plane. What made me start looking on the internet to see if anyone else had reported anything was because a day or so later, up until last week, we had tons of military chopper activity going back and forth.

I called out to my husband two or three times quietly, then knocked him in the leg.  He climbed back into the seat.  I pointed at it and said, “Is that what I think it is?”  He was quiet and just looking then said, “Look at these coming in.”   Four circular, hazy, orange, orbs came up to the left of the bright “star.”  The orbs went from a straight line to a chevron form two or three times before noticing there was more orange orbs coming from behind us.  The bright star moved closer but stayed just below the tree line, looked like when the star blinked the orbs changed formation.  When number 8-9 orbs showed up I was too nervous to stay any longer, but never got the feeling of being threatened.  We were able to see them until very close to 287 and just before town there was a very large plane/shuttle that crossed from our right to our left at a fairly slow speed for a “plane.”  The back of it had red and green lights on the back of it.

All of the planets were eliminated as an explanation.After a total of about 90 minutes, I went back to look again and the object had moved well north and slightly west of its previous position.

997,"Green lights in Chevron form flying over Fort Collins, CO.I was letting my roommate's dog outside, when I saw a group of fluorescent green lights in the form of a chevron.  This was observed a few minutes after 23:30 MST approximately 4 blocks south of CSU Fort Collins campus.  The event lasted for 5 to 10 seconds.  It was a clear night with no clouds, stars were visible.  I was the only witness who saw this. I am a senior at Colorado State studying Civil Engineering and have a good understanding of physics, optics, and trigonometry.There were 5 to 7 lights in the formation, and were first seen 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. I was looking south when I first sighted them, and watched them move north almost directly overhead; they were 20 degrees from vertical to the east of me.  As the chevron passed over head, it started accelerating and gaining altitude, before the lights disappeared 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon looking north.  The lights were observed for a total of 100 to 120 degrees in the sky.  As the lights passed from south to north, they changed shape from a chevron into a straight line.  I live on a N-S-E-W street grid, and I can determine that the lights were traveling within 10 degrees of the N-S axis.From the observation point, the lights appeared relatively small, but much larger than a star.  The individual lights were round, with a hazy edge and appeared to be about 1/6 the size of the moon.  The chevron formation had a span of 3 moons, and stayed approximately this size for the entire duration, as they changed shape.  As the object passed overhead, it made no sounds.  The dog I was letting out did not respond to the event.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and sober-minded.

We were marveling at Orion, as he was pretty high in the Eastern sky.

I live with open fields around me in a rural area close to an Air Force base (Shaw AFB).The object was definitely an equilateral triangle with a slow-blinking red light in the middle.  It was low enough that I would be confident in saying the light was at the bottom of a convex/downward dome.  The points of the triangle had white lights that were not blinking.  I would estimate the width of the craft to be on par that of the wingspan of a Boeing 747.  Ahead of the object and to its left was a much smaller craft that was simply a red light as though it were ""towing"" the larger craft--definitely guiding the path for sure.  The light on that smaller craft was not blinking.  I could not make out the shape of this object, but the red light appeared as a dot from my vantage point.I heard zero engine noise.  Since Shaw AFB is home to an F-16 fighter wing, so I know what F-16 engines sound like, even at idle.  This object wasn't making any noises that any aircraft would make, much less an F-16.

I ran inside to get my girlfriend to see, and it was about 20 miles away, maybe hovering over the city of Hurricane. It remained there for about 5 or so mins.  We tried to get a picture and a video, but our cell phone camera was not good enough to pick it up.  At that time it moved upward into the northern sky and disappeared.We called her local police department in St. George, Utah.  They had no other reports a sighting.  They gave us a website that had nothing to do with UFOs. www.nidsci.org and 702.798.1700 for national institute for discovery science.  So we googled that, and found that it is now a closed organization.This was an awesome experience, and it was not like any other 747 or military vehicle that we see flying from Las Vegas to Clearfield, Utah.((NUFORC Note:  NIDS stopped taking UFO reports years ago.

1033,"Circular, reddish UFO's spotted over FTL airport interact with each other & vanish!My friend was getting into his car at around 8:30-9:00pm, when he noticed something flying in the air.  He called me over and pointed toward the object he was watching and my eyes immediately fixated on it.  The object was very high in the sky and I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport so I know most aircrafts do not reach those altitudes when preparing to land or even after taking off.  Most airplanes I am familiar with never reach altitudes past 60,000 feet but the object had to have been up at least 100,000 feet.  The UFO appeared as a seemingly small, circular, reddish dot in the sky, it did not flash or glow.  It was traveling at relatively high speeds but that was the least interesting thing about it.  After we stood watching it for almost a minute, I pulled out my phone in an attempt to get real footage of what we witnessed.  I had an iPhone 6s Plus and the quality of the camera along with the height of the UFO made it impossible to capture due to the time ! of night.  (This has made me into more of a believer than before knowing that even modern day technology is barely capable of capturing something so astonishingly high in the sky.)  It made no audible sounds possibly because of its altitude.  We watched the object continue across the sky until we noticed another exactly similar one!  They were flying towards each other until they got very close to one another.  I knew this was beyond human capability, because one UFO (the second one to be spotted) came to an abrupt stop.  The UFO we originally seen continued on after they had crossed paths for approximately 5-10 seconds.  We watched in amazement and curiosity as the second UFO stopped moving as if it had spotted us!  It shot a white, star-colored dust into the air which dissipated very quickly, which after deep thought, we believe to be a thruster of some sort because the second UFO vanished moments later.  In total, we witnessed about 2 minutes of seemingly unexplainable activity happening thousands of feet above us.  My only dream now is to make contact with those potential life forms as I find humans intolerant or ignorant to the concept of extraterrestrial life inhospitable.  Please do not take this as a joke, there is clear, consistent evidence of extraterritorial contact being covered up by governments around the world.

They were only as bright as evening stars and constant, not blinking or flickering.  I watched them as they move in formation from the right side of the North Star to the left side.

1066,"Spectacular pulsating lights forming a sphere fixed in the night skyI have never filed a report of this nature before, but I can't ignore what I saw so here goes:  I live directly on the coast, so in anticipation of last night's full moon, I settled myself on an outdoor bench that faces due east and overlooks the Atlantic ocean.  The night sky was crystal clear and even with the full moon, the stars were bright as ever.  Roughly 30 minutes into my moon watch, I noticed something ""gliding"" north to south fairly low overhead.  The light configuration was odd in that there two steady white lights spaced slightly apart with a third whitish-green light between them that seemed to pulse slightly somehow, as opposed to a blinking light on a standard aircraft.  In fact, there were no blinking lights anywhere on this object that I could see.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  As I was watching this object move further south, two larger (or lower) orange round objects moving in tandem, each with what looked like yellow and orange light striations coming up from them at an angle, also slid by overhead moving north to south and completely silent.  The first object turned slightly south eastward and began to head slowly out over the ocean.  At this point, I was still trying to believe that this was an aircraft of some sort, but the object stopped suddenly out over the water and became fixed in the sky where it also appeared to progressively become brighter and brighter until I noticed what looked like colors mixing in with the original bright white light.  I just kept staring at this thing, trying to come up with a ""logical"" explanation for what it could be.After 10 minutes or so, I took a chance and ran up to my house to grab my binoculars; I was afraid that the object would disappear if I took my eyes off of it.  But when I got back down to my bench, it was still there and I was able to see it clearly and with great detail through the binoculars.  I still can't find the right words to describe the colors I saw on/in/around the object.  They possessed a brilliance and clarity and purity like I've never seen.  They were not flashing, but rather pulsating and shifting somehow.  Red, green, blue, white, violet...  There were no shafts or beams striking out from the object.  The colors were cohesive and unified, forming a fixed sphere.  The colors shifted and morphed across the object but I never saw them stay still.  Brilliant white light lines appeared interspersed the individual colors somehow, almost like borders but not really because it all pulsed at such a high rate that these white lines were never stationary.  At one point, the ! sphere seemed to elongate into a cylinder and then it returned to a sphere.I called my husband, who was out of town, to describe to him in real time what I was looking at.  I also called my son, who lives a block away and asked him to come over to see what he thought about the odd thing.  We both watched it though binoculars for nearly an hour.  Eventually, the cold air off the water and the night moisture forced us indoors, but I went back out later to see if the object was still there...  It was gone. Neither of us have any idea what it was nor have we ever seen anything like it before.

It had no lights but was very chrome and metallic looking.  The object followed us for about 20 minutes.  My friends and I had all seen it, we are 100% positive it was not anything made by humans.  When we got to the part of road where it was surrounded by woods, we all heard a loud bang noise and could not see the flying saucer type object anymore.  One of my friends said they saw something land to our right.  Us being the naive people we were decided to go check it out. What we saw has forever changed my life.  Do not read past this if you are not prepared for you everything you know to change.My friends and I moved towards where my friend thought he saw the saucer land.  We spent about 20 minutes looking until we found it.  The Saucer was about 10ft by 10ft and was like a Frisbee almost.  It landed in an awkward position, revealing kind of on its side.  We were all freaking out at this point and did not have any idea what we were looking at.  We spent only a short amount of time looking at the crashed saucer because a hatch opened at the bottom revealing a creature that was most definitely NOT HUMAN.  We all saw the creature or alien reveal itself and ran as fast as we possibly could.  We all got in my car and drove away talking about what we just saw.  We came to a consensus that the creature looked like Yoda from star wars just without the pointy ears.

Firstly, I ""discovered"" Coast to Coast AM 2 years ago or so by total accident, as I had no idea it even existed, and I'm very glad that this is an excellent alternative to the worldwide ""status quo self and government-serving"" mainstream media... Anyhow, on January 10th, although still daylight here, around 730 pm Sao Paulo time, 430 pm Miami time, I was in the ocean for my daily dive... The sky was 90% clear but with a very thin patch of cloud directly in front of where I was swimming, around 20 km away and 3,000 meters high or so judging from an island that is located 18 km offshore directly in front of where I normally swim... The town is called Itanhaem, in southeast Sao Paulo State Brazil... While in the water I looked up towards that cloud and I saw a semi-circular distinctly white object moving very slowly northeast from the clear sky part towards the cloud... The object was definitely not a plane or helicopter or weather balloon, or some drone type object, and it obviously it was way too low to be a satellite... When this whitish object reached the inside of that thin cloud it actually stopped moving completely, but it was still clearly visible... I stayed watching it for a few minutes... However, when I looked away for just a few seconds to avoid a bigger wave from hitting my face, I then looked up again at the object and it was gone... I looked around 360 degrees for a couple of minutes to try to spot it again somewhere, but it had vanished completely... No trace, no trail of smoke or any other sign that it took off suddenly, nothing!...I have no idea what that object could have been, and how it could have vanished like a light switch being turned off!... I just thought that this was worth mentioning to your program on sky phenomenon people call in to report... Thank you for your attention...

1101,"Large Disk shape, changing shape and color and smaller objects flying around it.I was at home going upstairs to bed around 9:10 pm. I looked out the window at the top of the stairs and saw a bright white light pulsating. I went to my room to get my binoculars.  I saw a round disk shape that I was thinking looked like a holographic form because of all the tiny white lights and connecting lines of white.  It was hovering over and began changing colors, red, green, white. I yelled for my daughter downstairs. She also viewed the object.  We then went outside in the front yard.  I looked through the binoculars while she was trying to take pictures and record off my phone.  The object was higher than a plane ( one of our videos has a plane flying underneath the obiect) and was higher than a cloud  , but not as high as a star or the moon.  We took turns looking.  I observed it changing shapes from circle to triangle.  It was moving up and down and would also go from side to side.  I would see it spilt and was describing as pie shapes, it would split ! and then pull back together as a solid circle shape.  We watched for about 45 mins and decided to go inside. I continued watching upstairs out the window where I originally saw it.  It continued doing the same actions but the shapes were changing into like a fish shape and what seemed like a cylinder shape.  The only thing I could see was lights connected by a white line, these are the shapes  I am describing.  I continued to watch from there until about 10:20 pm.  The object then zipped further away in the distance toward the south and out of my view.  I have a big window facing South and was able to view the object from there.  It was further away in the distance. I continued to watch the same patterns, but I was able to see a separate white light moving around the bigger circle, this light had even tinier white lights falling down from the sky.  I continued to watch till 12am when it was even further in distance and harder to see with the binoculars.Daughter Cassie’s detailed description:  It was about 9pm on 1/8/2017 I was downstairs watching Tv.  My mom went upstairs for bed.  About 5 min later she’s yelling my name telling me to come upstairs.  She said she saw a ufo outside!  So I took a look in the binoculars and got focused on what she was looking at!  Once I did I saw a holographic diamond shape in the sky!  I looked around at all the other bright lights I saw in the sky of course because I was really wasn't  believing what I was seeing!  Nothing else up there looked like this so We went outside to get a better look!  I watched and watched this thing for a good hr.! it was just hovering over one area until it disappeared and went to a new spot about 2 hrs later. While looking at this threw the binoculars I could see it rapidly changing colors. I’m not sure how else to describe it other than the colors just blended together & you could see all of them at one time. It also kept changing shapes. I’m not sure if it was turning and I was just seeing a different side of it or if it was actually changing the shape of its self. I did see something open up from the bottom and a bright ray of purple light came out of the bottom of it! It did not last long though I would say it was there for what felt about a minute then the purple slowly disappeared. When looking at this threw the binoculars I did get a little freaked out & thought something was watching me so I felt I needed to stop looking. When looking at this with your naked eye it was just a really bright ! light. While recording it on the phone with no flash on it was a bright light that quickly moved from one spot to another without any explanation. I have never seen anything like this before! it was absolutely amazing to see! At one point an airplane flew by and this object was above the plane level but below the stars!

1109,"Strange melodic hum, higher pitched, alternating between 2 tones and moving back and forth N and W of Golden, CO.Woke up at about 3 am to a loud melodic hum during the catastrophic wind storm that hit Colorado this month that sounded like it was above my house.  It was like nothing I’ve ever heard before.  It moved north away from the house and sounded like it was moving back and forth between the northern and western part of Golden.  I woke up my girlfriend and she was able to hear it to, but couldn’t make sense of it either.	Checked around while it was going on and the sound didn’t appear to be created by the borderline record setting winds blowing through or against anything as the noise remained consistent in volume between wind gusts.  Also, being from Wyoming (arguably the windiest state in the country) and having heard a lot of wind against a lot of different things, this hum was still like nothing I’ve heard before.  I checked the skies around the house, but it was overcast and all I could see was the glow of the Denver lights bouncing off of the cloud deck.  But considering the fight or flight response that sound was eliciting from me, I’m glad I didn’t see anything if I’m honest.  My every instinct was telling me to get as far away as fast as possible.  It’s worth noting that the hum was higher pitched and seemed to alternate between 2 tones.  It scared the hell out of me but oddly the sound was kind of pretty in a way.  I’ve found a lot of reports online of a “hum” that detailed a really low pitch that almost chimes, but this was nothing like that and was both several octaves higher and constant.	Also conferred with my next door neighbors.  They woke up from the wind at about the same time that I did and also heard the noise, but they’re pretty heavy sleepers and fell back asleep pretty quickly without giving it much attention.  To be more specific, it didn’t occur to them that they heard a sound until I brought it up a few days later.  I stayed up and listened to the hum until about 5:30am before falling back asleep myself.  As far as I can tell, no one has reported this to anyone.	I’m prior military and a fairly level headed person.  So far, nothing has ever made the hair stand up on the back of my neck like that hum.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It seemed like it was not that high (in our skies/atmosphere like any other pane would be...but this was no plane)  It was 4-5 times as big as any plane I have seen flying over me and I am 51 years old.  It was completely silent and I was looking up a little to the coast but almost over my neighboring suburb.  It was not like it was far away and just a dot or fast squiggle, this was a triangular aircraft that flew smoothly and silently in a straight line down our coast/over land coast side of Perth city. This aircraft operated on a completely level than anything I have seen before.  IF it was a government aircraft, that scares me more than if it was extraterrestrial.  I watched it from the top of my driveway through the sky southward until it was too small to see (on the horizon that you can see over the house across the road, quite a long way) and it traveled that in about 10 or so seconds.

Behind this group there is a V or triangular shaped formation of 3 lights that look just as if they came out of a welder's torch or a soldering gun.I walked over to talk to a woman that was looking through the trunk of her car and said do you see what is going on over here.  She joined me for about 15 minutes as we observed this group of brightly lit objects.  She was very concerned and totally amazed at what she was seeing and had never seen anything like this before.  There were two large objects about 200 yards apart with approximately 7 to 10 objects in between these 2 large objects. It looked like these objects were swarming in between these 2 large brightly lit objects like bees swarming around a hive.  All of these lights looked the same except they varied in brightness.  These objects looked like they wanted to be seen and were totally cluttering up this small area with no attempt to cloak themselves or become dimmer.  This concerned neighbor and I were looking at this object on the far left of this formation for 10 to 15 minutes and could not make out any specific shape to it, except to say that it had streams of light coming of it, and that it looked like an oblong ""lava lamp"".   Finally this object on the left began to strobe or blink and started heading southwest toward Mt. Tamalpais area with all the other objects following.  My neighbor said this was going to be bothering her and she was going to be thinking about this all night long and was going to be upset if this was not talked about on the news.I told her I witnessed a crazy amount of activity the night before but the activity was farther away and out over the bay near San Rafael.",Duration:25 minutes,"Location: San Anselmo, CA",Occurred : 1/6/2017 19:00  (Entered as : 1-06-17 19:00),Posted: 1/12/2017,Reported: 1/9/2017 12:00:09 PM 12:00,Shape: Formation

There was also a small Cessna type aircraft buzzing up and down the coast.These five aircraft at first seemed small, but then it appeared they were all very large, seen at a distance of a quarter mile.  They were somehow very dark, too dark to identify any markings despite the bright sun overhead.  They looked like large bombers in shape, but then again, not.  Very hard to describe their shape.  Kind-of like military planes but kind-of not.  They looked more like some sort of squashed plane, with a short nose and squat wings, but very large.

1147,"White-green-orange ""fire balls"" forming triangluar formation's, etc..INTRODUCTION: As witnessed once before  on 05-04-2012 at approx. 2225 hours by myself (see report submitted 05/13/2012 – Santa Fe, Texas) under the same ideal circumstances, while on my way to work as a police officer in Galveston, Texas, I see these strange lights in the eastern sky again.DETAILS:  As stated above, it was after dark at approx. 7:30 P.M.  While on my way to work an extra (side) job this time as a police officer from my home 23 miles away.  I have watched the sky's ever since the first time I saw these things, perplexed for the longest time and wondering if I'd ever see them again?  There's a whole lot of increased air traffic than ever before these days including military being this close to N.A.S.A. and the commercial air ports, etc. in and around Houston, Texas, which is what's always draws my attention especially after dark.  This is what initially got my attention tonight, more than usual of which I was able to tell the difference between fixed wing air craft and helicopter's circling and crisscrossing the night sky in a grid search like pattern would be the only way I could put it?  As if they were obviously attempting to either identify, locate, photograph, video, intercept, engage if necessary/even possible, or even perhaps the source themselves for these strange lights?  I'm not saying they were, however I strongly suspect said air craft seeking out these strange lights were of our  military in nature rather than commercial?  Especially regarding the recent crash 3-5 days  ago of one of The U.S. Army's Apache I believe it was,  Helicopter's , killing the only two Air National Guardsmen aboard, either in The Galveston Bay or The Gulf itself I cant recall at this time? I have yet to follow up on whats to be known of that?  One of several flying routine patrol's it appears post 911 and awful  low along the edge's of The Gulf at night as if they're either expecting or suspecting something?  I was on a different road way (State Highway 517 in Dickinson) this time, the next town to the north of Santa Fe but parallel's High Way 1764 regarding where I saw the strange lights in 2012.  Trying to pay attention to my driving and watch the night sky's at the same time in scanning the south eastern sky's  at, about, or over The Gu! lf of Mexico, BAM!  There they were again.  Only this time I was! some wh at prepared.  I had a camera in the car for this very reason of which I will work on getting a copy of a 55 second some what  decent video to you at N.U.F.O.R.C., you tube, etc.  if I can the first chance I get .DISCRIPTION OF STRANGE LIGHTS:  The only thing different regarding these strange “orbs of light” - “fire balls”, etc. were the formation and color.  As personally seen before and by hundred's of others world wide it seems, were some of the very same “orange” in color.  This time, they appeared predominantly all white, to green and orange forming two separate triangular in nature type pattern's of 5 each with approx. another 8-9 that I could count from the video I took scattered about all of which, acting in what has become an all too familiar way as described, photographed, videoed, etc. in the way they come and go and distinct formations.  I personally am so tired of seeing and/or hearing main stream media and other obstructionist type individuals all to often willing to write something off they can not easily explain away as these stupid “Chinese Lantern's”, ""flare's"" of some sort, etc. being the reason why I took the time in constructing and submitting this report.  I feel safe in stating in what we do know is, THIS IS NOT, what they are, period.

The objects, which were white, widely spaced, tiny pricks of light in an otherwise perfectly blue, clear sky moved in unison, with no visible difference in speed between them.  They were barely visible to the naked eye.  Polarized sun glasses helped make them much more visible due to their ability to darken the blue sky.  They moved out of sight to the east and moved in a very straight line the entire time of the observation.  Prevailing winds were light and westerly.  I photographed the objects with my full frame DSLR and was barely able to fit the objects in the same frame at 165mm focal length.I may have been content to believe they were balloons, but, approximately 8 or 10 minutes later, the same, or very similar objects were observed moving from north to south in very close formation, they were right next to each other.

So I waited for that one to pass but before I knew it I was there for over 45 minuets just watching these objects go from one side of my window to the other.

1235,"Two triangular shaped crafts that blinked out.Last night I took my dog outside around 10 pm.  I live on the edge of the city near a heavily wooded area, so it’s usually pretty dark as we don’t have street lights.  A few moments after stepping outside, I noticed there was a light blinking through the tree line at the very top towards the south.  I thought it might have been an airplane or helicopter passing by.  I disregarded it, really, until a few minutes later when the lights and object finally appeared over the trees.  The best way I can describe it that the 3 lights on it formed a triangle.  The lights pulsed very softly and would change between a bright white and blue every few seconds.  The lights hovered there for around an hour until they started blinking more rapidly and the craft started moving in a wide circle around the trees.  I would guess that it was making a ½ mile loop.  I ended up taking my dog inside because he was so unsettled that he started to shake and at one point tried to slip out of his collar to get off the leash. I bring this up because he's a very well-mannered, calm dog and usually enjoys being outside.A few minutes later, a second triangle shape approached from the north.  The two triangles approached each other and hoovered very close to each other for just a few minutes before the first triangle completely blinked out.  The second triangle then moved closer to the tree line (where the first one had sat after coming out from behind the trees).  It stayed there for around 45 minutes, pulsing softly.  Around midnight, the lights started glowing brighter and then all three lights seemed to move and meet until they formed one bright light that blinked out.While I do believe in aliens and the like, I normally wouldn’t say anything, except that my neighbors also witnessed this and brought it up this morning as I was leaving for work.  They said that their child had woken them up very disturbed by the lights and had cried until both sets had disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Seemed like a plane, since it had those red & green lights on the ends, but it then I start noticing that it also had light on top, that changed colors in a pulse of blue, green, red, purple.At this same time, the bright white light started to dim. I had to get my eyes back on the highway for a bit then I searched for it again but I couldn't find it again.  I scanned the area in the sky where I spotted it.

1249,"A single, zig-zagging light spotted in December, and again in the months thereafter. Also, in March, two of the lights seen at once.The object, seen through my window while I lay in bed early in the morning, initially appeared to be a bright star or possibly a planet.  It was blinking white, red, blue, and green in color.  Suddenly it began to move as if it were almost vibrating, but then the movements became more obvious–it moved up and down, side to side, and would zig-zag through the sky before it would stop and stay still like a star again.If I watched long enough, it would begin to move again, in the same manner. It was so captivating and interesting that I had somehow unwaveringly watched it for four straight hours before I had to pull myself away to get some sleep.The following week, I woke up around the same time and saw the same thing.  A single star-like object in the sky, blinking white and different colors, and moving in strange patterns for brief periods of time.  I continued to watch this object in the sky in the early morning every few weeks, always in a similar place in the sky.  Sometimes, when I would first notice it, I would doubt my earlier sightings (blaming it on my eyes or thinking perhaps I had imagined it), yet if I watched long enough, the object would begin to move and blink as it had before.On Thursday, March 29, 2017, I woke around 2:00 to see TWO star-like lights parallel to each other in the sky.  The first was in the same area in the sky as usual and the second was a little to the left. Initially, I thought maybe the second light was just a star, but suddenly both of the lights began moving exactly the same way.  This led me to believe that the lights could be on opposite ends of a large craft, but later the lights began to move differently than each other.  Sometimes they would move in opposite directions, but sometimes they would rush close together before vibrating away and then pausing in the sky.  This sighting was perhaps more spectacular than the other mornings, since I had never seen more than one at a time!  As I am writing this, I notice that the two dates I know for SURE I saw these crafts (I have a journal entry from the first sighting in December and for last week's sighting, so I know what days those sightings were on, but I didn't write anything for the other sightings) are both on the 29th of the month.  This could be a coincidence, but I wonder if the other times I sighted the craft that I didn't document the date for could possibly be on the 29th of the month as well.  If so, perhaps this coincides with some planetary cycle that could explain the light, rather than something extra-terrestrial.  I will continue to watch for the lights.  If I see any between now and April 29th, I will make another report.As for my background, I'm only a high schooler.  I don't have any qualifications that would lead me to be more trustworthy, but I am telling the truth of my experiences.  I would love to know if there is any information on similar sightings!  Also, an idea occurred to me the day after my sighting of two lights at once.  I set my camera's f-stop and ISO so that if I were to take a picture of a moving light at night, the photo would show the path of that light's motion.  I have arranged my camera on a tripod near the window I see the lights out of, and I hope to capture the lights next time I see them.

1254,"Cone Shaped changing colors & bright white disc bursting orange lightMy husband and I love star gazing, own a telescope, and are very familiar with the ufo phenomenon.  For a few weeks now we have noticed these amazing lights in the sky.  We decided to try and catch them on camera.  Unfortunately, we only have a cheap Android phone, so we used it to our best ability before the crafts were gone and the phone lost battery.  To get a closer look, we set up our stakeout on our roof.  After a cold night and hours later, it appeared again like it had nights before.  It began as a circle bright white light moving from south to the north quite faster than anything we had ever seen then it suddenly stopped a few blocks away and hovered over a house for only 2 seconds (as we are scrambling for the camera its light begins to get brighter and turning bright orange and then takes off so quickly back south) we didn't catch footage of this one. But we thought we could stay longer and see if it returns.  Well to our surprise another craft flew by maybe an hour later.  This one looked much different.  It was almost cone shaped (like the orange caution cones) with a bright green light at the top as it was sort of descending down it began to pick up speed again and in the video you can hear me say its not green anymore. Suddenly, it zoomed off to the east were the sun was still rising changing to a bright yellow light.  The oddest part about this is the way it would dissapear an then flash the light ever 2 seconds.

1259,"3 objects spotted separately, shaft of light aimed at one of them.	Having never seen anything like this before, I feel like I may be a bit crazy.  I have been watching a lot of Ancient Aliens and listening to Coast To Coast nightly, but that fact has no bearing on what I actually saw this morning.	I am a truck driver, and I drive the same route every night, which takes me from Bloomington, Illinois, up Interstate 39 to Plover, Wisconsin, and back.  This gives an idea of approximately where I may have been in relation to towns or cities, as I wasn’t exactly sure what towns are around the objects I saw.  I do know that the first one was seen in southern Wisconsin, close to the border, probably around the 170-mile-marker or so, before getting on the toll way.	As I have not seen anything like this, it’s difficult to describe, but I will admit that the first and third objects could have easily been airplanes seen from a distance, but I do not think they were.   All three objects were orange in color, all seen from a distance as I was driving, so I couldn’t keep my eyes fully trained on them.	The first one, which was seen around 4:30 A.M. CST, at first did look like it was possibly an airplane coming in for a landing, as it was descending, but when it did a zigzag movement while in descent, I realized I may have seen something not operated by humans.   I know that some military airplanes could pull off a zigzag pattern, but the way it moved while also descending was a bit strange.  I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and being an air winger, I frequently witnessed maneuvers by Hornets, EA-6Bs, Harriers, Ospreys, and others.  I never saw any of those things, including helicopters, do anything like what I saw.  Eventually, it got too low and was hidden behind the tree line of the Interstate.  I tried to keep an eye out for it to pop up again, but it didn’t.	The second object was much higher in the night sky, around 5:15 A.M. CST, and was much further away from me than the first was.  I was driving south, and I first saw it almost directly in front of me.  It seemed at first to be moving very slowly east, then sped up a bit.  Up until this point, I didn’t think the first object was enough to file a report, as I stated that it could have easily been an airplane, even with the odd zigzag move, but what happened while watching the second one actually astonished me quite a bit.  After it sped up a bit, I saw a quick shaft of light.  This light was not bright or flashy, and it only lasted a split second, maybe a quarter of a second at the most.  It was like a lightning bolt, but rather than going from the ground to the sky, this bolt came from the sky and was aimed directly at the craft.  Also, it wasn’t jagged like a bolt of lightning, but rather it was straight, like something was beamed from space to the craft.  I have never hear! d or read of anyone seeing anything like this before, so maybe I really am crazy.  Anyway, after this beam to the craft, it kept on moving in an easterly direction and I lost it as it kept going.The third object was spotted around 5:45 A.M. CST, and this was the least eventful of the three.  I also saw this one coming from the south, or at least that’s where I spotted it since I was driving south.  This one traveled at a leisurely pace for the most part, speeding up one time, but slowing back down soon after.  This one didn’t do anything odd, but also went in an east direction, where I lost it in the twilight of the rising sun.	Honestly, of the three things I saw, I really don’t know if any of them was actually extra terrestrial, but they could be.  That’s why I wanted to report them.  I’m truly interested if anyone else saw the shaft of light to the second craft I saw, or if anyone has ever reported such a thing before.",Duration:2 hours,"Location: Multiple, IL",Occurred : 12/28/2016 05:00  (Entered as : 12/28/2016 05:00),Posted: 12/30/2016,Reported: 12/28/2016 7:32:18 AM 07:32,Shape: Light

I pulled over and got out of my car and continued to watch as it got higher in the western sky,  it remained reddish orange and appeared to vary in intensity like a fire or flare that flickers, sort of like seeing a campfire at a great distance.Then the object slowed and appeared to hover and meander a bit in it's position.  Then it slowly reversed course and headed back towards the west-northwest, and at the same time it changed course it also dimmed greatly and became hard to see, and now appeared whitish and very dim, slowly fading to where I could no longer see it.

I noticed a strange flash of white light towards the southwest part of the sky and began watching for it again.  It flashed again around 10 seconds later but flashed in an irregular way now in a blue and red beam of movement like a very slow motion trail.  It continued to flash mostly either faint or extremely bright flashes of white light with no pattern or rhythm of flashing, and once in a blue moon it had the flash of blue and red again similar to a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere but in a more controlled way.  It inched slowly across the sky from west to east in a horizontal direction until disappearing behind the trees.It moved much too slow to be an airplane, satellite, or the ISS.  It was clearly in the sky and not out in space, and guessing roughly it was probably 5-10,000 feet off the ground; perhaps a 1/2 a mile to a mile from our location.  In about 15-20 minutes it had moved so slowly that it only covered about 10 feet of the sky from our point of view.

1263,"Bright light hovering in sky at night with rotating ""fan"" around.  The light at the center of object changed brightness.My cousin and I were driving around our ranch 30 miles south of the town of Texhoma in the Panhandle of Texas on the night of December 27th, 2016, from about 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  Below is a detailed account of an object we saw in the sky that night. I will email videos.At about 7:15 p.m., I commented on how bright the stars were to my cousin and while looking at the sky I noticed a bright light in the west-northwest direction from us that was too large and too bright to be a star in the sky.  I commented on it, but my cousin and I didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was a plane passing through.  A few minutes passed by, and I turned my attention back to the stars and noticed the light again.  It didn’t appear to have moved from when I initially saw it just a few minutes before.  We talked about how that was kind of odd so we watched it for maybe 2-3 minutes.  It was hard to gauge the distance between us and the object being that it was already dark outside.  I would estimate it was somewhere around 5-10 miles away.  The object appeared to be moving but at a pretty slow pace.  At this point in the night the object looked like a big circular bright light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD))We quickly lost interest in the object again and ended up driving about 40 miles north to another ranch of ours located on the north side of Texhoma.  It was about 8:15 p.m. and I looked up to the sky and saw the object again.  It was in the west-southwest part of the sky at this point, which makes me think it did not move a whole lot.  It was noticeably closer making it much bigger and brighter than just an hour before.  My cousin and I both witnessed this and we also noticed that there appeared to be something spinning around the light.  It appeared to be like a fan or a mill and it was moving very fast around the circular light but it was not lit up so it wasn’t as clear.  This really got our attention so we pulled over and got out to watch it for around 20 minutes.  It was moving back and forth at the same slow pace but not getting much closer to us or following any sort of pattern.  The light was a whitish yellow with instances of slow and subtle hues of red and orange.  It appeared to change brightness and sometimes the circle would get bigger and the light would be less concentrated and then it would almost insta! ntly shr ink to about half its size and at the same time become much brighter.  After looking at it in awe for around 20 minutes we got back in the vehicle and started driving back to town.  We began going west directly at the light but it appeared further and further away as we headed directly toward it.  We then hit the main highway and hopped on it going south back to town for the night.  The object faded off into the distance behind us.The only thing that I can think of in this part of the world that would be that high in the sky are the grain elevators, which have lights on them.  However they have many lights all over them.  I am stumped.  I can confidently say it was a flying object.  However, I have never seen anything like it and I have seen thousands of planes go over our land in the day and at night in complete darkness.  I was able to snap a couple pictures and videos of the object while at the ranch north of town.  I will email to the address provided on the site.

1265,"Bright white orb over Mt Lemmon Tucson AZAround 6pm, caught site of large bright white (sometimes yellow-gold) orb at top of Mt. Lemmon.  Thought it must be a planet just rising over horizon of mountain, though it seemed too far north for a planet, and the sky was overcast so other stars were hazy but this was super bright and pulsing clearly (like a star on the horizon does). Then saw to right of object, probably several miles to the east along top of mountain, a faint small white light rheostat in slowly, then grow brighter, then rheostat to a deep ruby red, get really bright, then switch off suddenly as if a light switch turned it off.  This happened multiple times in sequence of about 1-3 minutes apart.  Occasional flashes of similar red light on the opposite side of the large white/yellow orb, like a light ‘echo’, not as ‘solid’ but there just the same.  The phenomena was persisting so long, I drove up to Sabino Canyon for a closer look but the sky there was dark and couldn’t get as panoramic a view of the range.  Nothing happening there.  Around 8pm when I returned to original location of siting (farther from the range where you can get a broader view of entire top of Mt. Lemmon), there it was again, the bright orb, as if it hadn’t moved (and a planet would have moved in 2 hours)! My memory isn’t precise but for the next 5 minutes or so, what a light show!  The bright white orb blinked out, then suddenly reappeared.  Blinked out then reappeared.  Then moved super-fast to the right about ¼ inch (viewed from several miles distant).  Then blinked out.   Then reappeared.  There was almost a dance between this larger light and the smaller red lights. A lot of movement, blinking in and out.  It is hard to recall details but all I could think was “this ain’t no planet”.  There are radio signal towers on Mt Lemon but they pulse and stay turned on all the time, and they are in a different location from where I saw the red lights.  These smaller red lights were shutting off completely, then phasing back in first as white lights, then as ruby red lights.Then blinking off instantaneously.  The last thing I saw was the white orb rheostat to a beautiful golden yellow, 2x or even 3x its original size and then it looked like it split in half and then it simply disappeared, along with the red lights.

1269,"Solid/Flashing light over the Atlantic Ocean.December 26, 2016.  While on a routine flight from New York to Miami, we saw a very unusual light.  We were in cruise at FL410, Mach .80, unlimited visibility with a temp of -55c, approximately 100NM off the coast near Atlantic City (close to Philadelphia), and on a true course of around 160.  Between 2130-2200 EST.I looked up I saw a very large and bright flashing light, which I brought to the other pilot’s attention.  His response when seeing it was pretty much the same as mine…. “What in the hell”… “What is that?”  The size of course is hard to tell.  The other pilot explains it as 3-4 times the size of the largest star around.  I think it was 4-5x.  The object was approximately 25-30 degrees up from our line of sight when I first saw it.  Its range of motion was between the horizon (from what I could see) to around 35 degrees up from our line of sight.  At first sight the light was approximately at our 1 o’clock position.  It moved to 12, 10, 11, back to 12.  At that time, the light appeared to move North, then south, at a pretty rapid rate.  Or I would describe it as closer and further from our position as the size seemed to get larger and smaller.  The light ended in the 1st position and then moved out east and once at our 10 o’clock position disappeared.  The other pilot stated he could see an! orange/red flash in between the white flashes.  We did flash our lights at it a few times and the other pilot believes it flashed back in sequence, I felt the return flashes were probably coincidental, but possible.  The flashing didn’t really appear to have any pattern.  The whole incident lasted a minimum of 10 minutes.Neither one of use have ever seen and/or heard of an occurrence like this.  We were going to report it to ATC, but mutually decided to let it be.  I have no explanation for what we saw nor does the other pilot.

1274,"3 red orbs seen over Blaine Wa.This sighting happened on Xmas evening Dec 25, 2016.  Our family had gone to Xmas dinner at a hotel in downtown Vancouver.  At approximately 10:30 pm we returned home and were in our family room, when my son said hey dad look at the bright red light outside.  I thought he was kidding around, but when I looked out the window sure enough there was a large red orb sitting stationary over Blaine, Washington.  We live in White Rock, BC, overlooking Semiahmoo Bay which faces Blaine.  I quickly grabbed my high power spotting scope to see if I could get a better look to see if there was a definitive shape or hard edges to the object, as it just looked like a red ball.  Even with the scope, that is all it looked like zoomed in.  As I watched, the orb start to ascend,  I noticed another one a bit lower down and to the left appear and was ascending towards the higher one.  After watching for about a minute or so, a 3rd one appeared coming from the Canadian side of the border and it looked like it flew right over the customs border checkpoint at about 300 feet or so off the ground.  As I watched this unfold the first one began to go into a fairly large cloud over Blaine, and as it disappeared, the second had caught up a bit and went into the cloud nearby.  The third started to ascend after I watched it fly level for about half a mile or so and followed the other two into the same approximate area of the cloud.  I watched for quite awhile after they went into the cloud, but they didn’t return.  One thing I noticed was that the sky was totally clear out toward the south except for this cloud over Blaine which I would guess was approx. 1000-1500 feet in altitude.  In hindsight, I regret not videoing instead of looking at them thru the scope.

What caught my attention was the light looked like two lights very close together, then they seemed to be moving right and left very slowly.

1276,"Disappearing craft/craft with capability of being invisible witnessedIt is the evening of December 25, 2016, and though I feel like I may have a great amount of difficulty explaining what I saw, I will do my best to do just that as I find I have been stirred to my core.The night sky is something I spend a lot of time staring up at. Stars, planets, our solar system, the universe, etc. has been of interest to me as long as I can remember.  I also might mention that I live almost at the very top of a hill referred to locally as Eagle's Point, which provides a significantly unaltered view of the Lehigh Valley below me, as well as the many airplanes that come and go from its international airport (ABE). Quite often I find myself trying to distinguish between celestial bodies and man made aircraft - and what I saw this evening was neither of the two.  If it was man made, then it's some kind of black technology or secret NASA project.As I stood in my driveway I looked up and saw something shimmering or flashing in the eastern sky low to the horizon.  This is not what I wish to report.  As I looked away to gain perspective by looking at stars, I noticed what I thought was at first a slower moving shooting star.  But as I focused both of my eyes, the only way I can describe what I saw fly directly over my head and home was a low-flying craft that was either utilizing some sort of malfunctioning invisibility device or was just initializing this device as it flew overhead.  It was completely silent and, though I feel I am struggling again to explain this correctly, it seemed like it was only visible from below.  Do you know how it is when a large plane flies low overhead (like at an airport) and is so low that you struggle to make out the whole form until it is moving further away from you?  It was like that, except as it moved further from me (at a quick pace), though I kept expecting that I'd be able to get a better view, it just seemed to vanish.It was the strangest thing.  It wasn't like I could see an actual craft or anything. It was more like... a disambiguation(?) of the sky in what I can best describe as an aerodynamic form.  Maybe like the shape of a triangle, but not a perfect one; a longer one.I'm honestly not sure.  My instincts are telling me to question what I saw, but this is not something that I'm in any way unsure of seeing.Feel free to contact me. I feel like I will never find out for sure what I saw tonight, but I'm quite sure it won't leave my thoughts any time soon.  I'm a college-educated guy, pretty well-rounded in my own opinion.

1295,"5 Orangish-red spheres traveling east to west in a row over Port Orange, Florida (Daytona Beach area) Dec 24, 2016I saw five orangish-red twinkling round objects in the evening sky around 20:30 - 21:00 traveling in a straight line from horizon to horizon, equal distance apart from east to west on Christmas Eve 2016.  Each object appeared to be at least 1000 feet in altitude and were traveling at a constant speed, except for the middle one which seemed to slow slightly before disappearing.  Each light twinkled and had the same illuminosity until the light faded somewhere over or near the Spruce Creek Fly-In Airport.  The light source acted like a looping (repeating) laser projection, although the cloud deck was broken or scarce that evening.  The only other conclusion I could reach was that the objects were highly illegal drones which had situational awareness of one another.

1305,"First 4 and then 5 objects. The four were in a diamond formation. 11 hours missing time.Christmas Eve 12:19 AM. 2016. Getting ready for bed.I'm home alone because I don't travel well. I remember the time, because I was hearing the words ""Help. Please Help. Need assistance"". Over and over again. As I have studied the phenomenon for decades now, I knew there were things I needed to do.I jotted down the time (To see if I could find a normal explanation later).I responded in my head, ""I am coming to give whatever help I can"".STRANGENESS And from 1 moment to the next.  I was PHYSICALLY IN MY YARD.  But I am a disabled man.  I can stand, I just can't move very quickly.  It was bitterly cold that night, yet I was perfectly warm.THE OBJECTS I found myself looking up at four ""objects"" in a formation that was very ""Clock-like"", except that there were diamond shaped craft where the numbers usually are.  The craft that was virtually screaming for assistance was at the 9 o clock position.  This craft seemed to be having difficulty maintaining altitude, as it would change color from the brilliant blue that lit up my entire backyard, to almost a blood red type of color.  Every time it shifted color, it dropped straight down out of formation.  It got lower and lower.I was fully awake and alarmed at this time as I was full aware of what might be happening right in front of me!  Every time it dropped, the other 3 craft would brighten in intensity and the ""distressed"" craft would begin to rise again.  I projected nothing but positive thoughts and hopes as I would do at an airshow when it would look like a craft was in danger.  I was rooting for it's safety as I would ANY other living beings.At that point, a FIFTH ship appeared out of nowhere right next to the craft that was in distress.  I felt waves of gratitude from every ship and it was over.STRANGENESS When I realized I was getting cold, I also realized something else. It was approximately 11 hours later and the Sun was out.(You'll read I have adopted the ""Strangeness"" nomenclature. So far, the Military Industrial Complex has not been able to do many things our ""friends"" can.  Tracking for these things help me form my own opinion).It had now gone from 12:19 Am to 10:40AM with the daylight shining.  I had lost 11 hours I have no recollection of.STRANGENESS  Every TV in the house was on! EVEN THE TV's that had no electricity.  The TV sets that actually had remote controls would turn off as normal when I pressed the power button.  It took me a few minutes due to being rattled, but I finally figured out if I plugged the set into any outlet, and then unplugged it again, the set would remain off.Notes At NO TIME did I have any fear for my safety.I could not make much detail out other than color and general shape.I thought they might be Sikorski's latest sports model so I want to know ON if I saw one again.During the 11 missing hours.  No question about it.  I would have died from exposure.  Like I said, I made the decision to help at the same time I grabbed my robe.  That remained the only clothes I had on.What I am hoping to do is to give other witnesses of this event, or ones like it, to come foreword.I wish to assure you that what you think you saw happen, really happened (That's what's emotionally bothering me the most right now).

I then went to google and googled astronomy events and all i could find was that Jupiter was near waning crescent moon at 1am this morning.  I could find nothing about what I was seeing.  I went back out and watched some more and it was just a big stationary light. At no time did i think this was a Helicopter as I see those all the time with there spot lights on.

1399,"I saw orange lights that split into multiple lights while moving in an odd patterns unlike conventional aircraftDecember 13, 2016, I've only seen this a couple times in my life...Today it happened again, had thank god I was not alone this time!  My mother and I were driving northbound on I-75 heading toward Home and taking notice of the sunset to our left (west) and the moon rising on our right (east).  I was compelled to look up the moon cycle and see if it was a full moon... it was ""Cold Moon"" full moon according to the iPhone ... I watched it as it got higher in the sky.  As our driving and conversing continued, I kept watching the moon; by the time we got off the expressway and had made our way to US-23/M-65 for a bathroom break it was pretty bright, but smaller and it had lost its reddish tint.  Northbound on M-65 I kept my eye on it.  I remember commenting on it as it was so bright that it appeared to be in front of the clouds - I could imagine primitive earth dwellers staring in awe thinking this ball of moon was actually in our sky.  This was not at all the strange part, that I am about to tell you...We were just about home.  We had been through town, and were nearing the section of M-65 within the mile or so before the road we live on.  I was still keeping my eye on the moon, it was real pretty tonight.  I spotted what I thought was a plane, but its flashing pattern was in short bursts, almost like a camera flashing.  It was coming from the west, but its flight was also not ""straight,"" so I mentioned to my mom who was driving that I though there might be a drone up there taking pictures (also thinking it was a silly time for a drone to take pictures - its dark out)... and then as I was adjusting my head to try to see better I saw a brighter orange light almost above us.  I was seeing it through the windshield and in the part of the window at the very top where it was almost out of view and I almost passed it off as a trick of light from another car.  I looked back to where I had seen the drone/plane and it was still in the general place it was, but not exactly, like I said, its flight pattern was odd and certainly not just heading east to west.  Then I saw the orange light again and this time it was half the distance toward the other objects direction... it disappeared almost as quickly  as I saw it.  We were real close to ponderosa drive now and slowing down. It reappeared.  Not in the same spot, but close.  The other object is still flashing like a camera. The pattern of the flash was very random.  I asked my mom to stop on the corner so I can look without the car moving... by this time she has become aware of what I am seeing and has seen the orange light appear and disappear I believe at least once.We start heading back down ponderosa the rest of the way and the light has become more than one light counting 2, 3, ?  Disappearing and there is clear subtle movement between the orange lights.  I ask my mom to stop the car again an I got out to watch it from outside the car and try to get the iPhone to video it... we have both witnessed the light reappear and become three lights and move a little - I'm saying to mom out loud at this point ""this is just like the stuff we see on the UFO shows on TV ma"" - she's replying to me but I won't try and quote it cause I'm too busy trying to get the video and this is when I notice the two jets from westerly and northeasterly sky (I hear them more than I see them) - at this point I am taking mental note of the following objects I have seen... the drone/plane which at this point I believe to have seen more than one, however the orange reappearing lights have become my main concern... and the two jets.I tell my mom that I am glad she was here to witness this with me.

1402,"Immobile, post-like object over deep water in the Atlantic Ocean.I was aboard the Holland America cruise-ship, Eurodam.  Most of that afternoon, I had been sitting in a deck chair, watching the sea through which we were passing about one hundred miles off Cuba's east coast, bound for the Bahama island of Grand Turk, where we would arrive the following morning.  All that day, Tuesday, I saw no floating debris, signs of marine life, or seaweed, until precisely 17:00 hours (5:00 p.m., ship's time). 				 At first to the left of my perspective (I was looking due south), I observed an object that resembled the top of a post standing above the surface of the ocean, within thirty-five to forty feet out from the starboard side of our vessel.  It stood three to four feet high, was approximately eighteen inches in diameter, seemed entirely round, with a tapering, rounded top; was uniformly featureless and dark in color, perhaps black; in shape, it somewhat resembled a human thumb.  Most remarkably, the object was absolutely rooted in place, completely unmoving, as those driven solidly into the seabed, about two thousand feet under the Eurodam 's keel.  The object was not afloat or bobbing with the waves, which instead broke around it, and never altered its unchanging position during the five or six seconds I kept it in view.  For a moment, I suspected that it may have been the periscope of a passing submarine, but almost instantaneously dismissed such an interpretation, because no sub commander would so gravely risk his vessel by taking it within forty feet of the Eurodam's extremely turbulent wake.  No other debris, etc. was observed on the surface of the sea the rest of that day.  I forwarded a written description of the Tuesday sighting to our Captain, explaining my concern that the object may have been a navigational hazard of some kind.

1409,"Shifting orb witnessed at Stevens Pass, WA.After a day of skiing at Stevens Pass, I was staying the night at the ski resort with some friends in the RV lot so we could ski the following day.  Around 7:00p.m we left our camper and walked to the main base area of the resort.  Skiing operations closed at 4:00 that day and the mountain was dark, but the base area was illuminated, and we used this lighting to play a game of cornhole (beanbag toss game) right in the main courtyard area next to the lodge and clock tower.  It was a very cold night with broken clouds and occasional snow showers.  We were the only ones outside in the area.  It was the night before a full moon and the moon looked amazing with the small broken clouds moving quickly past it.  Having the place to ourselves with the resort lodges and clock tower decorated in Christmas lights and the full moon in the backdrop, I tried my best to get a picture with my phone that captured the whole scene.  To do this I stepped about thirty feet away from my friends, took a knee and held my phone at an angle that got all three of my friends in the frame as well as the moon (this was tricky and you will see that in a couple shots either a friend or the moon gets cut off).  Once I had the correct angle I waited for gaps in the clouds as they passed over the moon.  After snapping a couple photos, I first noticed the object in the screen of my phone.	The object first appeared as a blotch of white light in the screen of my phone.  It seemed like a morphing light ball with a bright core surrounded by a duller light and was very fluid yet erratic in its movements.  If I had to guess I would say the core was the size of a large grapefruit and the outer layer the size of a beach ball.  It was like a luminescent aerial jellyfish.  The object first appeared in the sky around the trees in the background and moved toward us.  It came as close as the clock tower (the photo showing the object in front of the lodge verifies its proximity).  At this point, I looked up from the camera, where the image was very bright, however with my bare eyes I could only see the outer dull light, but the inner bright sphere was still visible in the screen of my phone.  Put another way:  With my bare eyes, the object was not very noticeable and I might have not noticed it.  At the same time it was glowing even brighter than what was captured by the camera on the screen of my phone.  At one point most of my screen went white.  I was really confused and rendered speechless.  At this point I stood up and pivoted my whole focus to the object.  As soon as I did the object shot off to the trees behind the lodge, paused near the top for one to two seconds and then shot off over Big Chief Mountain at impossible speed and was gone.  As you can see in the pictures, my friends were oblivious of its presence and I wasn’t able to process what I was seeing in time to verbalize what I was seeing.  By the time I did, it was gone.  I still really have no idea what I saw and the photos just add to the mystery.

It seemed to climb at a very steep rate, but with not so much horizontal movement.  Eventually it climbed altitude out of sight.There are many national guard helicopters that fly over this area all the time and I am used to seeing them and understand the difference.  It was not an airplane, as planes cannot go west then east on which seems to be almost identical course.

I was facing east and I saw something moving across the sky in a south by southwest direction, so it was moving from my left to my right at an angle from in front of me to behind me.  It stopped me in my tracks because I had never seen anything like it in the sky before.The object appeared to be the size and shape of a Tylenol extra strength tablet. It had lights on the front and back.  The lights appeared to be fluttering like in a haze.  The object appeared to be gliding across the sky at a pretty high speed, and there was no noise that I could hear.It took me a few seconds to compute what I was looking at, and I was able to rule out many explanations in my mind.  It was not an airlines jet, it was to big in the sky and no airport in that direction.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter behind the clouds, but a quick look around and I could see many stars and constellations, so I quickly ruled out cloud cover.  The absence of noise also helped me rule out a helicopter, as well as a military jet, which do fly in our area but are very noisy.  The lights were not flashing like the normal air traffic in the sky.  The lights were dull and hazy like they were fluttering.I then got my cellphone out to video.

My wife and I were walking down the beach just outside of Platanias star gazing.  It’s a small village West of the city of Chania on the island of Crete in Greece.  I saw something out of the corner of my eye to the right (on the land side not over the ocean) and it was some kind of craft clear as day.  It was odd shaped.  Definitely closer to a saucer than any other shape but much wider in the middle than the stereotypical ones you see in movies and the edges were more rounded.  It was covered with lights around the middle and on the bottom but they weren’t the same.  Some of them were brighter than others and some were clearly different colors.  I distinctly remember seeing some shades of red but it was mainly yellow light like from a light bulb.I was in the Army a long time and have seen many different aircraft and it wasn’t anything of ours.  It’s hard to say exactly how far away it was because it’s hard to judge the distance and size of something when it’s in the air at night, but if I had to guess it appeared to be maybe 3 or 4 city blocks away, approximately 100-150 feet off of the ground, relative to the houses down below.  If you were to take your index finger and thumb and measure about 2.5 to 3 inches between them and hold it at arm’s length away from your face.  That would be about how big it appeared.  My wife and I stood there for a second very confused and then the lights dimmed and it was gone. I didn’t see if zip away or anything, the lights just dimmed to black over the span of a second or so and it was ‘’gone’’ or perhaps just hovering in the dark.  It made zero sound and there was no wind that night to carry off the sound of a chopper.  There is nothing it could have been confused with.  Trust me I’ve tried! my hardest to debunk it.  There are no mountains behind that area and the shape was very clear.The whole event lasted only a few seconds, but I got a very good look at it.  I tried to report it to the government but they don’t accept these things apparently.  I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately and came across this site. I know it’s probably not of any use but I just had to tell someone.  Maybe you collect data to look for patterns or something.  I’m not familiar with this type of stuff.  This isn’t exactly the kind of thing you share with family or friends unless you want them to think you’re nuts.  I was completely sober by the way and I don’t use drugs of any kind.

The objects disappeared and then a gigantic disk shaped object rimmed with spinning lights appeared where the previous lights disappeared, also moving slowly in the same direction.  The size of the object covered approx. 1/2 of the horizon and did not change size as it moved behind the mountain in the distance.  Pre-paid Verizon mobile phone camera not powerful enough to capture anything but a bright planet. I drew pictures of the site and the craft on a piece of notepad paper.  No cloud cover, clear sky, just after sunset.While sitting in my patrol vehicle at the secure site, my coworker exclaimed suddenly to turn out my lights and look behind me.  I noticed the strange pulsating lights moving in an apparent formation to the north.  We both exited our vehicles to watch the lights.  They appeared to cover the entire horizon moving in alternating patterns.  After approx. 3 minutes they all disappeared and at this time we noticed that new lights began to light up, one after another and begin to ""spin"" rapidly.  Each individual light had a trail behind it, and was a blue flame color.  As all of the spinning lights were lit a large ""disc"" shaped object became apparent.  The lights all moved to the left, then right, then from the left side and right side to the center, then left and right again, in apparent patterns.  The ""disc"" was so immense in scale I can only compare it to the ridiculous size of the craft in the movie independence day.

1436,"White/blue bright object travelling west @ 6:30 pm over Pacific Ocean in Lahaina, HI12/10/16 @ 18:30, LAHAINA, HI 96761, I spotted one object above the Pacific Ocean for a total of approximately 3 minutes, then it was out of my view, as I was driving the opposite direction.I was driving on Hwy-30 coming from the West of Lahaina, Hawaii, travelling toward the East to Kahului, Hawaii, when I spotted one rectangular object above the Pacific Ocean with solid white running lights across the length of it, and streaming blue lights below the white running lights.  The solid white lights were very bright.  The streaming blue lights below as if toward the ocean, were the color blue police cars use on top of their vehicles.I spotted it, then it was out of my vision for a few seconds, until I got down from the bypass to the highway and it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling West above the Pacific Ocean.When I got to my destination on the other side of the island, I asked the security guard if anyone coming from Lahaina, Hawaii, reported seeing anything strange in the sky.  The security guard told me 4 people mentioned it to him.I am a retired wordprocessor.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Aloha PeterThanks for getting back to me.As far as size, the best I can compare it to is the length of a plane, at least as long as a plane or maybe a bit longer.  To me, the big bright round lights I would compare to a round floodlight, probably not as large as the moon, but from far away I compare it to a round floodlight.  I hope this helps.  When I was looking at the object while driving, I didn't have to cock my head up high in the sky.  It seemed as if I could just look out at the top of my passenger window to see it.  Another words, I didn't have to look straight up into the sky.  Hope this helps also as to exactly where it appeared to me in the sky.Also, my astrology teacher got back to me and said no one reported the incident to her, darn.  She was really excited about what I saw.Thank you for your help with this exciting object I saw in the night's sky.  Keep up your good work, as I know it takes many, many hours to investigate, but I appreciate what you do Peter!!

1467,"Flashing, strobing bright light at high altitutde performs zig zag like maneuversHi Peter,  On December 07, at 5:15 pm, I went outside to have a cigarette.  It was a clear day and the sun was just going down and it was close to civil twilight.  I noticed a bunched of planes in the sky, then spotted a larger, brighter light just above the horizon.  I quickly grabbed my phone and started recording, as I realized this object seemed stationary, and it was pulsing like no other identifiable craft I have seen.  I watched it for a few minutes and tracked it as it moved in a straight line heading northwest over my head.  I observed and filmed this pulsing object for about six minutes and watched it slowly travel on a straight trajectory heading north west.I looked at other planes in the sky nearby and compared it to what I was watching.  On the planes in the sky you could just barely see the red and green strobe lights and you could see the plane body still lit up by the existing daylight.  This brighter pulsing light  had no visible coloured lights like navigation lights that strobed like aviation lights.  At first I accepted the possibility that it was an aircraft heading straight towards me with the landing lights or collision lights on.  But then noticed it was constantly pulsing, moving very slowly upwards, almost stationary.  I also thought this bright pulsing object was a satellite or maybe the ISS, but it was only 5:16 pm and in the stage civil twilight, it was still not dark enough to see any stars.  This light was as bright as Jupiter or Venus but a bit larger.After watching the video over a couple of times I noticed a peculiar movement as it got over head and thought that the strobing frequency changed but couldn't really calculate it accurately.  At about 30 seconds in, the light seems to changing its speed and direction.  I could calculate that the light deviated from its original straight trajectory.  Judging the distance from the electrical cord hanging down from the eave-trough of the roof that is visible in the second video, you can see that the pulsing object appears to slow down, and then dives down to the left, and then zips back down to the right, and then zips up to the left on its former trajectory.I later stabilized the shaky camera footage and the zig zag movement becomes very clear.I could not see the object clearly at all times while filming the second video as it was over head.  It was heading into some cloud cover and just pointed the phone camera at where I saw it last.  It seemed to be completely behind some clouds so I stopped filming.I had to report this to you at NUFOC.  I heard you on Podcast UFO and think you are the most hardworking guy in the field!

1470,"3 periodic neon blue flashes lighting up entire night sky.  Each time the electicity went out. Incident lasted under 5 mins.On December 6, 2016, at approx 10pm or 11pm 4 Separate households housing 5 witnesses and 2 witnesses sitting outside in a motor vehicle saw the ENTIRE night sky change into a neon blue flash 3 times in a row.  I would compare the flash to lightening, very bright, very blue, very vast and without a strike or thunder.  Three residence are each a several miles in proximity to each other, and certainly not walking distance.  They are too far from each each other for this to have been a simple transformer malfunction and it is no exaggeration that the ENTIRE sky lit up neon blue.  The two people in the car were sitting outside of one of the residence.  This happened as follows: -The entire night sky became a brief Neon flash  accompanied by a vibration (felt by one household) a loud humming (heard by another household)and immediately following the flash the electricity went out. This was experienced by each witness that was at home. After about 15-20 seconds the elect! ric returned. 20 seconds after that the sky flashed neon blue again and the exact things were heard and felt and the electric again went out in the entire area, for approx 15 seconds and then came back on. The third time it happened, which was about 10 seconds later, the lights were off for even lesser of a time, maybe 5 seconds. Each time it seemed as though the flashes and the length of time between flashes and time the electric stayed off and took to come back on got shorter. I myself expected there to be a write up about it in the newspaper the next day.  NOTHING. Nothing on the news.  One observers house rests way up upon a hill overlooking the entire city.  It has giant glass windows in the 'great room'. He said he was fortunate enough to see it happen and view all of the lights in the city area that he is able to see, which is quite large, go out each time the sky flashed.  He also stated that he saw no object in the sky and that the blue light WAS the entire sky and tha! t the blue flash did not appear to have an epicenter.  The following day, December 7, 2016, I contacted New York State Electric and Gas and they told me they had no record of ANY power outages in the area what so ever for the date of December 6, 2016, in Binghamton, NY.(Description of background of observers: #1 whom also heard the loud hum, is a college educated 54 year old female Medical Record Tech. Mother of 2, Grandmother of 7. Has large bedroom window overlooking a small field and then the river. She leaves curtains open due to nice view. #2 and #3 Stay at home mom 26 years old and her 7 year old son, she felt the strong vibration. I am unclear if her son felt the vibration as well, but he came out of his room to tell his mom about the light but she had already seen it. The power outage had interrupted his gaming and he saw the light through black colored room darkening curtains. #4 Successful business owner, 29 year old married male, father of 2.

1471,"Unique Craft Spotted above trees, still motion, strange shape, just observing.I was driving home and noticed some sort of craft way down the road.  As I got closer I noticed that it wasn't moving.  Still I got closer until I was right under it.  It was positioned just off the side of the road about 20-30 feet above the tree line (but not behind the trees, closer to the road). It had to be as big as my car since it appeared the same size that far up.  I paused under it briefly in wonder.  The clouds behind it were lit by the moon perfect, so I could make out the shape.  It was like nothing I've seen or heard described.  It had very short, stout wings, the front end (i guess the cockpit) was bulbous shaped and the back end was shaped like that of a jet (like where the air would come out).  I guess it was shaped like a jet but severely squished.  It had two white lights (like car headlights, but the y didn't shine outward, they just lit up) on each side of the cockpit.  It had a band of read light that went across the middle with a small! red light on each side and the light appeared to move back and forth across that area.  The craft was dark in color.  You could have drawn a parallelogram around the outside of it, if you had to place it in a tangible shape category.  It just stayed in the air, no sound, above me.  I really thought somebody has got to be playing a joke, perhaps so. There was a car coming and it was late so I started to drive.  I watched in my rear view until I couldn't see it anymore.  Just before it went out of view it began to move to my left back towards the wooded area.  I called my husband and he told me to go get a picture (a decision I regret not making immediately now).  So I turned down the back roads.  I believe I saw it again, moving really slow, staying at the same altitude, across a horse pasture (it was too far to get a picture with my phone).  It looked like it was just exploring or observing.  I don't know.  Then it was gone.  I got home immediately and tried to find a drawing or image of the shape I saw.  I couldn't find any drones or plane s that resembled it.  I drew a sketch, but now I just feel crazy and really stupid for not immediately taking a picture while it was perfectly outlined above me.",Duration:,"Location: High Point, NC",Occurred : 12/6/2016 20:45  (Entered as : 12/06/16 20:45),Posted: 12/15/2016,Reported: 12/6/2016 6:47:24 PM 18:47,Shape: Other

I was driving the moving truck and my wife and daughter followed close behind in a separate car.  We were heading north on Hwy 305 (about 10-15 miles north of Austin, NV; around 19:15 on 12/06/16) when I saw, what looked like a really dramatic amber/orange slow moving, falling star in the north sky.  Right out my front windshield.  I immediately radioed my wife (we had picked up some 2-way radios for the trip) and said, ""Quick!  Look in front of us at that shooting-..."".  I didn't finish my sentence because as I was speaking, it began to slow down without fading.  It then came to a stop, pulsated or barely flashed (not very bright, though) and then another one appeared to the right (east) of the original light/object.  About a second later, a third one appeared (again, on the right) and now there were three of them! in a line.  Almost like Orion's Belt.  About a second or two after the appearance of the third and final light, the original one disappeared (like someone turning off a light switch), then the second one followed suite.  The third one, however, made an arcing maneuver towards where the original light was and then disappeared.  My wife (who is going to file a separate report) came over the radio and said what I was thinking, ""That's not a shooting star."" About 10 min later (19:25 or so), I saw a single and same amber/orange light I had seen previously.  This one was higher in the sky; where I had to lean in towards the steering wheel and look up out the front windshield (it seemed to be from the same part of the sky as the original sighting).  This light, however, was very active.  It moved, pretty rapidly, in a horseshoe pattern (from west to east) and then started heading back west before I lost sight of it directly above my truck.  Right after its horseshoe maneuver, I saw a white light (a lot smaller than the amber one) shooting from east to west at an incredible speed, where it disappeared near an aircraft (it was slow moving with the usual green/red blinking lights) that I hadn't noticed until that moment.  I tried to look out my mirrors to see more, but could only see the aircraft.  I radioed my wife during this second sighting as well.  She'll be submitting her report shortly.

1492,"Fast-moving craft with gray lights over suburban Huntington BeachI’d just stepped out of my friend’s house after a comedic session of Dungeons & Dragons. We’d watched TV, talked about video games, the usual for our age group.  A normal Sunday night.  I was the last one to leave.  I didn’t expect to see something in the sky, but then again, I don’t think anyone does.It was one of those rare cloudless nights where LA’s famous light pollution doesn’t ruin a decent view of the stars over the suburbs.  I’m originally from a very small town, so I don’t take celestial beauty for granted.  I looked up at the sky to admire the stars, and that’s when I saw it.My first thought was “airplane,” but this was immediately replaced by “drone?” because it was too fast for a commercial flight, and completely silent.  And then I thought that it couldn’t have been a drone, because again, it was completely silent, and the most common drones are quadcopters.  This thing was in the shape of a chevron, and dark gray.  It was a little larger than the moon, which was slightly farther away.  Another thing that perplexed me besides the speed were the lights.  Three of them, one on each wing end and one under the middle corner, unblinking, and a dim gray.  I’ve never seen gray lights in my life.The chevron was headed southeast, when suddenly, without slowing down, it made a sharp, tight U-turn, pivoted, and disappeared before my eyes.  I didn’t blink, I didn’t look away for a second, and there were no clouds for it to hide behind.  It was there, and then it was gone. I don't think we have the technology to make planes turn the way this thing did.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the young woman who submitted the report, as well as two high-quality illustrations.

1511,"1 dozen light orbs seen over 20 minutes travelling through skySanta Cruz, California, USA 95060  Approximately 4:00pm (16:00) Dec 3, 2016.  The Place and Time, Weather, Orb Count and Equipment  I was standing in my back yard on the Westside of Santa Cruz, California, December 3rd, 2016.  This approximately places me at the Santa Cruz Lighthouse on the cliffs overlooking the Monterey Bay.  It was approximately 4:00pm (having checked my watch a few minutes later at 4:05pm).The sky was mostly clear, and sunset was about an hour away; though the sun, close to the horizon in the west, was hidden behind hazy cloud cover, which I believe I have now identified as wispy Cirrus or Cirrostratus clouds.  These clouds covered about half the sky in the west, breaking up overhead.A couple of wispy Cirrus (I believe) clouds lay 40 degrees over the horizon, East by North East, opposite the low sun, and it was from one of these I saw three bright orbs, seemingly lights, appear, heading South, to the right.  They traversed the distance from my first sight of them to out of sight behind various trees at about East by Southeast, so I had a view of them in the sky for about 45 degrees of the horizon.  They traversed this distance in about 15 seconds.At this time, I called for my girlfriend to get my glasses from inside, my astigmatism causing the first sighting to look distorted and fuzzy.  Bringing them out immediately, she also left and returned briefly with a pair of binoculars (Sans & Streiffe #889 Viking, 8x30mm, field 10& #730;).  We waited for a bit, and then at approximately 4:06pm we saw another single light orb leave the same cloud, heading in the same southerly direction of the others.  This too passed out of sight in about 15 seconds.The next 25 minutes were spent in their entirety by myself scanning the sky for more orbs/lights, and my girlfriend coming outside intermittently and surprisingly being present for most of the orbs.  At no time during this period did I think to take more than one image with my phone, as its picture quality is notoriously awful.  The one I took at approximately 4:04pm was not of orbs, but of the first of two clouds that the orbs apparently came from.  This was for reference, in hopes of understanding how high up they were by the cloud type.  As I mentioned before, I thought these were Cirrus, but they may be medium level clouds. They lacked any of the “fluffy” features found in low level clouds though.  The clouds were clearly either obscuring the orbs as the orbs flew behind them, or in fact were the source of the orbs.  I should say, every time we saw any orbs during this event, they either appeared from behind/within the clouds, or as I'll mention later, materialized next to exi! sting orbs.Every couple of minutes from 4:06pm until approximately 4:15pm, a single orb, or two orbs would appear from within/behind one of the two clouds (whichever was approximately in the position of the first sighting) traveling South, to our right, for about 15 seconds until passing out of sight from our narrow, 45&#730; field of view.  At the end of this period we waited another 5 minutes until it was about 4:20pm without any further sightings in that area of the sky.  My girlfriend headed inside again and I stayed to watch the whole sky now.At approximately 4:21pm, looking directly above me, at the zenith of the sky, I saw the brightest of the orbs, a single orb, also heading South, materialize from within a high cloud bank: these clouds I have researched and I suggest they are Cirrostratus.  Because of the place in the sky it arrived, this orb remained in my view for longer than 20 seconds, being lost to sight behind trees to the south.  From 4:00pm to 4:21pm, both my girlfriend and I guessed that we had seen about 1 dozen orbs, with two groups of three, two groups of two, and the rest single orbs.The Orbs, Their Properties, and the Binoculars   With my glasses on and the Binoculars well adjusted, I watched the orbs singly or in their small flights of two and three. The first group of three, though I didn't have my glasses or the binoculars then, flew in a loose pattern, one ahead of the others by twice the distance from the second and third.  The two that trailed followed at perfect distance, but approximately half way through their short 15 seconds in my field of view, one of the rear objects overflew the other, switching positions.  This appeared to be an smooth, non-linear acceleration and deceleration.  As this was the first sighting, and I didn't have on my glasses to be sure, I thought perhaps they were stunt planes far up, and one was performing a maneuver.  The rapid change of location in the formation however made me second guess my assumption.I'll state here, I have never before seen a UFO; that is, a saucer, ship, craft or other phenomenon which I took to be extraterrestrial or black-ops in origin.  I am, however, keenly interested in the subject of UFO phenomena, and I have researched how these assumed extra terrestrial and/or government vehicles and phenomena behave and move.  What I saw in the first sighting from one of the three orbs immediately alerted me to very improbable behavior for a conventional aircraft.With my glasses on and the binoculars in hand, the third or fourth sighting of orbs, a pair, were clearly visible.  At first, only a single orb flew Southward from the second of the two drifting clouds, but at near half its distance in my field of view, another object appeared next to it; without a snap, more of a quick “fade in”.  It was flying in unison with the first orb, but unlike the first orb, or any of the other orbs seen in this report, it was not totally a ball of light, but had physical definition.  At a distance it looked less bright, and seemed to have a physical form.My perception (through the binoculars) was that it was a dark, hard, physical object, but with a glowing orb obscuring its center.  From my vantage point, given the angle from which I was viewing it, it looked like a glowing orb with two rounded “wings” or structures coming from either side of it, (as the physical parts were extending from the light orb perpendicular to the object's flight path, and seemingly level with the ground plane). On second consideration, I think I was seeing either an oval shaped craft flying parallel to its short axis, or more likely, a disc at an oblique angle.  Either way, it had a bright light in the center which obscured all but the outer thirds of it.  This was all in very small detail on the less-than-powerful binoculars, but allowed for at least some observation. Like the first observation at approximately 4:00pm, this darker, “physical” object changed attitudes from behind to in-front-of the other orb in the flight, though the latter never cha! nged speed or direction.The rest of the dozen orbs before 4:21pm were regular in their appearance every couple of minutes; appearing in the same part of the sky to the East by North East, stable in their aspect of bright orb without physical form, straight travel paths, 15 seconds in view in a 45&#730; field of view of the sky, at presumedly high altitudes.At 4:21pm, the last of the orbs that I saw in this report was the orb that passed directly overhead. It, unlike the others, seemed to strobe in light intensity over a cycle of a few seconds. Perhaps growing bright then dim in 3 or 4 seconds. I was careful to consider whether I thought it was the orb passing within cloud layers, a light (totally unlike an aircraft's multiple lights and colors), or the glow of the haze-covered sun reflecting off of a tumbling object. I felt that an oscillating light was the best impression.Other Observations in the Area, and Thoughts on Speed  During this half hour that I stood in my back yard and made the sighting observations, I also decided to note as much as I could about the normal everyday sky and its more mundane occupants. Many air corridors exist over Santa Cruz, and I spotted jetliners and cargo jets flying several times. I used one jet as the object to focus my binoculars on, at around 4:10pm, and another that was invisible to the naked eye, but which left a long set of contrails that indicated it was there.My observations were:  if the orbs were flying at the altitude of the highest of the jets, they were traveling in excess of the speed of sound, perhaps more. Whatever the speed of the highest jets leaving contrails, the orbs were many times faster than that.The lowest flight corridor of jets, flying north to San Jose airport, made the distance in the orbs' field of view in about the same amount of time as the orbs. If the orbs were at this altitude, (pretty low as jets fly considering it's an approach run to an airport, though 30 miles out), then they would be going at least several hundred miles per hour, but would have been vehicles without visible wings, no more than 10 feet across, and glowing white.Stars, no.Birds, I considered. Could the sun, however diffused from the hazy western clouds, have lit up the white bodies of Southerly migrating birds? I've seen many a bird here, and at the distance at which a bird's wings or head would be blurred out by its glowing body, I imagine these birds would have been traveling in speeds in excess of a hundred miles per hour, while interacting with clouds that seem to be  high altitude sorts, and in two cases performing abrupt acceleration and deceleration.Satellites, for some of the same reason as birds, seems unlikely to me.Balloons, while arguably traveling in the direction of the wind, would be hard pressed to have one of their number twice in the sighting change position rapidly and then regain its original speed. And certainly the orb I saw above me was an actual light of some sort, and given its integration with the cloud layer, would have constituted a balloon drifting at many hundreds of miles an hour.Final Thoughts   It is my opinion, from what I know of conventional aircraft and my hometown's air corridors, and the size and speed of jets flying at various altitudes, that these orbs were not conventional craft. I do not think they were birds, and they weren't satellites to the best of my understanding of how satellites work.  One had a physical form, though obscured with a bright light in the center.  Another strobed in what looked to be an artificial manner.  They all flew in a solid, smooth path, save the two that performed rapid formation changes.  All but one seemed to appear out of the same stretch of sky, without having first traversed the path of sky to get to that point.  They all moved in the same direction, along the same corridor (save for the one I saw directly above me), and they appeared at regular intervals.  I have seen images and video in the past that approximated what I saw today, and I'm placing this report here to help others make some sense of what they too might have seen.",Duration:21 minutes,"Location: Santa Cruz, CA",Occurred : 12/3/2016 16:00  (Entered as : 12/03/16 16:00),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 12/3/2016 11:19:15 PM 23:19,Shape: Light

1543,"11/29/2016, Fairfield, CA, large floating object moving west to east, early eveningFairfield is the home to Travis Air Force Base.  Around 7 pm on 11/29/2016, I saw a large airplane making a steep banked turn.  A few minutes later I saw what I thought was a smaller plane doing the same, only less banked.  What struck me as unusual was the steep angle of the banking and the low position to the ground.Approximately an hour later, I’m standing outside in Fairfield, CA, having a smoke when I saw what I thought was a boomerang-shaped flock of white birds flying east over Suisun Bay.  As they moved east, over Fairfield, it looked more like a giant scarf floating on the wind.  As I discounted the scarf theory, and wondered what it could be, it looked more like a giant dark bird flying in a V shape.  Only the size was too big to be any bird.  Some stars were visible and I could make out the ‘wing’ eclipse one of the stars.  As it traveled east, it blended into the dark sky.There were no lights or sounds coming from that direction, and the breeze was minimal.  I watched it glide by for over a minute.  At times it reminded me of a 30-foot piece of fabric floating in the air.  As it passed by (at a 40 degree angle from where I was standing), it was larger, darker, and more v-shaped … if it was closer I would have guessed it was a bird gliding by with wings in a ‘v’ shape.  But it was LARGE, and quiet.  There were no airplane noises or anything.  It continued east until I couldn’t see it for the darkness of the sky.  It did not appear to head towards Travis AFB to the south, but rather towards Vacaville to the east.Surely someone else saw it.

Witness 2 is a bird-watcher and says there is nothing like that in nature (not to mention our nature is pretty limited in this town).  If I could compare the noise to anything it would be a zipline made of electricity.  There were two of the same noises, each which lasted about half a second yet created a distinct Doppler effect.  When me and my friend slowly went outside to see what the hell was going on there were birds flying from the direction of the noise (in a dead, snowy night) we could tell that the noises were almost communicating with each other.

It was also shimmering blue, purple, green, and red around the edges.  The flight pattern was like nothing I've ever seen...it was not human.  It slowly hovered and swayed in the same spot for about 20 minutes when the object split into a smaller flashing red light that shot off into the sky. So fast.  I've never seen anything like it.

The objects hovered around each other for a few moments then the little one just...shot off.  Straight out and into space.

What happened was that my dog noticed and went to sniff this dull cream colored sphere that looked like a deflated balloon sitting on the mulch near my front door.  My dog took one sniff and left it alone.  It was about 5""-6"" diameter and some crazy reason I had to go and reach out to it.  As soon as I was about to touch it, it changed to look like a white opalescent glass globe, kind you see on top of the decorative neighborhood light posts (like in my neighborhood), but half the size.  I put my hand on it and it felt just like glass.  I tried to move it as it was obviously in wrong place but I was unable to shift it.  It was like welded to the ground.  I was thinking how peculiar place they have put the light as there was nothing pretty about the mulch.  The lights were not on yet on the street lights.About an hour later I took my dog out again and the sphere was gone.  Not only was it gone but there was nothing showing on the mulch or the ground that the sphere had been there.

The neighbor’s dog was ballistic.  The UFO hurtled back and forth between the two yards, about the size of a trash can lid, and struck the dog on the side.  Saucer also grazed my girlfriend and her brother. We had all had a drink, but we were all sober enough to know what we saw.  The craft had an undistinguishable colour and the lighting was poor, however, we were able to see strange black characters inscribed on the (presumed) hull of the UFO.  The craft landed and took off several times throughout our observation of the events.  Later, some scorch marks were found in the lawn.  The object did not have lights of its own; however, it did emit an aquamarine glow, making it more difficult to see the colour of the UFO’s body.  No life forms were seen.  Possibly an alien drone?  A government drone?  As for observer backgrounds, my girlfriend is studying finance and accounting at a university near our apartment, but we observed the object at her parents’ house in Zebulon.  Her father is an employee at the pharmaceutical company in the town, and her brother was also visiting from college.

1615,"Multiple bright orange lights near Monrovia, MD.On Thanksgiving night (11-24-2016) around 5:45 pm with a house full of family, I stepped out onto my carport for a smoke.  Looking NW towards Urbana/Frederick area, I saw 2 bright orange lights side by side & low on the horizon.  They were coming straight towards my location in Monrovia, MD, at a steady pace and stopped and hovered for about a minute maybe 1 mile from my house.  I estimate their altitude to be around 1000 feet.  Then the first light ascended straight up at a silent but steady pace - the orange light turned white & looked like a distant star, and then it was gone.  Then the second light did the same thing.  I watched for a few more minutes when I noticed 2 more orange lights low on the horizon coming towards me.  One light was faster than the other and it seemed to slow down 2 or 3 times to let the slower light catch up.  These 2 lights stopped and hovered in the same place as the first 2 and then ascend straight up one at a time just like t! he first 2.I watched for a few more minutes and saw nothing more and went inside.  After about 5 minutes, I told my wife about my ""weird"" sighting.  My oldest son overheard my story, and as kids do, wanted to say that I was crazy, so he went outside onto our back deck.  As soon as he got outside, he screamed for everybody to come here now......  Six of us went out onto the deck and we all saw that there were now 7 bright orange lights evenly spaced in a vertical zig-zag pattern at the same spot where the previous 4 lights had ascended straight up.  One by one, all 7 lights ascended straight up until out of sight.This was really weird and the first time I had ever seen anything like this - but there were 6 witnesses to this event.  I doubt if many people saw this because it was dinnertime on Thanksgiving night and the Redskins were playing the Cowboys on TV at this time.  The total event lasted about 25 minutes - it was over around 6:10 pm.As an interesting side note, I offer this.  During this timeframe, I saw no airplanes in the vicinity this entire time.  I live within about 50 miles of 3 major airports (Reagan National, Dulles and BWI) as well as several smaller airports such as Frederick Municipal , Hagerstown, Martinsburg and Montgomery Airpark) - there always seems to be planes in the airspace above us at all different altitudes - except for this night and time.  Within 5 minutes of the last orange light disappearing, there were planes again.We tried to take pictures, but nothing was clear.  However, there is a You Tube video titled ""Family of UFO's Flying over Baltimore"" recorded on 1-31-2016 that shows identical orange lights to what the six of us witnessed.

1618,"Mysterious Red-blinking Lights Appear and Disappear, After Hovering Stationary Over Busy Shopping District in Biloxi, MS.At around 10 minutes past midnight on 11/24/16, I left Diberville, MS Wal-Mart and was in the process of loading my groceries into my car, when one of the shopping cart retrievers said loudly:  ""Will you look at that?  What is that?""  I immediately looked his way, which was to the north of the parking lot, and along with five other Wal-Mart employees (and maybe dozens of others we couldn't see in the area) were staring at what was at first glance, two stationary (hovering in-place) red, blinking lights.  Almost instantaneously, two others popped out of what appeared to be nowhere, in equidistant proximity to the first two.What was instantly apparent to me was the nature of the sighting, these lights weren't an airplane or any known aircraft that I could identify due to the nature of the lights.  They were silent, no apparent noise, they were stationary, as they didn't have a specific trajectory or path in any direction.  Also, the fact that they seemed to be blinking in unison and were hovering silently discounted the possibility of being any known aircraft.  We have an air-force base close by (Keesler AFB in Biloxi, ~ 6 miles from the sighting) from which land and take-off many C130 Air Force planes (Keesler is a home of the Hurricane Hunters).  Now, I've seen many a C130 land and take off at night, and the sighting pattern of what we seen last night was as different from a C130's profile as different could be.Then, almost as suddenly as these lights appeared, in twos, they disappeared completely from sight, in twos (there were four visible to us).  The whole incident lasted maybe 40 seconds to 1 minute.  Within 10 second of the UFO lights disappearing, the car alarms on four cars in the parking lot began to chime in unison, as if some kind of invisible beam and/or electromagnetic wave pulse triggered them.

1621,"Massive green rotating disc-shaped lights over Portland.Looking eastward over the lake/reservoir at Progress Ridge near the Beaverton/Tigard border, two male adult friends and I observed in the distance three radio towers situated in the West Hills that separate downtown Portland from its Western suburbs.  It is important to note that the cloud cover was low, but not low enough to obscure any portion of the radio towers in the distance.  I'll take this opportunity to say I don't believe what we saw was fireworks exploding within the clouds.In the clouds that appeared to be over the West hills and said radio towers we observed first a massive green light that rotated counter-clockwise.  It was orientated as though it was parallel to the ground, and made perhaps only a 90 degree rotation until it disappeared but was replaced (within one second or so) by the exact same shape, only this time in an incredibly quick burst of yellow, then orange, then red colors acting in the same manner.Some 20 seconds later, the exact same reen shape and light occurred again, rotating in the same direction and for roughly the same short amount of time, perhaps a few tenths of a second shorter. Next, only the yellow-colored shape appeared, not the red nor the orange.The object certainly appeared to be concealed precisely within the clouds that were illuminated by the city lights of downtown Portland, but they were absolutely distinct from those city lights.It reminded me of the handheld game ""Simon Says"" the way the colors changed from one to another, and the nature of the colors was reminiscent of the the taillight of a car, as if there was a membrane containing an inner light-producing object.There were also a larger number of aircrafts in that apparent area of the sky just before the lights occurred. Perhaps this could be explained by the vicinity of PDX airport, but the aircraft seemed to remain in the affected area for a far longer time than one would expect of any aircraft approaching the airport.  They also seemed to be physically closer to one another than is seemingly typical for civilian aircrafts.  I am no expert in aviation by any means, but it seemed as if they were flying in formation, sort of like you'd see whenever those F16 (or various fighter jets) fly overhead every so often (they didn't sound like fighter jets, I might add.)  The object appeared to be massive, but seemed to be deliberately concealed by the cloud cover of the late evening.Finally, I believe it is important to note that my two friends and I instantaneously grabbed one another by the sleeves of our jackets and stepped backwards, and all of us admitted to immediately feeling a sense of fear and dread, like you sometimes experience when in the woods and you feel like an animal or another person is nearby but you can't see them.  (I don't say this for dramatic effect, and I don't want to appear sensationalist, I just think it's important to note the immediate sensory reactions we experienced when we saw these lights.)

1626,"Nov 22/2016:  Colourful Ball of Light Over Lake Ontario, CanadaI am a 55 y/o male, single, and live by myself in the East suburbs near Toronto, Canada.This is important to this event, as it means I was in my home alone, with no one to catch a missing time event.  Although I completely believe in aliens and UFO's, I have never seen one before.  My background is in both Accounting and Computer Technology.On the night of Nov 22nd, 2016, I had my AM radio set to listen to Coast2Coast at 9pm as I often do.However, that night's repeat program of the previous night was about The US Dollar and such, and the topic did not interest me.  I turned off the radio and set it aside.I browsed the Internet for a short period of less than 1/2 hour or so, and decided to go to bed. Glancing at the clock, I remember it to be approx 9:30pm.  Maybe 9:25pm Closing the living room blinds, I noticed 2 aircraft outside in the sky.  That is common, as there is a nearby airport.  However, both craft were stationary, and I could not hear any sound of helicopters.  The bodies of the crafts were not visible, just a single dim yellow light, and a stronger red light that was flashing.  I assumed them to be standard hovering helicopters, with an aviation beacon on the bottom.If you held a ruler up against the window, the craft would have been about 10"" apart, which was close enough that I could see both together. I thought it strange that two craft were allowed to fly so close to each other.I glanced to the right (South / East ) over Lake Ontario, and saw a very bright and large star. However, the star was fiercely shimmering/twinkling, and was larger than any star I've seen. It was round, and seemed to be spinning.  Every colour was flashing in split seconds. Red/Green/Blue/White/Yellow.Like as diamond - flashing rainbow colours of light.  But clearly spinning.   My eyes went back and forth between the 2 stationary crafts and the ""star"" and I blurted out ""They're watching it too!!""  At this point, I became excited at the thought it may be a UFO, as I have never seen one before. I grabbed a pair of binoculars from a cabinet next to me, and tried to view the ""star"" through the window but it was not clear.  The binoculars are inexpensive 7x35 magnification.Next to the window, is a door to my patio. Standing in the doorway, I looked directly South / East over Lake Ontario at the ""star"", looking at it with bare eyes, watching it spin with fantastic split-second colours. I held up the binoculars, and tried to focus more, but the focus was almost at the 'infinity' setting of the focus ring,  and no fine adjustment could improve the view. However, the binoculars did allow me to see the same round shape, clearly spinning, showing amazing colours. But no further definition of the object.  I said out loud, ""We see you. We're watching you, whatever you are."" Jokingly expecting it to respond by zooming away. It did not.It was far too large to be a star. I became very excited and scrambled to put on shoes and coat and grabbed my cell phone to take a picture. I ran outside. The sky was jet black, and I could see the 'star' clearly. Also, I looked to my left (North) and vertically upward and could see lights of the 2 craft hovering in the same position above me.Still only could see each as a dim yellow light, with a red flashing beacon light next to it.I was not interested in them, and did not pay much attention to any of their specs.I turned my attention back to the spinning 'star'. I was clearly spinning and showing fantastic lights.Binoculars confirmed the object to be round, spinning , and multi coloured. No further definition.I was panicking at what to do next. I did not want to lose the moment.I held my cell phone up at arm's length to the 'star' and it only appeared as a tiny white dot in the screen.At arm's length, I could see both the tiny picture dot on the screen and the actual 'star' in the distance, just above the phone.I knew that would show nothing in a photo.  I decided to try the movie application, thinking that it may better show the fantastic light show, rather than a still picture dot.  I brought my cell phone close to me and pressed the buttons to start the movie mode, and stretched my arms out again with the cell phone at arm's length trying to find the white dot ( the spinning star) again.  The dot was nowhere to be found on the screen, so I looked at the actual sky, and the 'star' was now just a teeny tiny dot in the dark sky.The same size as a star would expected to be. Far off in the distance out over Lake Ontario.This actual star in the night sky did not register on my camera screen at all now. It was too small.The spinning 'star' had gone. I looked back toward the 2 craft and saw only dark night sky. They were also gone.Higher in the sky over Lake Ontario was the constellation Orion. Because the night sky was so dark and clear, I could see all the stars, especially the 3 of the belt.  Following the belt downward, I could see Sirius. It was certainly not the spinning colourful object I had been watching. My cell phone has Stellarium on it. I opened the app and held my phone up to confirm Orion and Sirius, but I already knew them.I stood there in disbelief. I was angry. I was emotionally upset and frustrated. I had lost my chance to record the spinning object.I had been rushing in a frantic state trying to capture something I knew could end at any time. And I did not succeed.This whole event from first seeing them outside the other window to re-entering my home, lasted only about 10 minutes.It was fast and furious.  And now I was emotionally upset.Turned back to the door, I went inside and went on the Internet on a computer within steps of the door.  I Google'd Orion and Sirius and confirmed the stars I now saw were those I already knew.  But what happened to the larger spinning ball?  I walked over the doorway again, and stared up at the night sky, hoping it would happen again. But nothing.Dejected, I turned around and walked back inside. The clock on the cabinet showed  12:30am  WHAT??  I had just went to close the blinds at 9:30pm !!  Where did 3 hours go ??!!! As stated, the above activity was in a frantic state to try and not miss the event. It was in no way near a 3 hour event.I tried to pad the events' time by judging maybe I spent more time on Google searching Orion / Sirius. Even if I did that for 1/2 an hour ( which I believe to be grossly incorrect) and if I stood on the patio for 1/2 hour in frustration, I'm still missing a couple of hours of time.I was tired, angry, frantic.  I didn't know what do next. I paced around my home for 3 hours trying to calm down.Finally I gave up around 4am, and went to bed.  I don't know why this event made me so frantic and upset.It is now 4 days later, and I can't get it out of my system.

1634,"Large, bright claw-shaped object encountered below cloud cover with noticeable effect on electromagnetic spectrum.At 4:17 on 11/22/2016 on Route 111 in Atkinson, New Hampshire, below a cloud cover, hovered an unknown, potentially hazardous object. The object, initially appearing to be a star or planet, emitted a strong white light.  It would have been impossible to determine this object as a star or planet as the sun was in full shine and the object was against the backdrop of the cloud cover.	While first being obscured by the powerful luminescence it emanated, a witness travelled on the road, growing closer to the object.  To the witness, this craft was nearly indistinguishable from the altitude of approximately 3,300 feet above sea level. However, what appeared to be a metallic object with the shape of  4 claw-like arms emitting a white light became apparent as the witness drew closer.  Approximately 5 minutes after the initial sighting, the craft accelerated at an extraordinarily fast speed directly up into the cloud cover.	The witness’s motor vehicle was temporarily incapacitated by what appeared to be the movement of the craft.  Lights, heating systems, and windows ceased function for 11 seconds.  There was no apparent stalling of the engine.	15 minutes later, near the junction of South Road, Brentwood, and Exeter Road, Exeter, the object reappeared to the same witness, this time in much closer vicinity, approximately 1,000 feet above the ground.  The shape of the object was not of human design that we know of. Four appendages, each extending from a single circular base, formed a claw shape, with each “claw” pointing downwards at the surface.The object was a silvery-black metallic color, and pulsed several times with white lights.  At this point, malfunctions in most systems of the car began to occur.  Heating was cut, electricity went dead, and the engine stalled as the car pulled to a stop.  At this time, there was nobody else on the road.The witness noticed a strange, constant howling noise coming from the craft, almost like an animal scream combined with the running of a jet engine.  The object or craft hung over the road for several more seconds, before shooting up into the sky with what sounded like a sonic boom, or a similar explosion sound.  Directly after the object disappeared, the car’s systems rebooted and the witness continued on his way home.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Atkinson/Kingston, NH",Occurred : 11/22/2016 16:17  (Entered as : 11/22/16 16:17),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/22/2016 6:01:55 PM 18:01,Shape: Other

1642,"I awoke to an event alert from my Nest camera during a time that I was asleep on the night of 11/21/2016.  When I reviewed the footage, I saw what appeared to be lights outside that lit up and cast shadows on my front door’s window in an unusual way.The door that the lights appeared through is on the second floor facing the North, towards a street in Key Colony Beach, Florida, that has a speed limit of 25 MPH (West Ocean Drive) directly across from a restaurant named the Key Colony Inn, with four palm trees in close proximity (within 20 feet) of it.Anyway, I showed the footage to a few of my colleagues at work.  The most viable explanation that any of them provided was a search light from a helicopter.  We have had a lot of Cubans making landfall, via water on crude rafts, in an attempt to establish citizenship in the USA recently, so, it made sense, and I dismissed it as such.However, after work, I reviewed the footage on the larger screen of my computer, turned up the volume, and then slowed it down to see frame-by-frame detail.  Upon doing so, it appeared to me as though it was unlikely this was from a helicopter.  For one, there was no audible noise, other than a low continuous white noise from a box fan, that was set to low, on the other side of the kitchen wall in the foreground of the video.  Second of all, there seemed to be four light source locations in the three seconds or so that it lasted, and those lights did not seem to sweep from side to side; rather, they seemed to be moving, primarily from right to left (East to West) based on how the shadows of the palm trees and railing outside were cast on the window of the door.  Not to mention the lights did not seem to be originating from high enough to support the helicopter theory.I have also tried to dismiss this as electricity arcing from the power lines to palm trees that are in the general direction of the light sources in the video (about 100 feet from the door), as they are very close to the power lines; however, I would think that an arc this bright should make a noise.  Please correct me if I am wrong.The first light source, based on the height of the railing in relation to the shadow that was cast on the door, as well as the palm frond that is most likely casting a shadow on the door, seems to have originated from the parking lot of the condominium complex to the West of the one that I live in, or slightly closer, but in line with that parking lot.  It also looks as though there was two light sources, one dimmer and slightly lower than the other, as the top of the concrete railing, that is outside the door, has a double shadow.The second and third light sources seen seem to be traveling primarily from East to West, very rapidly at one point, based on the sudden change of the railing shadow position from one frame to the next, yet it is a bit more confusing, as far as source position and direction of travel; however, I believe it is actually two light sources that come close together, as it is nearly void of a palm tree shadow after a few frames, and at that time it is casting an overlapping shadow of the diamond shapes present in the concrete railing.The fourth light source is only visible for about four frames (two frames of bright light); however, the light source seems to be a little more visible in the window.I am not an expert at assessing light sources by examining shadows.  However, it would appear as though all of the lights came from the same area, and not very far from my apartment, as I took photographs from outside to see where a source would need to be to cast shadows from the various palm trees on the window of the door.I’ll be emailing the video clip, as well as the photographs of the area outside the door, to include a photo that shows the view seen from inside the door, looking out, as well as a snip from Google Earth that shows the location of my apartment with a blue dot.I’ve been scratching my head for a couple of days now, and decided to reach out to the experts to help try to make sense of this event.Thank you for any input you can provide about this matter.",Duration:4 seconds,"Location: Key Colony Beach, FL",Occurred : 11/21/2016 23:35  (Entered as : 11/21/2016 23:35),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/24/2016 3:52:35 PM 15:52,Shape: Light

Most of the time due to glare and using a Samsung S6 phone I usually couldn’t view my pictures that well until after I came back into the condo.  On this particularly clear morning I came back in and later in the day checked the pictures I had taken that day.  At first I thought I had taken picture of the moon as well as the sun.

Again, I did not see this during taking them nor was focusing on it.  The sun is so bright coming up that you probably couldn’t have seen anything else in the sky but the sun at this point anyway.I always take a series of pictures to make sure I get at least a couple good ones that I can put on my computer for a screen saver.  I have 8 pictures where this object appears.  Even moving into the sand dunes very close to where I was standing.  If you enlarge the closest 1 of those, you can almost see a head like object with what appears to be 2 eyes in this small slice of an object that appears right over the sphere.In no other pictures I took throughout my entire vacation did this object appear in any picture so it wasn’t something on my phone camera lense.",Duration:15 minutes,"Location: Miramar Beach, FL",Occurred : 11/21/2016 06:00  (Entered as : 11/21/2016 6:00),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/30/2016 7:54:47 AM 07:54,Shape: Sphere
1650,"I observed red-orange orb lights floating on my back lanai at 3:30 am.I was awakened around 3:30 am and I was lying in my bed wondering why I had woke up.   Then something outside on my back lanai caught my eye.  My louver windows were closed but I saw a reddish-orange floating light outside the window.  It was about 5 ft. in the air.  Then 2-3 more of the same kind of lights appeared, making the total number of lights outside the window to being 4.  They seemed to be interested in the string of pinkish- red colored lights that I had on my lanai that were on at the time.  Then one of the lights left the others and flew close to my bathroom window that is located towards the back of the lanai behind the washer and dryer.  When the light came close to the bathroom window, which was also closed it illuminated the bathroom with a reddish -orange light.  It then floated back to join the other lights that were still floating in the air.  They remained there for awhile, about 15-20 minutes.  Then they just disappeared.  I was frozen sitting in my bed.

1679,"Rectangular prism hanging over Minneapolis vanishes after 1 minute durationI saw a similar object as the other reporter for this date, but my view was much closer, so I really got a good look at it.  It was early afternoon and I was driving in Minneapolis.  The object was in a northerly direction.  I saw a very large rectangular prism just hanging there in the sky.  It was just beyond the tree line, the tree line about 4 city blocks away.  It looked like it was hanging over the city's lakes area.  It was off-white in color with brown outlining the edges and outlining other rectangular shapes within the object outline.  Interesting detail, the off-white was dirty and dingy, like it was old and well used.  It didn't move, it just hung in the air.  It was close to the ground too.  Usually, when I think of UFO's, I imagine them like the movies; high in the sky, flashing some lights, flying around, then speeding by, and disappearing.It did disappear, but not by speeding away.  It just vanished, it was there one second and gone the next.I discounted what I saw, I don't know why.  I don't want to be a conspiracy person maybe, sorry no offense intended.

My wife called me to the bedroom and states that a bright light is shining through our window.  I look and it's like a helicopter spot light is aiming directly at the house, but it is naking zero noise. I went outside to inspect and it's just a hovering light like a bright white mini silent sun.  Each time it slowly fades and then disappears.  It is definitely within range to hear if it was a plane or helicopter.  No flashing lights.  Just a solid light.  I attempted to examine it through my tifle scope, but it was too bright to determine what it is.  Following its disappearance what seems to favor a fox bark has occurred each time.  That part could be a coincidence, but a rather strange one if you ask me.  We can't be the only ppl seeing this.

In the time I grabbed my binoculars (maybe 15-20 seconds)  and turned back both “stars” brightness began to dim substantially as if on a dimmer switch.  The rest of the stars in the sky stayed at normal intensity so it was not a passing cloud.All of a sudden, these “ stars” began to move very slowly and I saw through the binoculars each “star” was at the end of a very long dark cylindrical object.  The soundless object slowly moved towards the west/southwest and out of view from my window.  I ran outside and  couldn't find it but there were pine trees and mountain blocking the western part of the sky the where object was headed.

1690,"Ball of Bluish white light entering home.  Flashes of light and missing time.On Friday, November 18, 2016, we had another family encounter.Unfortunately it was during a snow storm so little detail about the craft was perceived.The winds were easily over 80 km/hr.  Visibility was zero due to snow and sleet, during wind gusts  We live out in the country side, about 10 minutes outside of Thunder Bay.  Earlier in the day at around 3 pm we went to town to pick up our kids from school.  The weather was horrible already, but we had to go to grab the kids.Carefully we drove and navigated the ice covered streets, picked up the kids, stopped for an early dinner and decided to hit up a walmart to grab a few things before heading back home.It's about 7pm at this time.  The weather seemed much worse.  The roads in the city were slippery, but still navigable.As soon as we got onto the country road, it was apparent that this storm was hitting us full force. It was pitch black out asides from my cars headlights.It was stupid to be outside in this storm, so I drove very slow with my hazards on.  At times we had to stop dead in road due to total white outs.About 1 km up the road we noticed that no houses had any lights on.That's a tell tale sign there isn't going to be power at our house.We went around a corner and in the middle of the road is tree bits everywhere and to the immediate right is a tree on the power lines.After about 30 minutes, we made the usual 10 minute drive home.  Sure enough no lights on.I pointed the car towards the house and instructed the family to each grab a bag and bring it to the house.We have been using the back door due to reno's in the front.So the wife and kids made their way to the back of the house with the aid of my high-beams in the drive way.Once they were in, my wife flashed the cell phone through the bay window in the front, signaling they are in.I turned off the car and made my way to the house.  Tree branches were breaking due to the high winds. As mentioned it was pitch black outside - I pressed the remote car lock on and off so the car lights would flash, providing some illumination, while I made my way through the snow drifts and into the house.Once inside, it was apparent the hydro had been out for awhile. It was about 15 degrees Celsius in the house.Thankfully we have a wood stove also.We had the kids sit on the couch with a flash light.  The wife lit a few candles in the living room and grabbed the dog to bring him outside for a pee, and I grabbed the wood bucket to go to the shed to get a fire started in the woodstove.I used the cell phone flash light app to find my way to the wood shed, the wife stood in the middle of the back yard with the dog while he did his thing.As im in the shed grabbing wood and filling the bucket I faintly hear my wife scream over the howling wind "" WTF ""  At first I thought she was yelling because she fell over or something, then she screamed my name.I came out of the shed and she started screaming ""Did you see that, did you effin see that""  I had no idea what she was talking about, I started making my way over to her.  The snow blew so hard that I lost visibility of her for a brief moment and I dropped the cell phone in the snow. I took the 10 steps to get to her and she was screaming, ""The sky just lit up blue above the house, the ground, everything turned blue then white.""  I looked to the back window of the house and the kids were screaming.  Smacking on the sliding glass door.  We ran into the house.The kids were crying and screaming ""what was that, what happened""  They were freaking out.My oldest -12 years old,  said something was outside our front bay window, and everything in the house turned blue then white.I was dumbfounded, I didnt know what to think because I didnt see anything.My wife and kids were Both crying. I felt so confused as to what happened. My head was pounding, and everyone else was extremely emotional.Then while we were all standing by the back sliding glass door, the only way i can explain it, it was like a light came through the window and instantly flashed from red to a bluish green than disappeared.I was more confused than anything and said WTF just happened I said out loud. It felt dream like.My 12 and 8 year old were crying and screaming ""I want to go""  my wife was flipping out, panicking and I just stood there. Because I felt like it was all just a dream.I started asking my wife what did the blue light look like outside, and asked her to describe it.I said Could it have been someone with a flare, or a roman candle, ect.My wife yelled at me, "" I dont know what it was, but the first thing I thought was a UFO and that it was the end of the world.""  The end of the world I repeated?  She said yes, as soon as I seen the light I felt complete dread.She looked completely terrified.I tried calming everyone down and said it must have been lightening, or something caused by the storm.  (I personally have never seen lightening in a snow storm, but I know it can happen.)Then I said it must have been a electrical transformer blowing up.I asked my 12 year old, what exactly did you see.She was crying and holding on to me saying a bright blue light was at the window, it came into the house, turned blue then white.  Then the candle flames got really big and the cats freaked out.Just as she said it, the room went bright from another window on the opposite side of the house.  We all turned towards the window, but it was gone.Again every one started crying and yelling. I tried to calm them all and said to sit on the couch, ill get a fire going quick.My wife stood in front of the big bay window, watching to see if it happened again.I think about 10 minutes went by. The fire was going, then my wife said,  There it is look! It's  out over the trees. I looked out the window and there it was.  A bluish white ball of light. Hovering Above the trees, across the road.  Probably 450-500 meters away from the house.It just stayed stationary there while all of us looked at it.  It looked about the size of a quarter in my fingers, if I were to hold it up at arms length and on the closer side to 500 meters away.I dont know how long we stood there watching, but it was almost a hypnotic feeling.  We all stood there staring.suddenly i snapped out of it and looked around.My living room was filled with smoke and the wife and kids were still looking out the window.I panicked and yelled for everyone to get to the back of the house.  I was very confused now, I looked at my watch and it was now 9:30 pm.  It was 35 minutes since I started the fire and started watching out the window.The wife and kids for the first time this night, calmly turned around and went to the back door. I opened the wood stove door and messed around with the fire and told the wife to crack the back door to let the smoke out.During this, I looked out the window and the light was not there.I had everything under control after about 5 minutes with the door open, the smoke was cleared.We all sat back on the couch, trying to get warm.The laptop had juice in it so I put on a movie to watch while we waited for the hydro to come back on.After calling the hydro company they told us that it wouldn't be restored till 6pm tomorrow due to the storm. We all huddled together in the living room on the couch in front of the wood stove for the rest of the night.The kids didn't mention the event once until they fell asleep.The remainder of the night was uneventful.The next day while the hydro crews working on the power down the road, I pulled over to talk to them.  I asked one of the techs if any transformers blew in the area around my house.They said no.  A tree downed the main power line 10 minutes from my house.The same tree that we noticed was on the road as we drove home the night before, after the power had already gone out.Things of note: no drone nor helicopter could have operated in these conditions…  I know because I have my private pilots license.Winds were above 80km p/h, trees were coming down all over the place.  Total white out conditions at times.This is just one experience that I have had. I have had many of the same nature.My grandmother and My mother have had these experiences.I have had them all my life, and now my youngest daughter - 8 years old -is mentioning things to me about things she is experiencing.",Duration:3:00,"Location: Thunder Bay (Canada), ON",Occurred : 11/18/2016 19:30  (Entered as : 11/18/16 19:30),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 3/5/2017 5:04:01 PM 17:04,Shape: Light

1704,"Four bluish-white lights (possibly saucers) + one upside-down teardrop ship over i93 and own home, Methuen, MA, 01844I was coming down the highway (specifically i93 North) and right near exit 46-47, I noticed a few lights in the sky, towards the southwest, much closer to earth compared to the surrounding stars, (I verified this later on, viewing the lights through my binoculars from my kitchen window) and I knew something was different because the stars were so dim, and these lights were so bright, and one of these lights even had a diamond shape to it, with a vertical light coming down from the main point of horizontal light on the top.  (the best description I have for this shape are those concept photos of what cloud cities would look like on Venus)  I felt a drop in my stomach because at first, I honestly thought it was an incoming meteor and even swerved my car out of shock from these lights.  They were clearly spinning and blinking blue and white lights, and the other few objects, other than the cloud city-looking one, almost had a saucer shape to them when I looked through binoculars when I arrived home.  (which these lights were totally visible the entire night, from the highway and then from my home in Methuen as well) I grabbed my iPhone and started recording when I got home, and when I was watching the video I took from my street, you can't see much, but you can tell that although the lights were stationary, they were clearly moving and hovering, and you can even see the succession of colors it was giving off.  Now at first, I thought these may have been drones, but I witnessed them stay aligned in a swooping line under the moon and continue to blink and hover in the same exact position until 3:30am the following morning! I had my father verify that these lights were indeed there and that I was not crazy for thinking there were strange lights locked in with the moon's path across the night sky. He isn't a believer either, but he was stumped by what we were witnessing, and even took a few looks through the binoculars to make sure they w! ere really there hovering!  What's even more interesting, is that two n ights later, when the clouds broke for a few at night, I could see the possibly saucer-shaped, blue and white flashing light again, in the same exact position, not moving but clearly hovering and spinning!  I have been doing some research, and the only possible report of UFOs that matched my description, were seen traversing in front of the sun and interacting with said star two days before I saw what I saw; they were blue and white orbs and they were witnessed possibly taking energy from our sun, and I am starting to wonder if what I saw was maybe one of these orbs, much smaller, viewing the Earth and keeping a close eye as there mothership interacts with our sun (maybe to prevent the earthlings from acting on this giant object near our sun!) who knows, I just know what I saw and I will try to figure out a way to post the videos I have, zoomed in and more focused on the objects.",Duration:6 hours,"Location: Methuen, MA",Occurred : 11/17/2016 21:30  (Entered as : 11/17/16 21:30),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/20/2016 8:05:11 AM 08:05,Shape: Light

When we decided to take a break to eat from viewing, we sat down and were looking to the North East sky.After about 5 or so minutes, we saw a single bright above average size light in the sky, the light was changing from white, to a reddish, to amber color.  It was a continuous light, but its light source seemed unstable. ( kinda flickering)  As I was looking at this, I said to girl with me, while she was in mid sentence, What is that?  I thinks a UFO.  She started to discredit me, but as soon as she looked at it, she went dead silent and just watched.The one light almost grew and then separated into five separate lights close together and all of the same color and unstable.  These 5 lights stayed in a line the whole time and didn't ascend or descend (they never moved from their position in the sky).After about 30 seconds of this, the lights started to chase each other like Christmas lights do. first it chased forward 3 times and backward 3 times.  Then stopped and then one by one each light when out and never comeback on again.The sky was 100% clear, we both looked at each other and both agreed it was unusual. After the sighting 2 odd things happened... all noise in the area crickets, coyotes, desert frogs (we were near a small river) and anything else stopped making noise and her and I both had a very uneasy feeling set in, almost felt liking being watched.Once that feeling set in, we cut our night short and left to go home.While looking on this website, I noticed several sightings in the phoenix/glendale area and another area south of phoenix with many sightings in the past 3 weeks.  several of those sightings I read seemed similar to my event",Duration:2 minutes,"Location: Benson (north of), AZ",Occurred : 11/16/2016 22:37  (Entered as : 11/16/2016 22:37),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/25/2016 3:51:36 PM 15:51,Shape: Light

I looked with my physical eyes at the moon and saw something darker than the moon and sky in the same area.  I took more photos and each one contained the sphere.  It looked very solid.  I decided to clean the lens and take the case off the phone and use an additional lens that hooks on the back of the iPhone 6 Plus.  I saw the object even clearer at this point.  I zoomed in without losing resolution and took a few more.  I examined those with my partner and he was very intrigued and we zoomed in and were awe struck.  It was a sphere but it was a moon.  It looked exactly like our moon only smaller. In the photos, there is a visible lens flare/glare that is bouncing off of the overhead lot lights.  This sphere/additional moon was not a lens anomaly.  To further debunk the oddity, we walked to the park in the middle of our condos.  We saw the bright big moon through the tree tops. I took out the camera and began shooting more pictures.  We figured if it was a lens or camera issue, it would project this second moon overlapping the tree branches, thus copying the image of the actual moon.

1770,"Commercial passenger plane narrowly avoids collision with mystery object.This sighting was reported from several media outlets in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)  I did not personally witness this event; I am reporting it as it was reported by the several local media outlets.  Following is a report from a large newspaper (The Toronto Star) in the area:  The pilots of a Porter Airlines flight inbound to Toronto on Monday morning were forced to put their plane into a sudden dive to avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified object high over Lake Ontario, causing minor injuries to two flight attendants.Now investigators with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada admit they have a puzzle on their hands to determine exactly what the pilots had to avoid.“Nobody knows at this point. It happened so quick,” said Peter Rowntree, senior regional investigator with the safety board.“We’ve got our work cut out trying to figure out what this unidentified flying object was. What did they encounter?” Rowntree said in an interview.“It definitely wasn’t a bird. It was a fairly large object,” he said, describing it as up to three metres wide.There were initial concerns that the object was an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, highlighting once again worries about their growing prevalence and the risks they pose to aviation.Rowntree said it was too soon to say for sure. But he said the location of the incident — at 2,743 metres (9,000 feet) over the lake near the U.S. border, far from shore — is reason for concern if it was a drone.The Porter Dash 8-400 turboprop was on its initial approach to Toronto’s Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport from Ottawa when the two pilots saw they were on a collision course. They had mere seconds to spot the object and react to avoid the danger.“They essentially just pushed the nose down to get underneath it,” Rowntree said.“It’s a big sky out there, so the fact they even saw it is something,” he said, noting that the aircraft was travelling at almost 450 kilometres per hour.Two flight attendants suffered minor injuries in the evasive manoeuvre. They were taken to hospital and released. None of the 54 passengers on board the flight were injured, airline spokesperson Brad Cicero said.At first the pilots believed the object was a balloon, but later thought it could have been a drone, Cicero said.The Toronto Star published the above article.  I removed information about this being a possible drone and the concerns about people flying drones that wasn't important regarding the sighting description.  The drone they speak of is not a military drone; as Canada doesn't appear to have such craft.  A personal drone (UAV) doesn't usually offer enough range to have been at the altitude - and distance from shore - this object was seen.  Most commercial UAV drones have a range of between 100 metres and 2000 metres.",Duration:several seconds to severa,"Location: Pickering (near) (Canada), ON",Occurred : 11/14/2016 07:30  (Entered as : 11/14/16 07:30),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/15/2016 2:03:52 PM 14:03,Shape: Unknown

I had seen similar objects the day before (November 12 - Bethesda, MD report) and on November 5 (Bethesda, MD report) and October 15 (Kensington, MD - report not filed).  The white object was high in the sky - no clouds were present.  It was moving from right to left (West to East).  Wheaton, Maryland, is about 4 miles directly north of Washington, DC, and the airspace is pretty restricted.  The object veered - or more like pivoted - southward, as if heading toward DC/Virginia.

1790,"Falling Stars and Cloaked SightingsAt 5 a.m. Sunday November 13th 2016   I was looking out my bay window at the bright moonlit morning.  I noticed 3 large brightly lit stars in the eastern sky. They were at the 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock positions with the third star just to the right and down of the 10 o’clock star.  The 10 o’clock star was flashing red, green and blue.  The 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock stars also had an elongated or even an 8 shape to them.  Suddenly the third star shot down at a 45 degree to earth.  It did not have a tail.  It was a perfect bright circle.About 5 minutes later, a fourth bright star from about the 12 o’clock position shot straight down.  These falling stars landed very far away.I continued to watch the skies for about 2 more minutes when I noticed movement on the street in front of my home.  (The street is about 50 feet from my window.)  What I saw is very hard to describe, so here goes...“It” was about 6 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet long and in the shape of a flat and slightly distorted semicircle with no real volume or thickness. “It” was see through and did not have any defining edges. I must add that it did not shine or glisten in any way, but  did have a faint light gray color to it. I was able to see it because of the faint color distorting the corn stalks on the other side of it into a blur as it glided down the street. The speed of the glide was a casual walking pace.Anticipation grew within me as it neared the corner street light. If my eyes were playing a trick on me, the light would surely show what was truly there.  Now I could see what it really was in the light,but just before it got to the light, it disappeared.I continued to watch the skies and the street but nothing new happened until my husband walked into the room a few minutes later.  I told him that something amazing just happened but first to look at the two bright stars in the sky.  He too noticed the flashing colors of the 10 o’clock star.  I was watching the sky at the time but he averted his gaze to the street. He saw something too.  I asked him to describe in full detail what it was in size, shape,color etc. He described exactly what I saw just a few minutes earlier.  His encounter was exactly the same as mine,right down to the way it moved (glided).We agreed that it reminded us of the movie “Predator” with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

One, it was the color of and appeared to be on fire.  Two, I couldn’t discern that it was making any noise.  Three, it moved from that eastern view toward Seattle (a Northerly direction) until it disappeared behind a distant cloudbank.  It appeared to maintain a constant trajectory and speed.

Myself and my children were outside playing in the yard, then abruptly the dogs around the neighborhood started barking and a car driving by had its engine stop without reason, suddenly a loud roaring  was heard by everyone.  It was loud enough that the windows on our home were shaking violently.  I grabbed my children as my first thought was that it was a crashing airplane, or a missile.  We looked up as all of the neighbors on the street exited their homes in fright.  Up high in the sky was a ""very"" large spherical object streaming through the sky at high speeds emitting light grey smoke trailing behind.  The object was metallic in appearance, shortly around 15-20 seconds into the sighting two military jets were seen flying at high speeds toward the object.It was clear at this point that the object was descending very fast towards the Rocky Mountains.  I am very familiar with all types of government aircraft, civilian and astronomical objects.  This was neither.  I'm not normally one to believe in the paranormal or extraterrestrials, but this was undeniable.

The noise rumbled through the house.  I am a private pilot and it did not sound like any normal aircraft.  The weather here was in thick fog so there was no way to see what could have moved so fast and without the sound of jet engines.  I actually though a plane was descending fast and about to crash.  The noise came and went so fast. There was neither an approaching nor a trailing sound.It was definitely above the house.  My house sits about 500' above sea level and my thought was that the craft was far below legal limits.A few minutes later I heard what sounded like military aircraft above the fog seeming to move northward and a couple of minutes later I again heard a military sounding craft streaking above the fog - it is most unusual to have military aircraft except for the Reserve helicopters that sometimes fly in the area out of McNary Field here in Salem, Oregon.

1827,"Extreemly Loud and Long Sonic BoomHello,  I was sitting in my ground level apartment this morning at approximately 11 am when I hear a sonic boom.  I've lived near airports before so I've heard sonic booms before, but this one was unusually loud and long.  It last approximately 13 seconds, and was done so close to the ground that I could feel it though my wheeled chair.  It’s very unusual for us to have sonic booms where I live, although the Salem airport does have military vehicles, and aircraft, it is located almost directly south from my apartment.The boom had an odd characteristic, I don't know if it’s from how close to the ground it was, but there seemed to be a low level rumble that preceded it by a second or two followed by the usual explosion of sound a boom creates.  From how it sounded it was going from south to north, and as I said it took nearly 13 seconds for the boom to begin to fade.  Unfortunately, I wasn't dressed well enough to step outside to see what created the sound, but I can safely say I've never heard a boom happen like that before. I'm lived in the apartment I'm in for 4 years, and lived around airports most of my life.  I lived near the Salem airport for 7 nearing 8 years, PDX the Portland International Airport for 10 years, and 10 years due west of the Hillsboro airport where the Blue Angels flew overhead during the airshow all 10 years I lived there. I’m no military expert, let me say that out front.  I’ve worked in customer service most of my life, but have seen several different military vehicles living near the airports I’ve lived in, and while I couldn’t ID them, I am familiar with the booms they make.  I’ve never heard one quite like what I heard today between the preceding rumble, the odd vibration to the boom, or the feeling of the chair under me vibrating slightly from it. Hope this helps with all future ventures in to investigations.",Duration:13 seconds,"Location: Keizer, OR",Occurred : 11/11/2016 11:00  (Entered as : 11/11/16 11:00),Posted: 11/11/2016,Reported: 11/11/2016 12:00:55 PM 12:00,Shape: Unknown

Turned to purple moved horizontally and quickly vanished.Event location:  Euless Texas (just southwest of DFW Airport)  Weather: Scattered high clouds but clear in the area of the observation  Light:  No external house lights on.  Early evening just after sunset (dark)  Observation:  Looked to northern sky and saw a white object approaching.  At first I thought it was an aircraft but then it stopped moving and held a fixed position.  Seconds later, the object turned to a brilliant red light (no aircraft navigation lights or beacon).Physical location of object from my position:  It was 12 degrees (slightly east of north).  The object was approximately at a 30-45-degree angle upward from my observation area.  The object was west of the DFW airport and not in any known traffic pattern for DFW aircraft (west of approach/departure for runway 18L and 18R)  DFW ATC:  Arrivals from north and departures to south  Observation:  After approximately 30-45 seconds in a stationary position, the object changed color from brilliant red to purple (looked like a LED light).Size of observed sighting: The object was smaller than the moon yet larger than a bright star.   I compare the size to slightly smaller than my smallest fingernail.Observation:  Shortly after the object changed color to purple (approximately 5 seconds), it moved horizontally to the east toward DFW.  The object did not move far (approximately 12 degrees to 20 degrees) and did not get close to DFW air traffic.  Once again it stopped but was somewhat obscured from my view due to trees.Observation:  The object stayed in the obscured location for a very short time (maybe 3 seconds) and then appeared to move upward and north at a fast pace until it was out of sight.Notifications:  Contacted a former college who works with DFW ATC.  Contacted local media KTVT at 7:10PM.  Reported event to UFO Center via telephone.  FYI- media asked for a photo or video (no time to think fast enough to get a camera).  Media stated they could not report on the event without any physical evidence.Total event time: 6:40PM for approximate 1.5 to 2 minutes (was hard to tell how long exactly).My background: 40 years aviation (Operational Control, Emergency Response, Internal Evaluation, Airport Management).   Private pilot and aviation safety consultant.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Yes, I did report it to the media (KTVT TV CBS affiliate DFW) but they said it would not be shared on the news without a photo or video.  I told them that I just wanted the sighting on record in the event others call them with a similar observation.I failed to mention the distance away in my report.  Because of the darkness, it was very difficult to estimate the distance and accurately state the size of the object.Thanks for the good work your team is doing.   Maybe someday we will learnmore about unexplainable sightings such as this.   I can assure you this isan event I will not forget.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be a highly qualified, and credible, witness.

1852,"3 objects moving across the sky, until 1 leaves the group.Shortly after getting home, I saw something odd in the South-West (~230 deg) sky while taking the trash out.  I’m a star gazer.  So I can tell the difference between stars, planets, satellites and so forth.  I saw what looked to be one of the closer planets, but the light was not right.  It kind of looked like multiple lights clustered closely together.  That is what caught my eye initially.While looking at that, I noticed 2 fainter lights (about as bright as a far away star) appeared to be moving relative to the bright light.  Meaning the spacing between the 3 was varying.  The 3 lights were slowly moving from the South-West sky to the North-West.  All the while the 2 fainter lights kept changing their proximity to the bright light.At this point I went inside to grab my binoculars to get a better look. It was obvious their altitude was very high.  I actually thought this might be the International Space Station, but the other 2 lights made that not likely, and they were moving to slow.  While viewing the 3 lights thru the binoculars, one of the 2 fainter lights, started moving straight down at a much faster rate than they were moving across.  I lost sight of it as it moved below the roof line of my house.The other 2 continued on their original path and I lost them in the clouds a minute later.

1865,"Brightly lit triangle craft hovered 50 feet above roadway Spokane, WA.I was driving home on High Drive around 9:30 pm Wednesday Nov. 9, 2016, after having dinner in downtown Spokane when this incident occurred.I was headed east on High Drive and approaching the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard when I saw this giant incredibly bright object in the sky that was immediately above the treetops about four blocks away.At first, I wasn't sure if it was a panel of stadium lights, but there's no stadium anywhere nearby. I live just a short distance from where this incident occurred, and I have been there thousands of times over the past 17 years, and I have never once seen a light like that anywhere in the neighborhood.I drove toward the object, and pulled over on the south side of East 43rd Avenue, between South Scott and South Garfield Streets. What I saw was a giant triangle that was only 50 feet or so above me, and hovering above some trees in a residential neighborhood.The object appeared to be about 180 feet long (half the distance between Scott Street and Garfield Street on 43rd Avenue) and 90 feet wide. There were white lights all the way around the sides of the triangle, and it was hovering in one place and didn't make any noise.Where I pulled over by the side of the road was almost directly underneath this triangle object, and I could see dark black circles on the underside.I turned my engine off, and watched this triangle object. There was absolutely no noise coming from it.Right after I pulled over, the thing started moving slowly from east to west. I reached in my purse to grab my cell phone so that I could take a picture, and I kept looking back at the triangle when suddenly it took off faster than anything ever seen my life. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.When the object took off, it went west. It's speed was so fast that had I blinked my eyes, I would've missed it.The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes (9:30 to 9:40 pm). I know this because I had just looked at my dashboard clock as I approached the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard, and I called my mother immediately afterward to tell her what I had seen.If I was to compare the size of the triangle from my perspective it to the size of a full moon, it was dozens if not hundreds of times bigger.If I was to compare the size of the triangle to my clenched fist held at arm's length, it was much, much larger.Although I was alone in my car, I am absolutely certain that there were other witnesses to this incident.When I reached the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive at 9:30 pm, there were several Spokane Police officers standing in the flowerbeds of a private residence and talking to an older gentleman. They were parked in the driveway of the house on the north side of High Drive. They appeared to be looking for something in the flowerbeds adjacent to the roadway at a private home on the south side of High Drive.While I was parked on 43rd Avenue and watching the triangle, another car (vehicle #2) drove by my car. Vehicle #2 was headed east to west on 43rd Ave. and passed directly under this giant lighted triangle. I am absolutely certain the driver of Vehicle #2 saw the triangle, because it was brighter than any light I have ever seen.When I got home, I went to the Spokane News page on Facebook to see if anyone had posted anything about this. The only thing I found was a post about a car accident that occurred at 6 pm that night at the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive.However, was no sign of any vehicle collision at that intersection at 9:30 pm, so I don't think the  triangle object is related to the car accident earlier that evening.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere.

We live fairly close to the airport in our town and as we were talking we looked and saw what looked to be like two fireballs going through the sky.

It came over us and then the light went out again.  It continued to happen one more time before finally stopping.  The craziest part about all of it is these “crafts” never made a sound.

1894,"Slow moving triangle shaped craft with three red blinking lights in centerI live in rural Walla Walla, Wa.  At about 12:05 AM on 11/08/2016 I was in my kitchen working on the computer. I heard a very loud rumble flying over my house so I went outside to investigate.  A large triangular craft was flying over my property with three red flashing lights underneath in the center.  The lights were arranged in a triangle pattern and blinked on and off together at a pace of about one beat per second.  The edges of the craft were rounded and the points of the triangle were also rounded.  The underside of the craft was contoured and rolled underneath along each side and tapered out to the triangle points in a series of parallel rolls on each end.The blinking red lights appeared to be deeper set in a recess in the center of the craft.  The craft color appeared to be metallic silver.  The craft was lighted around the edges because I could see it so distinctly.The craft flew very slowly from the northwest and flew to the southeast toward the Blue Mountains.  It flew a distance of about 2 miles and was approaching the Blue Mountains when the craft appeared to be stopped in mid air for a short time and then flew on at such a slow speed it was difficult to see movement at a distance.  The blinking lights finally disappeared over the mountains.  The craft was so large that it was still very visible in the distance.The whole event took about 10  minutes.  Unfortunately my camera was in the house and I did not want to leave to go get it.  It was very dark out and no moon.

1896,"Odd light made quick u-turn and hovered.Odd sighting on the night of November 7, 2016.  Time about 2200 local, 0300Z. Viewer location: Bethlehem, GA, about 45 miles NE of Atlanta GA.Observation time: minute or less.Bright, moving light in the NE sky makes short u-turn, erratic motion, then lost from sight.Looking up at the night sky to the NE towards Auriga, I noticed a bright object moving to the Northeast.  We have a tremendous amount of traffic in the North Georgia skies, and I watch it a lot.  First impressions were “Is that the ISS?”, but at that location it may have been in the shadow by then.  It was farther East than I thought I should still be able to see it because of the Earth’s shadow, and I could not be sure whether or not it was blinking, but the light was not steady.  Might have been twinkling if it was far enough away.  The velocity looked just a little fast for the ISS.  There was no separation in the light and any flashing that may have been there, as in Wing lights.  Distance looked to be many miles.Over abut a 10 second period, it slowed down a little and changed course slightly to the East.  Then, in period of 3 to 4 second, made a 180 degree U-turn in the space of 1, not more than 2 finger widths held at arm’s length.  It continued towards the SW, and made 2 or 3 small deviations in path, sped up and slowed down a lot, and came to what looked like a stop. It was too far away and/or too high to be a helicopter I thought, and there was no sound as it appeared to be hovering from my perspective. The brightness was about that of Capella, the bright star in Auriga.  Motion then resumed but slower. I am not sure of the position of the object to the nearby stars at that point.  I called for my wife to come look, and lost track of it for about 10 seconds.  I thought it was there, but when I looked back to where I thought it was, the only thing like it was Capella.This was definitely moving in a very odd pattern for an airplane, and at that distance had to be moving pretty fast.  The quick, tight U-turn and erratic motions were not like a passenger airplane would make.  I think it was too high for a helicopter, and far enough away to not be audible.I continued to watch for several more minutes, but realized it had disappeared or faded out, and the only thing of comparable magnitude was Capella..The strange thing was this was able to do a U-turn very quickly - within 3 seconds I'd guess, and it seemed to make changes in direction without the usual ""curved"" trajectory.  It also stopped moving.  It appeared to be rather far away.

1904,"3 Triangular shaped crafts were seen hovering over the tree tops, under a 1st Phase Moon, then disappearing after 60 seconds.Date:  November 7, 2016.  Approximate Time:  Between 6:55 and 7:00 pm  Location: Snohomish, WA Latitude and Longitude:  Will be submitted in hardcopy report Night Sky:  Clear with a First Phase Moon   MY IMPRESSION: I was driving my grandchildren home on November 7, 2016, approximately 7:00 pm.  As I turned onto their street, I was mesmerized and held captive by what I saw and told the children to look up in the sky.  My 8 year old grandson exclaimed, “Nonna, what is that?”  I said it looks like some kind of UFO craft?   I slowed the car down and then stopped to view and it just seemed to drop or disappear below the tree line.  I quickly put the car in reverse to see if my position was the reason I could no longer see, but the objects were gone, no lights could be seen between the trees or in the night sky anywhere ~ they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.  As I pulled into my son’s driveway I told my grandson to go get his father while I unpacked the car all the while my 5 year old granddaughter was crying as she was frightened.  When my son came out of the house and we both heard and saw a very loud helicopter across the Valley in the vicinity of Harvey Air Field.It took a couple of days to process everything, but I did write everything down and attempted a crude drawing.  I knew I had to investigate further before submitting a report and contacted Harvey Air Field to have them check their Manifest to see if any helicopters were in the air around 7:00 pm on November 7th.  There were no helicopters at that time in the air - DEAD END. Later that day, I learned that there was in fact a helicopter in that vicinity and that they were doing Military Maneuvers.RECONSTRUCTING THE SIGHTING In an attempt now to reconstruct the shape and dimension of the crafts (I’ll  describe as objects for the time being), I first drew a large triangle and then at each of the three points I drew triangles - three equilateral as well as equidistant shaped triangles.Each triangular object was lit up with bright white lights that appeared to run along vertical lines moving upward to the top of the triangle which had pink or red lights at the base. The night sky was clear and the objects were illuminated by an unusually bright half moon.  Later, I looked up to see if there was in fact a half moon and learned it was a First Quarter Moon.There was no sound whatsoever and the objects seemed very close.  I don’t have the ability or science background to be able to report the exact size of the objects in relation to the planets and to the moon, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that what I saw were not planets or stars. When one sees planets and stars in the night sky they appear as tiny white dots, but what we saw were distinct objects ‘up close and personal’  as they say, clearly illuminated by the brightly lit moon.FINAL IMPRESSION:  The entire occurrence lasted no more than a minute, but something else occurred that has taken time for me to process as it defies logic.  As the objects seemed to drop below the tree line and disappear, it was at this point that I briefly took my eyes off the area to put my car in reverse and that is when I had a most unusual experience when I turned back around.  I will attempt to describe.I had the impression that the objects had not disappeared but were closer, or becoming larger, and passing overhead as I could see that the center area between the three triangular points was black, darker than the night sky, and all the lights were either dimmed or turned off ~ but I could see an outline.  It  was at this point that I knew that the triangular objects I saw were not three separate objects, but one large CRAFT.   It was gone with a blink of an eye, certainly a subjective experience and difficult to describe, but it was nonetheless my experience.ARTIST RENDERING I have an artist's drawing which I would like to submit, but I'm  unable to cut n' paste the digital picture into this document.

1921,"My husband and I went downstairs to let our dog out a little after 8 p.m. on Sunday, November 6, 2016.  I was facing west and looking up at the moon through the trees.  My husband had walked slightly around the side of the house and called me over saying, “I think there’s something here you would like to see.”  I walked over to my husband and we were both standing in the dark.  He pointed to the sky.  We both observed a group of approximately 12 to 15 orange lights drifting from east to north about 200 feet above the ground.It was a clear sky.There was no noise connected with this sighting, only silence.We did not observe any breeze or wind at ground level.The dog did not react in any way.We did not feel frightened or threatened.We did not receive any mental images or any thoughts of being contacted.We did not experience any missing time.We did not experience any further aerial or other phenomena that evening.We did not experience any strange dreams. When I first saw them, I said “Are those Chinese lanterns? I hope not because we are under extreme drought conditions.” I then went inside and got my Canon digital camera. My husband stayed outside, observing while I got my camera. We were standing in the dark. The backlit screen on my camera was extremely bright and annoying and was so bright that I could not put my eye up to the view finder in order to get good photos. Because we were in the dark, I could not find the movie feature. After a futile attempt to take some still photos, I gave up. The light from the backlit screen was too frustrating to deal with. I have not yet gone back to see if I captured anything on my camera. I turned the camera off and my husband and I stood there, observing. The lights glowed steady. They did not flicker or blink on/off. They seemed to drift as a group and did not seem to bob up and down or sideways. They drifted steadily together. The lights did not form any sort of discernible shape or pattern. The lights did not seem to be piloted or under intelligent control. Nor did they weave, bob, or dart around. To me, the lights were not round orbs. To me, they looked as if they had a vertical portion, with a brighter glow at the bottom (toward the earth) section of the vertical portion and due to that extra brightness, the bottom portion sort of appeared like more of a roundish light. The time noted after the lights drifted out of view was 8:08 p.m. This was the first day of standard eastern time as daylight savings time had ended at 2 a.m. the morning of Nov. 6 and I had set the downstairs clock to the “new” time earlier in the day on Nov. 6.

1926,"3 orb-like objects, one caught on videoOn November 6th at about 2pm central time, my wife and I were loading some items into a trailer in preparation for a move.  She sat down to take a short break and scanned the sky. Watching the sky when we are outside is and has been a habit we've adopted over the last 2-3 years.  A minute or two into her break she noticed an object in the northeastern sky and pointed it out to me. It was difficult to locate but I was able to do so by using environmental reference points such as trees and the house.  What I saw appeared to me at first like a bright star as it was a stationary object but considering the time of day and the fact it was sunny and 65 degrees made this an unlikely explanation.  I cannot stress enough how difficult it was to see this thing. Unless you had your eyes directly trained on it, it vanished from sight even though it seemed to be metallic and reflecting sunlight. If my wife wouldn't have spotted it there's no way I would have seen it.  At this moment, I ran inside to get my son to see it for himself, which he did but only after directing him where to look exactly.  We sat there staring at it when my wife pointed out two other objects approaching from the southeast.  One looked like the object to the north but moving slow and the other had a reddish color but seemed to bend and twist as it moved towards our direction.  It changed course a few times going left or right and moved at about half the speed of a mid to high altitude airliner appears to move.  These objects also seemed to ""disappear"" when not focused directly on them so when I looked away it took effort to find them once again. At this point I ran into the house to get my camcorder which is a Panasonic HC-W570.  I knew that I had 35-40 minutes of battery left but when I got outside and started to try and find the objects again, the battery indicator dropped all the down and I didn't even get a chance to record a single frame before it just died.  Disappointed, my family and I continued to watch.  The two moving o! bjects h ad fully vanished or faded but the original one still remained.  That's when I had the idea to grab the power supply for the camcorder and plug it in to an exterior outlet at the front door. It took me a few minutes to get close to zooming in on the UFO as the camera doesn't have a physical viewfinder, only the lcd screen.  Zooming into 90x also makes any handheld camerawork very unstable. Eventually, using the trees in the front of the house as a reference for locating the object in the sky, I got lucky for just a couple seconds to be able to get it in focus.  Almost as if it was playing hard to get, it would move just close enough to the tree in my line of sight for the camera to lose focus and shift to focusing on the branches.  So each time I would have to readjust my position by a few inches and start over again trying to find it in the sky.  After all this, the UFO faded into the color of the sky and ended our 20 minutes of excitement and bewilderment.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Mequon, WI",Occurred : 11/6/2016 14:00  (Entered as : 11/06/16 14:00),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 11/16/2016 9:31:50 AM 09:31,Shape: Changing

I looked up towards the western sky and saw what at first appeared to be a airplane with a white blinking light moving at normal speed for a plane, but then  noticed that the blinking light seemed to jump a substantial distance farther back all of a sudden, I thought that either my eyes were playing tricks on me or that clouds may have been obscuring the lights as they blinked.  Then I realized they were not any clouds in front the plane and that the lights were jumping a big distance, then up or across and back, way up to the front in too large of a distance and at the same time I then noticed that I could see a big black shape that was darker than the sky behind it, the under belly of a big triangular craft!!!

She was angry because her and the kids thought something was wrong.  My wife looked up and saw the lights just as they were going out of sight over the trees.  She didn't get a chance to see the lights and see how big the craft was, she was too ticked I scared the kids that she didn't care about the sighting, but she did notice that black huge shape drifting out of sight with the thing!

1938,"Saw a cluster of 5-6 lights, fading in and out, slowly moving within proximity to each other but also moving as a pack.I am writing this on Thursday, November 10th, regarding a strange occurrence I witness Saturday, November 5th, between roughly 9:45 and 10:15 and again, briefly, on Sunday, November 11th.Last Saturday, my wife and I were getting ready to watch a movie.  As she normally does when we watch a movie, my wife began making popcorn.  I went outside to walk around.  This last summer I purchased a FitBit (pedometer) and I sometimes walk up and down our long driveway to meet my step count goal.  We live just outside the city, on the margins of town, so while we are not completely in the country we usually have a clear view, if it is not too cloudy, of the sky.  On this Saturday night, many of the constellations were out, it was so clear.  Pacing back and forth on my driveway, listening to a podcast on my phone, with my earbuds in, I was struck by a set of, what appeared to be, constellations roughly 30 degrees north east of our location.  This pattern of what I presumed to be stars were among the lowest and closest to Earth of all the stars in the sky.What struck me upon given these “stars” a  second look was that they were fading and reappearing with increments of maybe 3-5 second.  Had it only been one light doing this, I would have quickly assumed it was a satellite, but this appeared different because satellites are never clustered.  There were five, possibly six, of these lights, fading in and out of visibility, out of sync with one another.  There was no specific clear pattern or shape to them, although they were spread out from each other in what looked like a skewed pentagon (like a small child attempting to draw a pentagon).  One of the lights was somewhat more central to the others and the fading in and out appeared a second slower than the others, although it was hard to tell because, again, they were out of sync.Staring at this with some disbelief, I moved into the road for a clearer view.  There was a large tree in the distance which I was using to gage the location and movement of this cluster.  No movement was visible to the eye, but after about ten minutes I could see that this cluster had indeed moved northbound and lower toward the ground.  Using my phone, I called my wife inside the house and asked her to please come outside to look at something.When my wife walked outside the door, I flagged for her to come over toward the road.  I pointed to the cluster saying, “there is a cluster of what looks like stars over there”, while pointing vaguely toward their direction.  I stopped myself, however, realizing this might plant a seed in her mind of what I wanted her to see.  I wanted her view to be as objective as possible.  My wife is much more of a skeptic than myself.  She almost immediately noticed what it was I was talking about.  She, too, found it very curious and unusual.  Assuming there was probably an explanation, quickly getting cold (the temperature was in the lower-to-mid 30s), and hungry for popcorn, my wife, after a couple of minutes, went inside.  I stayed a few minutes longer, so that I could store in my memory what I was seeing.After watching the movie, which I had trouble focusing on at first, I popped back outside to see if I’d notice anything else unusual.  By this point, the sky had become so foggy that no stars or anything else were visible.I would have written this experience closer to the date it occurred, but having a 2-year-old, being a teacher, and on the cusp of an election, I had not found time to sit and write this until now.It is worth noting that the next night I did go out to observe.  I noticed one light, slightly stronger than any I’d seen the previous night similarly fading in and out.  On this night, unlike the night before, I was intoxicated and became anxious and panicked pretty quickly, so I only looked long enough (30-60 seconds) to confirm with myself what I was seeing, but otherwise went back inside rather abruptly.  I have always had a long interest in UFOs and stories of encounters, so I am very familiar with phenomenon stories, though, prior to this, had none of my own.  Knowing that I am prone to believe such events, it was important to me to get confirmation from my wife that the pattern I observed was both real and unusual.  She agreed.  Even this morning, when I told my wife I would document my experience, she again confirmed for me that this pattern was uncanny.  Additionally, several dogs in the neighborhood were barking or howling.  Also worth noting is that the pattern I witness was placed, more or less, over the vicinity of our local airport.",Duration:30 minutes,"Location: Ithaca, NY",Occurred : 11/5/2016 21:45  (Entered as : 11/05/16 21:45),Posted: 11/11/2016,Reported: 11/10/2016 11:12:14 AM 11:12,Shape: Light

Didn't thank much of it but fr some reason i kept watching it.  Next i thought i saw it move about 3 inches in the sky so I asked my Fiancee to pull over.  She stopped the car and I got out watching it and it started to move towards my house.  There is an airport which would be behind me about 25 miles.  So I had her turn off the car to see if maybe we could here an engine or anything.  No sound at all coming from this craft.  So I got in the car and basically followed it as it was headed towards my house.  The Rd I live on is a staight away for about 12 miles.  When we got to the house I got out and it had stopped as it looked like it was probably 7 to ten miles away and maybe 100 Feet in the air.  So I continued to watch this object, as it was sitting still.  When I found the craft in my telescope it was a circle and looked like individual solid white lights all around it. So basically it was a circle of lights that looked like it was barely flickering. I went in the house to get a better lens for my telescope and it was gone when I got back but stood still for approximately 35 minutes.  I got home tonight at 9:00PM and there was a light in the same spot as I watched it for about ten minutes.

1944,"Witessed what appeared to be 2 satellites in tandem--then later--odd grouping of flickering lightsTwo incidents-same night 5 Nov  2016 beginning approx. 1855hrs (PST) I was sitting in my driveway, with a (roughly) 1/3 moon in the south western sky at around 45 degrees in the sky, which was/is quite clear and free of clouds.Many nights, I sit out looking at the stars, moon and planets—I’ve been doing this for decades (I am 53).  In the past year I acquired a good pair of binoculars, Zeiss 15x60 that are excellent for observing.  I was curious if I would witness any meteors tonight, so I had the binoculars hanging from my neck, was leaning back, just letting my eyes adjust to the dark.  I had my eyes closed for brief a few moments, maybe a minute to give them a rest—when I opened them I was looking up at about 80 degrees, looking south when I saw what I automatically assumed was a satellite (a common sight at night—I have seen as many as 6-9 in a couple hours.)  This time was different—it was not one, but two—that seemed to be moving in tandem.  The one further west was ahead by a few degrees, but there were certainly two, traveling together.  I raised the binoculars to look for any possible detail that might identify them as just high flying aircraft.  I observed no flashing lights, just somewhat steady, white light, that faded as the hurriedly traveled southwest-toward and past where the moon was in the sky.This was the first time I’ve witnessed two, so I rationalized this may have been two very, very high and fast moving military aircraft (I discounted any idea that these were civilian aircraft)—that would be illogical to assume they were civilian as civilian aircraft are nearly always commercial in nature, and fly to make money.2nd incident Roughly 30 minutes later I was sitting in the same spot just outside my garage door facing south.  I was looking directly overhead into the dark sky looking for a satellite to pass.  At 1925 hrs (PST) I observed a faint moving light, extremely high in the sky that I identified as a satellite moving directly south.  I brought my binoculars to bear on the object and observed it moving rapidly, the field of stars in the background clearly visible.I did this for maybe 10 seconds and as it passed through a field of stars I noticed what first appeared to be flickering lights/stars just to the east by maybe 1 degree.  I stopped following the satellite as that appeared fairly routine but focused on the flickering lights.  What struck me was these lights were not moving quickly—they in fact appeared stationary in the sky (as compared to surrounding stars)—I have seen countless aircraft at night—they are easy to identify—usually almost always you can see 2-3 lights, 1 green, 1 red on either wingtip—sometimes if low enough you can see steady lights from the fuselage-this group of lights—flickering faintly, appeared to not fit this pattern at all.I kept watching the group of lights for well over a minute—they did move—slightly, and slowly—but there was no uniformity or consistency to it.  I compared it to what you witness when you see artillery or even lighting far in the distance.  No sound, random sudden brightness with no real pattern-purely random.  Like I say, the light “pattern” moved but was very high, much higher than I am used to seeing flying aircraft-and as mentioned aircraft lights flicker or blink as well as appear steady as they move across the sky.  On a clear night you can even see contrails—none of this applied to these ‘lights’.  I even remarked to myself that it appeared to be a moving battle---but in the atmosphere.  Very high up in the atmosphere.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Mr. Davenport—I was reading your announcement on the NUFORC website about looking out for hoaxes etc—just wanted to clarify that mine was not.

1946,"Strange Orange Lights over the Alaska Range While Flying from Anchorage to FairbanksThis was on flight 2811 from Anchorage to Fairbanks (south to north).  I was sitting in row 3 on the right side of the Q400, looking out to the east/northeast.  As we climbed just above the cloud layer to cruising altitude over the Alaska Range, I first noticed 2 bright orange lights fade in and then out right above the clouds off to the northeast.  The still bright ""supermoon"" was out, and the stars will clearly visible in the sky.  I exclaimed ""what was that?"" out loud, but most others were sleeping or otherwise occupied.  I looked for a reflection inside the aircraft that might have caused this anomaly, but seeing nothing I continued to press myself to the glass to look for it again.  A few minutes later, several groups (2-3 in each tight group) of these bright lights appeared to the right of the moon, a little above the horizon.  They almost looked like little flames fading in and out. They glowed bright, way brighter than stars.  They would fade out, and then repeat again approximately 5-6 more times over the next 10 minutes.  We were already beginning descent into Fairbanks, which was overcast and snowing.  I kept watching for more, but lost the entire field of view as we descended into the clouds and then landed.  Fairbanks was socked in with snow, so there was no way this could have been seen from town if looking southeast towards the Alaska Range.  I have no idea what this was.  My only thought was fighter jet engines burning in the distance as they did exercises?  The lights were a fair distance away and didn't really move, however.  They faded in and then faded out in place, about 8-10 seconds each time.  I'm quite a skeptical person, but this is the strangest thing I've ever seen out of an airplane.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I figured it wasAt approximately 5:45pm my girlfriend stepped outside and noticed a ""UFO"" in the sky and called me outside. I figured it was probably a plane since Newark airport isn't far away and we frequently have airplanes overhead.  At 5:53pm we noticed a single bright ball of light in the distant sky.  We both felt this was NOT an airplane so she got her camera out.  Then slowly more objects appeared.  The largest/original object grew smaller as it appeared to move away from us.  Simultaneously, one by one, up to 6 objects appeared in the same area of sky.  Then they seemed to move into a single file formation for a duration.  Then this single file formation was broken and the objects spread out and slowly got smaller and disappeared from our visibility.  They appeared to be flying south - southeast (away from us).A mother and daughter came up to the front porch to drop off local political campaign flyers and they saw them as well and were dumbfounded. My girlfriend's 8yr old son saw them too. He quickly went inside because things like this can scare him.At first we thought they were planes reflecting the setting sunlight. However, there were several airplanes in the area and it was obvious by the naked eye and in the photographs that these looked much different and weren't planes. When you zoom into the photos you will see airplanes for comparison. The second theory was that they were meteorites/space debris but they don't change flight paths the way these did. My girlfriend, a professional photographer, got her Canon 5D camera out with Canon 70-300mm zoom lens and took pictures. The picture names have numbers in them so you can see the order of occurrence and track the flight paths accordingly.

The sky was extremely clear, and there was not a  single cloud in sight anywhere to be seen.As I was driving South on Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia, I was passing right at the area of Route 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and Oxford Avenue, and I was in the far  left lane of the middle lane. I just happened to look up at the sky in front of me and to the left, when I noticed what I right away assumed to be just a white cloud  stationary and not at all moving up in the sky.After passing Oxford avenue, I got stuck at the next traffic light.  I kept looking at the object and noticed that it was not moving at all, and that there were no  clouds anywhere in the entire sky.  As I kept staring at it, I thought it was a very starge looking cloud, and then very quickly realized it was not a cloud at all.When I realized this was not a bird, cloud, or an airplane or helicoptor, or any known aviation object I have ever seen before, I asked my passenger, ""Do you see that  up there?, What is that?""  He was amazed just like me and we sat in traffic for about 30-90 seconds just staring at it. It was not moving at all, niether were we.  That  is how we know it was not moving.I was driving, and because we both were staring in confusion at just what exactly we were looking at, it never occured to either one of us to get a photo of it with  our phones.  I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway. We started driving again, and I could see it starting to move downwards, or in the direction coming closer to  the ground.  But it was very, very high up in the sky, and it was oviously very big.In front of me and to the left there were high trees, and we both lost sight of the object for a few seconds, then we saw it again after passing the trees off the side  of the road.  We came to another traffic light and were stopped.  And then thats when we could see it more clearly, and we had the trees as an eye-sight-marker, as the  object was in back of the foreground trees in our sight.So once we were stopped we could clearly see the object more visible in detail and how it was movong and traveling using the tree as a marker. It kept moving downward in back of the trees, and as soon as we started driving again, when we got out in the open more where the sky was more open and visible, thats when we saw them. 3 more  of the same exact kind appeared out of nowhere to the left of the first object we saw.We dont know if they were already there and were just obscured by the trees or not, but I only saw the one at first, when the viewable sky was all open for my vision.And like I stated above, it initially was not moving and was actually closer.  The more we drove in it's direction (South) the further away it became.  It was oviously  movong very fast.There were a total of 4 objects in the sky, and they were all the exact same shape and white-brightness, still not known if it was the sun refecting off the object, making it so bright during that time of day, at least thats how I percieved what I was looking at. My passenger said that the other 3 to the left just dissapeared and  then reappeared right in the air.  I did not see that myself.The Description of the Object: - It was a very bright-white, possibly from the sun reflecting off it's surface, and it was either the shape of a cigar, but it was tilted. And when it moved, it  stayed titled, no matter which direction it moved, the tilt stayed. Im not sure about the cigar-shape, but I would describe it more like this: If you took a frisbee  and looked at it directlyin front of you looking at the side, so you not seeing a circle, but the other way, it would look like a sstraight line, but slightly ovaled,  but then on top of that, tilt it so that the left end it pointed down and the right end is pointed up.There were no colors or visible features, but it was also very high and far away to be able to clearly see it. When I thought it was traveling downwards closer to the  ground, I really think it was traveling further away. That is how fast it was moving. It, and the other 3 just kept getting smaller and smaller, you could tell they  were moving very fast. And as it moved, like I mentioned, the ""tilt"" of the object never changed.Still driving, I looked to the right up in the sky to see if there were more of these things, and that's when I saw, very, very high up, 3 jets/planes of some kind,  looked to be classic silver/metal in color of a jet, traveling in the same direction as the objects. All 3 jets were moving what seemed to be slow compared to the  other 4 objects. Each jet was leaving a clear small air vapor behind itself which quickly dissapated.As soon as I turned my head away from the 3 jets to the right sky, I watched the 4 objects to the left start moving extremely fast, as if they just caught wind of the  3 jets coming their way. If these were, oviously, military jets sent up to observe or chase these objects, they would most likely have been sent from Willow Grove Air  Force base in Warminster, Pennsylvania, which was roughly 20 miles away from our driving location. They must have gotten there quick, because when I first looked  around after seeing the first object not moving at all, I saw nothing else anywhere. And the 3 jets were pretty high up.At this point we both observed the 4 objects, which seemed to be each about 2 miles apart from each other, and the other 3 further ahead now from the 1st object we  witnessed, traveling at great speed, still with the ""tilt"" not changing at all, all 4 objects within 3 seconds, just took off southbound at incredible speed, and then  they just dissapeared over the horizon.To describe the 1st object, as it was stationary and not moving in better detail, it just hung in the sky, like a cigar, tilted, shining very bright white, as if the  sun was reflecting off it, I am pretty good at judging distance with my eyes, so just a guess, I would say it was about 1-2 miles in length, and roughly about 5-6  miles away. I really wish I could have got a photo of it when is was just sitting there in the sky, but I was driving and it all happened to fast.This was the first time for both of us ever seeing an object we could both say was a UFO for sure. If it was a black-project type object, who knows. But we are  absolutely both sure of what we witnessed, and this was not a mistaken known aircraft. And also we both have never seen such a thing, or expected to ever see such a  thing in this area of Northeast Philadelphia where we were at the time.The entire thing was very strange.  We did look around at other drivers to see if they were looking up at it too, and we did not see anyone looking at it.  Although,  people were driving, it would have been hard to have witnessed it, unless you were stuck at a light, and just happened to look up.I even had my window rolled down with my head out the window, so I know my vision was not obscured in anyway.  That was it.  The objects vanished once they took off  southbound at an incredible high rate of speed, staying at their ""tilt"" in the sky, and 30 minutes later, the sun was gone and that was the end of it.  We witnessed nothing else afterwards as we drove in the opposite direction going home.",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Philadelphia, PA",Occurred : 11/5/2016 17:15  (Entered as : 11/05/16 17:15),Posted: 11/11/2016,Reported: 11/6/2016 6:44:52 AM 06:44,Shape: Other

1979,"Massive ufo sighting- very clear  (ufo account is reported with a 30yr personal past of knowledge of sky objects, drones, aircraft, military aircrafts, astronomy, and the like)  after midnight location: downtown old Hollywood area near 101 fwy and franklin junction. i pulled my car into the 101 cafe on franklin blvd back parking lot which has a 30 degree and up view of a clear night sky with a west, north, and east. as i parked my car i quickly sighted a large blue white object in the nw sky about 35 degrees up from horizon through my wind shield. my iphone read 2:17am. instantly i jumped out to investigate and questioned to my partner what was in the sky. at the same time as i spoke this question, a female  witness at her car behind us joined in with us to question the same object as she just had spotted it as well. nw west toward the Hollywood bowl in the Hollywood hills- Mullholand Drive region an object was gracefully flying over those hills which was a clear mile distance from us. the object was flat. it's underbelly was a soft, radiant, blue white light in a honey-comed patterned shape. very faint aura around the object. the object's speed! , resembled the grace of a blimp, very directional and straight, yet very gradual and slow in shift of direction overall through the experience. the object was heading east towards us and it's speed was cruising, causal, slow, yet the light detail resembled a superstructure in a blue-white, honey-combed pattern that was entirely luminous. no landing lights, no blinking lights, no conventional aircraft resemblance. this was a solid, luminous shape that did not pulsate or change intensity in lumination or brightness. it moved gracefully without abrupt turns. just smooth, clearly indicating behavior of a large craft, like a aircraft carrier or blimp would, and like these examples, one realized it gained distance in a short amount of time. we were now 3 witnesses trying to identify the craft. we quickly agreed the craft was not anything we were ever familiar with, as we all have much flying experience. Iam a drone owner as well, and this was not the behavior of a drone with zig! zag action or it's type of lights. about a minute of observat! ion, we agreed the craft with this behavior easily was in the measurement of 100ft across at least as it dwarfed the structures below on the hills at an 1500-2000ft elevation above the hills. slowly and gradually the craft turned easily north east gradually gaining altitude as it flew over the 101FWY Cahuenga Pass. About after another minute it was clear the craft was gracefully gaining extreme altitude, and due to elevation it's craft detail was getting smaller as it finally settled over the Hollywood sign mountain. The craft peaked about 5000ft above the mountain and paused it's NE direction. it hovered still perfectly without a bump for about another minute. Through this time again the craft was gaining more altitude. about another 30 seconds of this slow climb, the craft slowly flew southward to our direction. the honey-combed lit pattered was so tiny from it's height, yet still identifiable. it's movement and behavior resembled that of high space satellite. the craft eventually! was now spotted by two more witnesses as they were entering the cafe, as we were all in agreement of tracking the craft. The slow path and asension ended directly above us about 7000-8000ft as it hovered in place for another 5 minutes. as the craft paused, to our view it parked itself near two stars creating an even triangle constellation of sorts. these two stars' location are the first pair NE of the orion left shoulder. after this pause the craft gained an altitude in where it now resembled that of a tiny satellite, or the size of the neighboring stars, and like a slow satellite it traveled directly west over west hollywood as it's slow path was just north of the Orion constellation. the object was exactly star size as it faded westward gaining altitude, yet still identifiable well past west of Hollywood Blvd & Fairfax blvd. the entire event was about 27 minutes as it was slow and gradual as stated before. i then cell phoned west Hollywood sheriff to report the sighting! and the officer stated there were no reports of the event. i ! then con tacted the next major airport at Burbank which was about 12 miles away. by this hour the airport has stopped it's regular commercial airline service at 10pm that night. i got through to Burbank tower security who accepted my story and he then transferred me to the actual tower. a stand by night watch tech took my call. I asked if anyone was watching radar in the south direction of 2:17am. he stated he wasn't watching radar at that time. iIdescribed my sighting to him, he sounded interested, but after he claimed he still never had evidence on radar, nor looked, therefore he stated he had to go and hung up on me. this craft had no similarity to the usual police helicopters or commercial aircraft that we see by the dozens daily in the area with our 3 major commercial airports. We do have Edwards afb but it's a 2 hours drive north. but this was no stealth plane outline nor was it the dark large air force x-baloon triangle ship. we haven't had lighted blimps in years since Goodye! ar stopped that action, nor could a blimp fly that hight out of sight or hover in place. it was not a large manned drone, as it would have been way too small in dimension, also the guide lights on a drone were not the same. nor could a drone have scaled that altitude for that duration and without one single abrupt zig zag kind movement. our sighting was a big luminous craft, with smooth acceleration, ending in high altitude without a flinch. lots of citizens in L.A., please respond if there are any other eyewitnesses. sighting was 2:17 - 2:45am 11/4/2016",Duration:27 minutes,"Location: Hollywood, CA",Occurred : 11/4/2016 02:00  (Entered as : 11/4/2016 2:00),Posted: 12/5/2016,Reported: 12/5/2016 3:05:26 AM 03:05,Shape: Chevron

The object hangs in the North sky with shining lights.  It is not a star!!!

I tried looking at it with binoculars but it's not good sighting when I'm shaking.  I'm going to try to get a telescope to get a better look.  My husband got involved with the siting last night and agreed it is not a star.  After about an hour I walked into my bedroom and saw the light through the window facing East.  The window is a trapezoid window and high, so I had to climb on the headboard to look out.  The light was there and then looking a little below I saw another one.  This is not our imagination!!!  This is what my grand daughter and I chased last week and it does move.  It is not a plane or helicopter.  This is not a drone!!  Remember my grand daughter saw the disk as it flew past the house.

1986,"I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, before any stars were shining.I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, after sunset and before any stars were shining.  I had been walking down the sidewalk for an hour, and was looking at the sky after I noticed some thin noctilucent clouds directly overhead.  The two white, circular lights caught my attention where there were no clouds, about 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were of equal size (I estimate 60 feet diameter) and equal brightness, about 3 fingers apart with my arm outstretched in front of my eyes.  That is way too far apart from each other to be aircraft landing lights from a single aircraft, at what seemed like a distance of about 3 miles, South-East of downtown.I watched the 2 lights closely for 4 seconds, and noted they seemed absolutely motionless.  Then, I looked down at my cell phone for 3 seconds, in order to start my camera application, and by the time I looked back up to take a photo, both lights had disappeared. I continued walking home and watching that section of the sky for another half an hour, and they did not re-appear, neither did any stars.  During that following half an hour, any approaching aircraft would have already arrived and landed at the city airport, which was on the other side of me from the lights, and I would have easily seen any aircraft landing lights approaching and heard aircraft engines, because they would have had to pass over me to get to the airport.  Besides, aircraft do not approach the city airport from the South-East.I am a U.S. Navy Veteran Seaman of Deck Department, a trained look-out watch, having spent 3 years at sea, and experienced at identifying stars, planets, satellites, aircraft lights, etc.  There are never military fighter jets operating in this area, and only rarely are there lone military helicopters, and never flying in pairs.

1987,"11/03/16; 15 white lights traveling west to east in Charlotte NC at 19:10. 2-3 minutes observing themIn Charlotte, North Carolina (28227) at approximately 7:10pm, on Thursday, 11/03/16, my wife and I observed 15 white lights (circular) moving in formation and they appeared to be independent of each other.  They were no brighter than the surrounding stars.  They moved from the west going east (75 degrees WNW according to my cell-phone compass). They were directly overhead and appeared to us to be at an altitude of in-flight commercial aircrafts.  They traveled as fast as commercial planes at cruising altitude. There was no sound and they traveled in a straight path.  There was some position changing within the formation.  According to weather.gov, the wind was calm at 18:53 and 5 mph from the SW at 19:53.  Our observation was at 19:10. We did not feel or observe any wind.At first sight, I was alone. I saw 10 white lights (round) in a staggered row from left to right with 5 trailing in a 2-1-2 pattern.  I went to get my wife so she could see/confirm.  This took 15-20 seconds.  Upon our return outside, the staggered row contained 12 white lights and three were trailing in a 2-1 pattern.  They did not appear to blink, but periodically, a few would indiscriminately fade out then back to full glow.  This process took 2-3 seconds.  It was a clear, cloudless night.

1989,"Small silent disc - like object over Northern Outer Banks, NCAt approximately 7:45 on the morning of November 3, 2016, I exited my car at work and noticed a piece of trash in the parking lot near my car.  I picked it up and began walking toward the entrance of the business I manage.  I looked up and saw an object off to my forward right that seemed to be gliding silently in a soft arc over the North side of the building.  It remained in view from that point until it disappeared as a speck over the Atlantic Ocean.  After making the turn over the building it remained in a perfect straight path directly out over the ocean.  The sun had risen to the right of the direction in which the object flew.On first seeing it, I wondered what it was.  It was dark gray in color and appeared to be what I would describe as two offset discs connected in the middle somehow.  From the angle I was observing from, what appeared to me to be the bottom portion of the object was perfectly round and mainly flat, with the top portion mainly obscured except a small section that seemed to be projecting forward, in the direction the object was flying.  As it banked it appeared similar to the Nazi “SS” symbol.  It was as though the two discs were connected with some space in between.The object was small.  It may have been thirty six to forty eight inches across.  At first I thought it could be a balloon or something being carried on the wind, but there was absolutely no wind at all, and it was moving steadily at maybe fifteen or twenty miles per hour.  At no point did the speed deviate and at no point the elevation change.  It did not move from side to side at all.  Once it turned out toward the ocean it seemed to fly in a perfectly straight line until it was out of sight.As it banked I called out to an employee who was in the parking lot.  He was able to observe it as it flew away.  To him it was just a spec that flew silently and very straight.  I told him I was not freaking out but that I did not know what it was.  I told him that if it shoots off at an angle at Mach 6 I would freak out.It was not a bird or any earthly creature.  I got the sense that it was a drone, given its size.  After going to my office for a few minutes I went out to the beach to see if I could see anything.  On the extreme horizon I did see a shape that looked rectangular like a ship would at that distance.  I have no reason to believe there is a correlation between that ship and the object.If it was some sort of high tech military drone then they have developed technology to fly objects in complete silence.The weather was perfectly clear with few clouds in the sky and the sun low on the horizon to the east.I photographed it using my cell phone as it flew away.  I also tried to photograph the ship on the horizon.  I also sketched it from the two angles I saw it from.  I am not happy with the “SS” angle sketch but think it is as close as I can get to what I saw.  The double disk sketch is very accurate.I am a 56 year old adult male business manager.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Corolla, NC",Occurred : 11/3/2016 07:45  (Entered as : 11/03/16 07:45),Posted: 11/4/2016,Reported: 11/3/2016 6:10:45 AM 06:10,Shape: Disk
