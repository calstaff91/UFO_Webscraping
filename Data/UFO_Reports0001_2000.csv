1,"Flickering white lights due west in a curved, symmetrical pattern, moving downward to the south.Looking from my bedroom window to the west, I saw 6 sparkling lights in the sky.  At first I thought that they were possibly airplanes, satellites, or twinkling stars, but they were bright and close enough together not to be planes.  They were slowly moving downward in a southern direction.  Two of them slowly faded away while holding their position, while the remaining four kept moving in a southern direction until I couldn't see them anymore.

It was probably one half mile from me in the still dark morning sky.  I was looking towards the west.As it hovered, the lights went around the perimeter of the circular object rotating white/orange.

7,"Orange fireball, flying horizontally, stops, hovers, drops hot liquid debris 4-5 times, then flies upwards into space.My husband saw a glowing orange sphere travel east to west outside our large factory window.  He told me to come see what he thought was a “helicopter on fire.”  The object was large, at least the size of a helicopter.  Planes coming and leaving La Guardia airport continued to fly in their usual paths.  They were distinguishable as planes. This object was indistinguishable.  It did not sparkle, but its colors shined with a twinkling quality, and its colors of orange and red rotated or mixed like lava.  It hovered as I approached the window and stayed completely stationary for about three minutes above buildings at about half a mile away.  It was soundless.  My husband said the sphere appeared to be dropping debris.  He saw glowing, orange debris drop four or five times.  I saw it drop debris the last instance.  The debris appeared to be liquid, like molten lava.  It dropped about 20-30 feet and disappeared.The orange and red sphere was only a sphere.  No tail, blade, or landing skids could be seen, which would have been illuminated had it been some kind of aircraft on fire.  At this point, my husband began taking a video with his iPhone. I became very alarmed, thinking, if it were a helicopter, it would be going down, without question, because for that much debris to fall, the interior of the helicopter would have to be completely aflame.  But there was no smoke and no actual flames.  Just the look of something hot and burning, which grew slightly in intensity.  The sphere seemed more to be emitting light than on fire.  Finally, the sphere started flying upwards.  We watched it ascend at a slight angle east another two minutes before it disappeared into far up into space traveling about as fast as a plane, but at an altitude much higher than we have seen planes fly.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: New York City (Brooklyn), NY",Occurred : 9/10/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 90/10/2017 22:30),Posted: 9/12/2017,Reported: 9/12/2017 12:58:32 PM 12:58,Shape: Fireball

Apparent size that of a penney held at arms length. Object was moving above or through broken clouds which may have contributed to a bit of transluscence.

I am not discounting the possibility that these could be aircraft perhaps heading towards either Florida or Texas for hurricane relief operations - but these ""aircraft"" had only a red light(s) as far as I could discern, and there were a lot of them following each other in a ""one by one"" procession.  They flew over neighboring Middletown, Ohio, which is next door to Monroe - at a relatively low altitude.  They did not originate from the proper direction of Wright Patterson AFB - but from farther North.  There were no unusual flight behaviors that would differentiate them from typical aircraft - but I could not hear any noise that I could directly associate with them.  The scene struck me as being very creepy.Neighborhood dogs were barking - but I was unsure if this was because of the objects - or because I was standing on my porch and they heard me making remarks such as, ""Oh my God!"" - and ""You must be ((word deleted)) kidding me!"".",Duration:15 minutes,"Location: Monroe, OH",Occurred : 9/9/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 09/09/2017 22:30),Posted: 9/12/2017,Reported: 9/9/2017 9:23:33 PM 21:23,Shape: Light

I was pulling off the main road onto my road and spotted the lights just above the tree line.  I drove downhill to the bottom of the road to follow the lights which were visible on and off through the trees and were moving southeast.  I lost sight of the lights at the dead end of the road.  Then I drove out onto route 447 north (as going south nothing would be visible due to tree cover) to see if I could spot them again.  I saw two of the three lights barely visible just above the horizon, for about 20 seconds before they disappeared.  There could have been some spotty cloud cover, so perhaps they just disappeared behind clouds, although the stars were visible when I was  back at my house.

Sort of like a lightning bug.  But it was above the clouds, which were at least a couple thousand feet.  When overhead, they were more white than orange. They seemed to be moving faster than a jet if it was 35,000 feet.  But only moving as fast as a fast small plane if it was a few hundred feet.  They covered way too much area, too fast and too high to be a drone, unless there are some serious long distance ones out there.  No blinks no sound at all.  They were rising 3 or 4 at a time.

43,"S-Shaped Black Tumbling Rotating UFO.Middle of the day.  Walked outside, looked up and there it was.  It was floating through the air, a dark S-shaped object, maybe teen feet or so in size - maybe a half mile or less in the sky.  These are guesses to size and distance.It tumbled through the sky, and also, the ends of the S would contract at times, then go back to an S shape - and also I did notice that it would also rotate horizontally, and when it did - it seemed as if it was 2-dimensional on that plane, otherwise tubular. At one time during the horizontal, I noticed a kind of yellow semi-transparent square projection shape go over it, in a flash of time. It strangely enough seemed to go directly over my field of view. I thought about it later, that I was feeling the wind from the opposite direction. As I had plenty of time, time of encounter 30+ seconds, I could not see or identify what it is, even observing it intently, and it did not appear to be a balloon of any kind.  There are no balloons sold in any local stores that match this.I then went on the internet to look for ""s-shaped ufo's"" and I found some others that have had similar sightings:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135145.htmlhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/s-shaped-ufo.494236/  Something about this seemed...organic, intelligent, and intentional - rather than simply a piece of trash or balloon floating in the wind.  I say this with all skeptical discernment, as it seemed to be tumbling, as it were-as a means of movement or self-propelling, such as the flagella of a cell moves, rather than simply being an object moved by a current.Unfortunately with these kinds of things, it just doesn't sound that impressive - I understand, as it probably would not to me if I read this report of a UFO without experiencing it directly my self.I am relaying this to see if anyone else has ever seen something like this, or has any ideas ... this is all true my story which I share.I do not have any cameras or phone to take a picture, sorry - but the video of the other sighting looks very similar, even exactly - except for the addition of the other details which I had observed.",Duration:30+ seconds,"Location: Everett, WA",Occurred : 9/7/2017 12:00  (Entered as : 09/07/17 12:00),Posted: 9/8/2017,Reported: 9/8/2017 9:19:28 AM 09:19,Shape: Other

After throwing some garbage away in a bag, I placed on the sidewalk next to my vehicle, I looked up at the sky randomly for some odd reason facing North East.  I watched three airplanes fly ahead.  But there was a fourth one…  The fourth one was glowing a golden hue and had a smaller orb of golden light flashing on the upper left side.  This smaller orb of light looked to be detached from the object but followed it in sync.  It was glowing and the golden lights were together in a curved disk shape at the bottom of the object.  It was moving to the right quite slowly, then it stopped dead in its tracks.  I sat there trying to calculate what I was seeing.  Something was off about it.  The other planes passing by had white and red flashing lights flying one direction, but this one stopped above the neighborhood above the tree line, lower in the level of the airplanes flying! past in the sky.I then said aloud, ""Alright, I see you B--- and I'm not afraid.  If you are paranormal prove it!.""And it then moved to the left!  The left side instead of the right! it commenced moving side to side as if it was proving its existence to me.

67,"15 to 20 brightly lit objects travelling in formation in the night sky.I was outside in my driveway around 11 pm last night.  I went outside to close the windows in my car.  I looked up to check out the full moon and over the next block I saw a brightly lit object moving overhead.(My house faces east and there are tall trees with two-story houses on the next block.  I have a clear view of the sky in front of my house about 3 properties wide on the other side.  I am located in the center of a small town about 2-3 miles wide)  It was completely calm out with no wind or clouds and there was no noticeable noise coming from the object.  The object was brightly lit, about 1-200 feet up and moving over the houses on the next block.  I continued to watch its movement and noticed another similarly lit object that cleared the tree line into my view a few seconds later.  It had the same bright redish/orange light and was following in the same line as the first object.  This continued for a few minutes with multiple objects (6 or so) coming into view and spread apart a few seconds.  The objects travelled in this straight line formation from south to north, turned east heading away from me, and then travelled another few seconds to turn north and moved out of my sight.During this group of objects, I heard my son coming down the stairs in the house so I called him out to see it.  The temperature was cool and we had all the doors/windows open in the house.  He thought it was weird and started getting all panicky since he didn’t know what it was.There was break of about a minute or two and we thought it was over.  Then another bright object cleared the trees from the south in the same line as the original group.  Over the next few minutes we saw another “group” of 6 or so objects travel the same path from south to north, make a turn to the east and turn north out of our view.  There was a break of another minute or two and a third group of 6 or so objects followed the same pattern.  After the third group, we waited 5-10 minutes but there was no reoccurrence of these objects.I have no idea what these were and I have not witnessed any similar event in the past.  15 to 20 brightly lit objects, in 3 groups travelling in the same formation, on the same path with multiple turns.

72,"Red/Yellow Blinking UFO dropped white lit object out of bottom, changed direction then nearly disappearedMy husband and I left my parents' house at 9:40PM on 9-3-17, we were backing out of their driveway when I saw these 3 strange lights vertically staggered in the distance.  My parents have lived in that house for the past 21 years, and I grew up there, these were NOT normal lights.  So, I immediately told my husband to look, and we quickly drove down the street to investigate the right/yellow blinking, yet stationary lights.That's when I took the first picture, it was too dark for my iPhone to get a good picture, so I circled the 3 dots in red because my phone couldn't focus.  We decided to go home the long way so we could follow the UFOs, we made it just down John Dodd Rd out of my parents neighborhood and we BOTH saw a white colored lighted object fall out of the bottom of the red/yellow blinking object.  We were flabbergasted!  We drove a little further and parked at the intersection of John Dodd Rd and New Cut Rd where I took the next picture and video that I attached.The red/yellow blinking objects were now coming very far apart in a single file path following one another.  They were headed West towards us, then the one coming closest dropped out another white lighted object out of the bottom, then waited a second and dropped another, it then turn right, and started heading N..  As soon as it began heading N, it disappeared from our sight VERY quickly.It was followed by 4 other red/yellow blinking UFOs.  They all followed the same path, and as soon as they all began to head N they disappeared so fast, but only the first one we saw after we stopped at the intersection dropped out two lit objects.As they were headed towards us, which was west, so we were looking east, they did not seem to be moving fast at all, and they definitely had the ability to hover in a stationary position as when we first saw them, and then they were stationary momentarily as they dropped things out of the bottom of their ship.It should also be noted that a jet flew above us during the sighting and was MUCH higher in the air than these objects were.I wouldn't put it past the government to be testing some random aerospace stuff, but the part that is seriously throwing us for a loop were the following things: 1 - Stationary first 2- Glowing objects released from the bottom 3 - Speed in which they disappeared after turning N, because they were not moving that quickly as they were headed west towards us 4 - They were fairly low to the ground, way below the jet that flew above us.I would be glad to answer any more questions that you may have.  Thanks for listening.  This is my second UFO sighting in my lifetime of 31 years, the other was in the Austrian Alps when I was 15 with my best friend, but we were young and never reported it.  I definitely believe in life outside of our tiny universe.

84,"Red lights traveling in the same general direction, moving slowly and steadily across the night sky.I am a 56 year old female, with two years of college education and I have worked in county government for 36 years.  My friend is 57 years old and an elementary school teacher.  She has a Bachelor’s and two Master’s degrees in the field of education.  Her husband is 72 years old and retired.  He Is a US Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, is also a college graduate.  He returned to this area and retired from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.  We are all from Fulton County originally and have lived in this area most of our lives.We were enjoying an evening campfire on their property which is located approximately 2 ½ miles southwest of Lewistown, IL.  Around 8:30 pm, I was kicked back in a zero gravity chair, when I noticed a mostly red light moving horizontally across the sky.  The way we were sitting, my friends had their backs to it, and so, I immediately started yelling for them to look!  We like to go to this same spot to enjoy the yearly Perseid or Leonid meteor showers and at first, I thought we were being treated to a rather large random meteor.  However, that was not the case.  It continued to move slowly across the sky in a southwest to northeast direction.  While we were focused on it as it moved away from us, I noticed another one coming from the same area!  It was the same thing, a solid, mostly red light, moving slowly and in a southwest to northeasterly direction.  When I say mostly red, it is because it did appear to have some white with it or around it.  My friend was able to get ! some video of it using her iPhone.Needless to say, this sparked some very lively discussion for a while as we speculated on a possible explanation for them.  There was no noise of any kind associated with them, they were not huge and we guessed they were flying at 500’ or less.  We almost immediately thought of them as drones of some sort, but, then wondered about the logistics and legalities of flying them at night?  We also thought it might be some sort of study being conducted by the Department of Natural Resources or some other such agency, perhaps studying animal activity at night?  Along those lines, we concluded that they were traversing the area in a grid like pattern.  We came to that conclusion because the trailing one, while appearing to follow the first, was offset, so to speak, flying at the same altitude, but, parallel to the first and not directly behind it.We were still in the same location, I was again kicked back in the zero gravity lawn chair and at 9:20 or so, when another one appeared!!  Same size, same color, everything.  It was much farther offset than the first two, but, traveling in the same general direction and at the same altitude and speed as the first two.  We waited and watched the sky for quite some time, thinking another “trailer” might be behind it, but, we didn’t see anymore.  We wondered, if perhaps, we had missed the lead one and the one we saw this time was the second one?  Again, there was no noise associated with it, nothing that would have made you look up, I just happened to be looking up.All three of them just moved steadily across the sky until they appeared to blink in and out until you couldn’t see them anymore.  We didn’t feel like they “disappeared.”  It was more like, they just got far away and probably went behind the cloud cover.  We left probably 40 minutes after the second sighting and went back to town.  None of us had seen anything like them before.",Duration:52 minutes,"Location: Lewistown, IL",Occurred : 9/2/2017 20:29  (Entered as : 09-02-17 08:29),Posted: 9/5/2017,Reported: 9/5/2017 11:54:10 AM 11:54,Shape: Light

I had already cleared the city, and was well on my way through the back country of the US 60 when the siting occurred.  It was roughly 20:15 and the sun was still setting to the west.  However, to the east, the sky was already dark.  As I came around a bend on the highway, I glanced towards a dark empty part of the sky.   The bearing of my sight was roughly 120 degrees SSE.  I noticed a light in the sky that appeared to have a reddish orange glow.  Upon further inspection, I noticed this light was more of an orb positioned just over the horizon, but close enough to tell that it was not a star in the sky.  The orb was so odd looking that I could not focus on anything but the light, only taking my eyes off it to glance back at the road.  Having a background in aviation communications I was quick to make the judgement that this was not an anti-collision light of any sort and not an aircraft light that I had seen in the past.  The glow was almost incandescent as opposed to having an LED appearance.  The orb did not waver at all.  It held its position, and that’s what I found so odd about it.  About 15-20 seconds in, the orb shot out an additional orb to the east of it.  The second orb maintained the same position once it shot out from the first orb.  Both orbs now were the same exact size and luminosity.  If I were to guess they were about 100 feet away from each other in the sky.  It was also apparent that the second orb traveled from the first orb to its position because a slight tracer of light was visible; the second orb did not just appear.  It traveled from the first orb to its position.  At this point, there were two identical orbs in the sky and just as I thought that was crazy enough, a third orb shot out from the second orb.  Now 3 identical orbs maintained their positions in the sky.  They did not move or flicker.

Looking straight out of our porch, (looking East-Southeast) in the distance, we saw a sliver of light, much like the moon coming through the clouds.  It was a bright yellowish orange color.  I could not say how far away it was, but it was definitely farther than a mile, if not more than that.  I pointed it out, and she thought it was the moon.  We continued to watch as the object got wider (to about the width of your thumb at arm's length).  There were clouds off in the distance, but no clouds that appeared thick enough to hide the moon.  It maintained a fairly symmetrical shape.  It almost looked like the ""angel decoy"" flare release from an AC-130 gunship, except if these were flares, they didn't fall, and it looked like a solid object.  The object would periodically appear to change size, and hue/brightness, shrinking to a small point, but it was seen to grow in size again, at least once.  Eventually, another object of similar color appeared next to the first (or appeared to split off from the first).

166,"satellite does rapid button hook maneuverI awoke at about 4:00 a.m. ( Aug – 25 ) and knew I couldn’t go back to sleep, so I got up and decided to read and perhaps grab a smoke out side, which is what I did.  At 4:30 a.m., I went outside and began to smoke, and as usual, I face north and star gaze and it was very clear, a little fire smoke haze but nothing bad.  An airliner was crossing the sky from W-NW  to  E-SE  and was north of my location, I enjoyed the stars as it headed to the Eastern horizon and I turned my head to look toward the western part of the sky for several seconds and turned my head back facing northerly again and saw a very bright satellite slightly north east of my location and headed the same path as the airliner, but the opposite direction.  It surprised me I hadn’t seen the hint of the satellite before I turned my head away, it was very bright and I watched it for ~ 10 seconds, and it began to fade in brightness, as is typical.I took my eye’s off of it to smoke and quickly decided it might flare up again, so I decided to attempt to quickly find it again, so I followed the path I had just seen, and saw a very dim satellite, slightly more north of the assumed path.  Here my brain is thinking how the satellite jumped off the straight line path if it was the same satellite, but very quickly, I notice this satellite is in a medium size turn, and not traveling straight.  I thought that this thing was going to head north now in view of this turn, (the turn can be best described as less then ¼ the circumference of a dinner plate at arm's length), and then the most fascinating thing happened, this very dim satellite brightened up and did what athletes call  “the button hook“ maneuver…  it accelerated rapidly in a very tight turn and shot back the direction in which it had come from.  I wondered if it was going to trail that airliner.This was no jet or satellite, this craft was moving at an astonishing speed at the end, and I will surely keep a closer watch on satellites from now on.  Are ufo’s now mimicking satellites so as to be less noticeable, it sure seems like it to me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

210,"In Nashville, Tennessee, on August 21, during the full eclipse, I saw what I believe to be a UFO.  Everybody around me said yeah right that's a UFO whatever, you're crazy, yeah he's in the UFOs and all that, all the mean stuff that people say when they don't believe what they're looking at.I don't believe it to be any normal aviation aircraft as they don't move this fast.  I did happen to click two or three photos of it but it had already gone from bright red to white.  You do see the outline of it in the photos.  Photos are always grainy it seems when you want to get a clear photo.So we were about to see the full eclipse looking south of where we were and up in the sky wants the eclipse took over everything went pretty dark but you could still see a horizon if you turn 360°.  It was absolutely beautiful we saw the eclipse through the eyeglasses and there is nothing like it.  I turned around and was admiring everything else and as the sun started to come back out the area Brighton to back up and as it did I saw a red light in the sky. most red lights we see here in Nashville move around across the sky very slowly and generally are blinking because they're attached to an aircraft they don't move up and down and don't move very quickly at all.  What I saw moved from in the clouds in my perspective about 2 inches down from the cloud area to below The cloud area in a matter of milliseconds.  Absolutely no aircraft can move that fast.  That's to my knowledge at least.Now of course the 10 or 12 people around me I started telling them do y'all see that red light in the sky and as I told them it move down very fast and stopped the red light started to turn white and then it started to sending back to the earth and very slowly disappeared behind the tree line.  Now this craft was not 100 feet away I'm sure it was at least 1 to 5 miles away.In some of the photos that I took I pointed at where it was coming down after everything happened.  So I could document exactly where it was and see if there was some aviation thing that the government may have been tested.  I'd love for someone to check that out and get back to me but I'm pretty sure I know what I saw and it moved extremely fast from one point to the next as many UFOs that are reported do.  And courage everyone to check this out as this is the first one I have ever seen if it is a real UFO and it was very exciting.

212,"Dark anomalous object appears in a photo taken during the maximum of the partial solar eclipseDuring the onset of the partial solar eclipse in Colorado Springs, my partner and I took photographs of what appeared to be small stratus clouds forming over the mountains -- as outdoor air temperatures dropped with the temporary reduction in solar heating.  We took 9 photos over a 5 minutes period, between 11:46 am and 11:51 am Mountain Time.  Our home has an excellent view of Pikes Peak, the mountain range west of the city and we frequently take weather photos.We reviewed the photos a few hours later and first noticed the anomalous dark image in the second picture taken at 11:47 am.  It was taken with a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 smartphone.  What’s ironic is that, when taking the photo, we saw a long cloud formation over the southern flank of mountains and I said aloud in jest “that looks like a mother ship”.   The anomalous dark object is above and to the left of the long cloud formation in the photo.  The dark object is a bit blurry but obvious to the eye.  No other photos taken have shown anything unusual, apart from the small cloud formations which quickly formed in an otherwise clear sky and then dissipated after the solar eclipse.We’re used to seeing large birds, planes, helicopters, even drones, fly the skies in our area.

I went and took your advice and uploaded a bunch of videos and made a youtube page so here is the link:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzXmN_nmfoPcmPrqw38QN4A  So on the morning of aug 21st i was awoke around 430am and thought it was to early to let the dogs out (i usually wake up around 630am to do this)  and the next think i knew i was at my front window peeping out and my phone starts ringing from a strange number and kept making my phone light up.  i did not answer given the time but then when i checked my phone later after i remembered (it was all a blur) the numbers were no longer in my missed calls.  So after the call thing the next thing i remember is standing at my back door about to let the dos out. I noticed the light across the lake doing things it I’ve never noticed (I’ve lived here for 4 years) and when i asked my buddy who lives next door to him he said the guy doesn’t even have a light and that it is a reflector.  Anyways, i took my camera out and you will be able to see the light across the lake start acting crazy. after a while i noticed something in the sky that looked like a triangle inside of some kind of bubble jumping all over the place.  When i looked around i noticed another bright light in the sky to the left of this object that would get bright as well and when i filmed it, it was a circle with a bright light around the edge all the way around.  i knoticed the reflection in the lake start to get bigger and smaller and it was pitch black out.  i got closer to the lake and at first i thought the lake was being drained cause it looked like there were walk ways throughout the lake and sounded like there was something or someone in there.  i focused back on the reflection and thought i saw things heading into the light.  then when i looked back up at the spinning triangle i noticed what looked like a space ship rising straight up toward the spinning triangle, come to a complete stop for a few seconds and then precede toward the other bright light (with the light around the whole circle) and stop just under it.  when the sun came up i looked in the lake and all the grass on the inside of t! he lake was matted down like a crop circle would look. it was not like that the day before.  the grass looks really clean and like you would see on a golf course green but on the inside of the lake.  i also noticed what looked to be some kind of chemical on the surface that wasn’t there before either.Im not sure what any of this is or means but in the moment it felt like there was something being hidden in the lake and possibly some kind of moving objects going into the light but not coming back out. A transport of some kind maybe or just nothing at all. yesterday 8-27-17 we had a storm rolling through. i know clouds change shapes and all that but i don’t know if i was just seeing things or making my mind believe i was seeing things but i had the thought that there was things being trasported like machines, planes, sips etc behind these dark clouds. it looked like at one point some kind of sea creatures up there. again this could be nothing at all but would like some feedback on my first part of this email. Also feel free to share my youtube page and videos. thanks again.",Duration:4 hours,"Location: Ormond Beach, FL",Occurred : 8/21/2017 05:00  (Entered as : 08/21/2017 5:00),Posted: 9/5/2017,Reported: 8/28/2017 12:42:31 PM 12:42,Shape: Circle

220,"This is kind of crazy.  But I'll write the details and you decide. 10:30 on august 20th. 2017. Lone point, Lake Shelbyville.  Campsite 64.  My wife, daughter and son retire to bed.  Night before the eclipse.  My oldest son and I decided it was a cool night with a light breeze.  No bugs.  Stars were phenomenal.  We set up chairs facing west northwest.  Beautiful unobstructed view of the stars.  A hint of the Milky Way.  No clouds.  Fire dying out to glowing coals.  Sitting and talking about the Perseids we saw two weeks ago up in Wisconsin, hoping we could catch a few shooting stars.  We catch a few faint ones and then set up our iPhones on the Nightcap app.  Within the app there is a shooting star setting.  It takes a five second open aperture shot on loop.  It keeps clicking off shots until you stop it or it hits 290 shots.  Then it computes how many to save that had light events or movements.  You have to position your phone against a stable object to keep any stars from blurring.  It takes ok shots of meteors, but they stand out against the points of light that are planets and stars.  So my son and I are talking.  We start to see a few faint meteors followed by a few real fire balls.  A good show seeing 1 or 2 about every 20 minutes or so. Then we see the strangest thing.  A meteor shoot up from the horizon.  Never seen that before.  But figuring the earth is round, sure.  About three minutes later (the whole time the iPhone clicking away) we see a almost horizontal fireball shoot across the sky.  But instead of a straight trajectory it shoots in a strange curved almost ""u"" shape.  But instead of the common burn out on most meteors it just blinks out.  We give each other a high five excited we both saw it.  It was very bright.  High altitude.  Faster then anything I have ever seen in the night sky.  But unusual in its trajectory.  We talk about it.  Stay out till 1 am and collect our phones and go to bed.  As I'm laying in bed, I see I caught a series from one fireball.  I note the first three captures at 12:01.  Progressive fireball.Again.  There was no other light source near us to reflect anything.  This was all high altitude. And we never noticed the object.  However we were getting up and moving around and there were moments we were not staring at the sky.I tried zooming on the object.  Unable to identify.  And although it was pitch black except for the stars I can't explain it.  If you notice.  The stars in the background are crisp.  If it were an image of a blurred star all of the stars would be blurred.The biggest hangup was the speed at which the previous ""meteor"" was traveling, and its obvious altitude.  And how it traveled in almost a cursive u course.  How bright it was and the way its ""tail"" hung in the sky, as if it were almost drawn with a white glowing pen.I'm not sure we were meant to see this.I'm not even sure what it is.However, I do feel people fail to notice these things because they don't take the time to sit three hours staring at the sky.

I always search the skies to find the plane and watch its flight.At 0530 on Sunday 20 August 2017, I was out in the driveway smoking a cigarette.  I began to hear a low rumble, like an airplane getting closer.  It was a cloudless morning and stars were still visible, but I could not see an airplane anywhere in the sky.As the low rumble increased in volume, it sounded like it flew right overhead, but I still couldn’t see it.  Finally, as it crossed past the house (moving SW to NE), I saw two blinking red lights moving very slowly away from me.  I thought, “That’s why I couldn’t find a plane; it’s actually two planes”, because of the spacing of the two lights.However, as I continued to watch, I realized that it wasn’t two planes flying in formation, it was actually one extremely large craft, and it was flying extremely slowly, compared to the aircraft I normally see fly over the house.I assume that the blinking red lights were on the tips of its wings, but there was actually no discernible shape associated with the craft.  It was low enough that I should have been able to see wings and a fuselage, but there was nothing in between the lights that was visible at all.The low rumble gradually faded in volume, and as I continued to watch the red lights, they suddenly just disappeared, as did the rumbling noise.I am a former US Navy Sailor and a trained observer, having worked with the Navy police during my career.",Duration:3 minutes,"Location: White Plains, MD",Occurred : 8/20/2017 05:30  (Entered as : 08/20/17 05:30),Posted: 8/24/2017,Reported: 8/21/2017 4:30:46 AM 04:30,Shape: Unknown

The objects’ color never changed.I watched the objects break formation when they were directly overhead and begin moving in a somewhat straight line, as they gradually disappeared into the northwest sky.This part of the sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes.I then saw another of these objects traveling along the same flight path, approaching from the southeast sky, at which point, I ran inside my house to get my wife outside as a witness to what I was observing.We both watched this object through my binoculars as it headed in a straight line into the northwest sky.

238,"Strobe flashes from an intermittently blinking light in the northwest night skyUFO Report  August 19, 2017  7pm    While listening to Coast to Coast podcast on August 19th for the August 17th broadcast, my attention was arrested when you mentioned the Turkey sighting on August 12.  First, because my husband and I had traveled to Turkey in early 2016 for a tour of the early Christian churches.  The second reason the report grabbed my attention was because I think I saw a very similar flickering light around the same timeframe - only I live north east of Cincinnati, Ohio.My husband was out of town the nights of August 9th and 10th.  We usually stargaze together so I rarely go out without him but because the night was clear (not sure which of the two nights)  I stepped out onto the deck for a few moments to look up.  It was likely around 11pm as well… I knew I should have documented it because it was so odd, but not drastic enough to think it was report worthy.I was only going to take a quick look because being outside alone is a bit creepy but a bright flash similar to what the Turkish man described caught my eye.  This single flash was strobe-like in intensity and hit my peripheral vision.  My father, a naval photographer, taught me to look above a light in the night sky to see it better.  When I did that I located a slow blinking light in the North-West sky similar to the Turkish man.As I watched the slow blinking object, I discerned it was not moving much… maybe a tiny bit to the left. It definitely was not moving as fast as other objects my husband and I have seen.  Over the years multitudes of red blinking lights have been observed and sometimes are close enough to see a white or green light …we have assumed they are planes or drones… they are all silent. But this light, also silent, was different because of the strobe effect that happened one more time when I was about to turn away and go inside.Studying it again, I realized it was definitely not moving and so I began counting seconds between blinks.  Sometimes it was three seconds, other times it was five and once I counted seven seconds.  This was definitely an interesting phenomenon.  I wondered if it was a planet, star or meteor that was so far away the atmosphere may have obscured its light intermittently.It was notable enough for me to tell my husband when he returned home.  I wished he had witnessed it too because I was second-guessing the strobe effect that happened twice.  But when I heard the report from Turkey, I knew it wasn’t my imagination.  I suspect we saw the same thing… but probably on different nights.Thanks for your reports on Coast to Coast.  It’s interesting to hear what other people are seeing.My husband and I are age 55, college graduates and entrepreneurs.  We don’t believe in aliens from other planets.  We believe there are government black op programs and entities from other dimensions.  We have no desire to make contact with these entities, but recognize we  have authority over them through faith in Jesus Christ.  So no fear, worry or concerns… just reporting a curiosity in the night sky.

239,"Shiny metallic flying object carrying a second green triangle shaped objectAt 6:50 pm, my wife and I were in our backyard discussing Mexican food, when I looked up and saw at approximately 900-1000 feet high an odd looking object that was definitely not a plane or a helicopter and appeared to be carrying a triangle shaped second object.  The main object (don't know what else to call it) was very shiny and appeared to be metallic.  The top of the object resembled the shape of the letter S if it were faced backwards and seemed to have several strange cable like “arms” that were attached to and carrying the second object.  My wife also saw the object and also was in awe and not sure what top make of it.  We watched it travel in an awkward zig-zag pattern heading North-East as it gained altitude for about 2 minutes, until it was at a out of site.  Shortly after, an airplane flew overhead in the direction of the strange flying object. I took a  few pictures with my phone and a short video, which I will attach.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded, and sincere,  We suspect he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.

272,"bright red light moving turns green moves radically then goes out.Approximately 8:45 pm, August 16, 2017.  Location  Perkasie Pennsylvania. Location Shadywood village. I was sitting outside, enjoying the coolness of the evening with two other apartment dwellers.  By compass reading, I was looking 135 degrees to the south east above a small shopping center and the Bucks County Community College, upper campus, when I saw a very bright red light appear and moving in an easterly direction turned bright green and seem to stand still in the sky.  The light was a steady light.  Non-blinking.  It moved in front of a tree about 200 yd in front of me and was blocked for a moment.  Then still being green it slowly meandered on its seemingly easterly travel then made a upwards dart, via a straight line of travel.  Once again it turned red and it seemed to me to be moving more in a southerly direction.  It was at a low attitude so I thought but moved in a random zig zag for a short moment.  Then the light went out.  The lady's I was with seemed unimpr! essed but I know it had them going because it had me going and I was very vocal about it.  It was a very cool thing to have witnessed.  I did call the police but they showed little interest I recon they assume wackier old folks.  That's on them.

It was definitely not a meteor or asteroid because it moved in a straight line from south to north and never was there any fainting of the the solid light.

288,"Single intermittent flashing white light suddenly appears, traverses a small segment of the sky, then disappears.On 2 separate occasions now I have observed an unidentified flashing object in the night sky.  The first incident happened approximately 2 weeks before the date of this report, and this recent incident is what prompted me to file this report.The description of the object is as follows:  A single white flashing light that is similar to a standard aircraft landing light in size, shape, color, and intensity.  I often see standard aircraft in the area turn on their landing lights as they enter the airspace of the Austin and Georgetown area.  Their color, as was the color of this object, is different than the light of the stars, and they appear much larger than any of the larger stars, like Vega, or planets you can see, like Jupiter.The activity of the object is as follows:  The first incident appeared in the northwestern sky sometime after midnight around the first of August, 2017, as a white flash that I saw out of the corner of my eye, and that I initially thought was a standard aircraft.  However, when I looked in the area where I saw the light, I could see no standard aircraft marking or navigation lights, no strobes, and no shape of any aircraft.  I diverted my attention from the area, and then it appeared again, so I focused on the area and began to count to see if I could pick up some kind of regular interval.  After about 19 seconds, I saw the flash, and measured the distance it had traversed to be approximately 4 fingers/125 mils/7 degrees from the southwest to the northeast.  I continued to count, and the flash appeared again at 14 seconds, then at 16 seconds, and then seemed to lose intensity and disappear.  I was only able to observe this object flash approximately 4 to 5 times, and it traversed approximately 600 mils / 33 degrees! of sky before it simply disappeared.The second incident happened around 0030 and was similar to the first, however, it occurred in the northeastern part of the sky, was only visible for 4 flashes, and only traversed approximately 125 mils / 7 degrees of sky before it disappeared.The location of the object was as follows:  I observed these objects from Jarrell, TX, which is approximately 12 miles north of Georgetown, TX.  The first incident in the western sky appeared approximately 540 mils/30 degrees above the line of the horizon in a northeasterly direction.  The second, and most recent incident appeared in the eastern sky approximately 720 mils/40 degrees above the horizon in a eastern/northeastern direction.  The objects appeared and disappeared instantaneously, and could not be tracked from horizon to horizon, as can the standard aircraft that fly through the area.Final thoughts:  I would like to think it was a standard aircraft, but it exhibited none of the standard lights visible on most aircraft, nor could any shape or sound be identified, which is usually common, and the flight characteristics and intermittent use of light is completely out of character for any of the aircraft I observe operating in this area, or any rotary or fixed-wing aircraft I observed while serving as a jumpmaster for more than 10 years in the U.S. Army.  I simply don't know what it was that I observed, or why it behaved in that manner.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

305,"Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers.Following a similar sighting on the previous evening of Saturday, August 12, 2017, I accepted an invitation on Sunday, August 13, 2017, from a former pastor friend and his wife to have dinner and then go outside and watch the Perseid meteor showers before the moon rose.  After seeing a couple of very large ones, at about 10:00 PM the 3 of us witnessed a very similar repeat of the bright blue-white flash event at the same elevation and direction as I’d seen the previous night (as reported separately).  This was also followed by perhaps 6 or 7 less intense flashes at irregular intervals, but their location kept randomly shifting slightly to the left or up or down.  As the flashes became fainter, they moved slowly down and to the ESE for a considerable distance, finally becoming too faint to follow although by this time my pastor friend was tracking them with binoculars trying to see any detail (to no avail).  My friends then told me that they’d seen similar fl! ashes in the same location at about the same time the night before.Then, at around 11:30 PM there was a reoccurrence of the flash at exactly the same position in the sky and just as brightly, followed by a couple of irregular but fainter ones, all with no apparent change in position and this time not followed by the receding movement of fainter flashes.After solidly dismissing the idea of any sort of aircraft we speculated that it might be flashes from a reflective panel on a rotating satellite or space station.  But the irregularity of the flashes and the extreme brightness of the initial flash or two seemed to discount any sort of regular rotational cause.  It left us clueless but not at all alarmed, thinking it might just be some sort of optical illusion that would find explanation later.  But there was no mention of any similar sighting in Monday’s local newspaper.My companions have an amateur interest in astronomy and night sky viewing.

318,"Over the course of 15 seconds a shape appeared from nothing, became bright, and then dimmed to invisibility.I'm a 59-year old male pharmaceutical scientist, living just north of Indianapolis, Indiana.  My daughter is 20 years old and is a student at Ball State University, living at home this summer.  On Saturday August 12 we drove about 10 miles north of our house to get away away from city lights and watch the Perseid meteor shower.  We ended up in Rosston, on East 100 North about a mile east of US 421.  It's a gravel road.  We arrived about 10:30 pm and set up chairs on the south side of the road, facing north.Over the next 2 hours we saw about 2 dozen shooting stars.  At about 12:30 am (Sunday, August 13) I noticed a faint point of light to the north of us, about 60 degrees up from the northern horizon, traveling slowly south.  It was white and didn't blink.  I was watching it trying to think of what it might be when my daughter pointed it out to me, so she'd noticed it independently.  After watching it for another 20-30 seconds, a strange thing happened.  An image began to appear over it.  It went from invisible to brightly lit over the course of about 5 seconds, was at full brightness for about 5 seconds, and then faded back to invisibility over the course of about 5 seconds.  When I could no longer see the image, I could still see the faint dot which continued to travel slowly south.The image that appeared was shaped like a traditional 4-sided kite, but with the top and bottom truncated.  I could clearly see the left and right borders, but couldn't see a border on the top or bottom.  The left and right borders were brightly lit with white light along their edges, and the area between the borders was illuminated with white light, but not as brightly.  The light filling the area of the shape stayed within the area, it didn't appear to bleed beyond its imputed borders on the top or bottom.  The left and right sides were mirror images of each other, making this symmetrical and giving me the impression of an orderly structure to the object.  If you hold your hand out to arm's length and put your thumb and forefinger about half and inch apart, that's how big the image looked to me.My daughter saw it a little differently.  She also saw the object appear and get brighter, stay at maximum brightness, and then fade, and for the same length of time.  However, she didn't see the structure I did, which surprised me because I saw it clearly.  In addition, after the object was no longer visible and I'd just lost track of the faint white dot that started this story, she suddenly got agitated and started describing to me what she was seeing.  As she describes it, about 30 seconds after the lighted object had faded to nothingness and she was watching the faint white light, she saw a second dot of light suddenly appear next to it, and then saw 2 more dots suddenly appear above the first 2.  They then started undulating up and down, the upper row and lower row moving toward each other and then away from each other, but along a path that she described as part of an arc.  The movement wasn't vertical, it was angled.  She saw this for 15-20 seconds, and then they disa! ppeared.  As it was happening she was pointing to where she was looking as she described it, but I couldn't see it.We left just after that, mainly because this incident had scared her and she wanted to get out of there.",Duration:15 seconds,"Location: Rosston, IN",Occurred : 8/13/2017 00:30  (Entered as : 08/13/17 00:30),Posted: 8/17/2017,Reported: 8/16/2017 5:22:05 PM 17:22,Shape: Other

323,"White flashing light moving irregularly through sky.I witnessed a bright flash in the Northeastern sky, followed by a second bright flash a few seconds later.  I was watching for meteors directly above in the Milkyway, since it was a clear night.  The flash was so bright, I saw it out of the corner of my eye—a big ball of white light. It immediately grabbed my attention.  I traced the object across the sky for over 10 minutes.  It moved in an irregular pathway at an inconsistent speed, flashing at irregular intervals.  Sometimes it appeared to stay in one place for a few seconds.  Some flashes were very bright—brighter than a satellite or planet, some flashes were very faint, and many of the flashes were brighter than the stars and comparable with a planet or satellite.  All the flashes were white light and of varying durations, the longest being about half a second.  The flashing object moved in an unpredictable, zig-zag pathway across the sky, moving from the Northeast towards the West/Northwest.  After about 10 t! o 15 minutes, I lost it through the trees.The object had to be very high in the atmosphere, if not outside the Earth’s atmosphere.  At one point, I witnessed a jet airliner fly directly under the object as it flashed, so it was much higher than an airplane.  It made no noise that I could discern, but the heavy amounts of background noise could have drowned it out (diesel generators).  Its irregular speed and pathway rules out the possibility of it being an orbiting satellite or high flying aircraft.  No civilian aircraft or space craft could fly like that.  I do not believe it was any space debris falling back down to earth, as it would have left a trail and been a consistent glow.  I suppose it could have been some piece of highly-reflective material being tossed around in the upper atmosphere (but what and how did it get there?).  There’s no way it was a coincidental set of meteors.Something that is also possibly related.  Around 9:30 PM, my cat went completely nuts.  Chasing none existent beings around the room like she went crazy.  As soon as I opened the door to go outside and look for meteors, she abruptly burst outside and ran around the yard.  A few minutes after I had lost sight of the object, she ran up to the door perfectly normal again.I am a person of science, but I cannot logically explain what I saw to any degree of certainty.  The entire event freaked me out, along with two other co-witnesses.  None of my colleagues have believed my account of what I saw.

329,"several bright flashes in CincinnatiOn Saturday night, 08/12/17, my wife and I were standing outside of our home watching for the meteor shower.  We sadly did not see any meteors, but witnessed something else.  I caught a really bright white flash out of the corner of my eye first and directed my attention towards it.  It more or less blinked in and out of view several times. I  pointed it out to my wife whom was standing right next to me.  She didn't see it at first but finally saw it.  That was the first UFO that really had me scratching my head.  Mind you it was a beautiful night out very little cloud cover and stars all over.  After that initial sighting we observed probably 3 or 4 more in a span of about 5-10 minutes.  I initially thought it possibly have been a satellite or something.  They all just kinda flashed and disappeared and flashed again.  I was astounded as was my wife.  I really was hoping to find more reports of this because it was such a nice night and figured there would have been more people outside that night that may have seen them.  I thought they possibly could have been meteors, but, I have never seen a meteor act that way, usually they are more like a shooting star to the best of my knowledge.All in all it was very bizarre.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and neither could she.  Thanks for having this site.

331,"4 lights over Muskegeon Unity Fest.I was sitting with family & friends at the Unity Christian Music Festival on Saturday evening listening to music.  At one point towards the end of the concert, I was looking skyward due to the meteor shower that would be visible later in the night when I saw 4 faint lights moving together in a Northern direction.  3 formed a triangle & the 4th was to the right... after a few seconds, the lone light started moving in an erratic pattern, then would come back to the side of the triangle.At first I thought it could be a drone taking pictures of the festival, but once the erratic movements of the 4th light started, I knew I was seeing something odd.Shorty thereafter, at least 30 Chinese lanterns became visible several miles to the East, then within 5 minutes, a helicopter took off & circled over towards the lanterns.There were many things to see that evening in the sky, but the 4 lights I saw were quite odd.  They were about the same illumination & size of most of the stars that evening.  The sky was clear that night as well, which allowed for clear sight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

332,"My fiancé and I witnessed a solid red light, moving quickly through the sky, and stopping to hover at irregular intervals.  The red light was bright and steady–not flashing/blinking like normal aircraft lights.  During one of the stopped/hovering moments, a greenish light began to intermittently blink on and off somewhat similar to aircraft light but with a slower transition between on/off.During one of its hovers, the red light seemed to split into 2 red lights, at which point the green strobing light was turned off.  A plane passed by in the general vicinity, but above the light, and it seemed to react by suddenly dropping altitude very quickly.  Once the plane had passed, the 2nd red light disappeared/turned off and the green strobe resumed.  The light then drifted slowly in the sky momentarily and then accelerated towards downtown Norfolk at about the speed of a helicopter until it was out of sight.It could have possibly been a drone but the abnormal flight behavior, time of night, speed and distance covered made me skeptical of that.It’s hard to estimate the altitude of the light, however it was well below the clouds and normal flight paths of aircraft in the area.Our backgrounds:  I am a graphic designer, she is a medical professional at a local hospital.",Duration:~15 minutes,"Location: Norfolk, VA",Occurred : 8/12/2017 21:45  (Entered as : 08/12/17 21:45),Posted: 8/17/2017,Reported: 8/12/2017 10:36:48 PM 22:36,Shape: Light
333,"Brilliant white flashes of light in the sky observed by family of 5 in Middle TennesseeThe location is Walnut Grove, TN, which is just northeast of White House, TN, and approximately 30 miles north of Nashville.  The sky was mostly clear with a few stray clouds and contrails, with no thunderstorm activity within a hundred miles of the area.  At approximately 21:40 on 12 August, 2017, I observed a bright white flash of light in the north, northeast portion of the sky at approximately 45 degrees.    It appeared as if a star had flashed on and off and the size comparison of the light was the same if not marginally larger than a star.  As I continued to look in the sky I observed a couple of more flashes over the course of a minute, or so.  I walked back into the house and told my wife what I had seen.  I asked her and my 3 children to join me on the front porch to see if it continued and, if possible, to record and hypothesize what it could be.  At approximately 21:45 the light flashes had moved from the original point in the sky to nearly directly ov! erhead.  As we watched the flashes continued in intervals of several seconds.  A couple of the flashes appeared as strobes or camera flashes.  At one point a streak of light appeared in what I could only explain as a bluish white laser or fluorescent bulb in the sky in the same vicinity.  The entire event lasted only about six or seven minutes from start to finish.  My twelve year old tried to record our observations, but nothing of substance, other than our conversation about what we were seeing, was on the video.This is not the first time that I had observed an occurrence like this.  Approximately a year ago in the same general area and the same time of year, I saw what appeared as a star flashing on and off every few seconds.  A short time before this I saw a similar event take place on the southwest horizon from our property.  Researching several videos on the internet to find a reasonable explanation for what I had witnessed, here is what I found: 1.  	Iridium flare – While a solid hypothesis at first, upon reviewing videos online and reading the description of what it is and how this appears, this does not look at all like what we witnessed.  The flashes we witnessed were brighter, crisper, and strobed, while the iridium flare “warmed up and cooled down” over the course of a few seconds.  The lights we saw literally were like camera flashes.2.	  Air traffic – We witnessed several air craft traversing the sky while this was occurring, and since we are in the flight path of traffic in and out of Nashville International Airport, it was another good hypothesis.  However, the aircraft lighting, many of which are now LED, did not appear the same as the lights we saw nor did they have the same characteristics as the lights we observed.3.	  Lightning – There was no lightning in the area, and no thunderstorm activity.  The sky was mostly clear and mild with good visibility.4.  	Meteor – While this was the reason that I was outside watching the sky in the first place, this was not meteor activity.  The flashes were predictable and were easily distinguishable from meteors.As I continued to research other UFO reporting sites, I came across a few others who observed similar flashes.  These reports were from Michigan and Louisiana.  Interestingly, the location where we saw the lights is nearly at (within a thousand feet of) the line of totality for the upcoming eclipse.  Coincidence or not, this was very strange.  We are very curious to know what this was and to know if more saw the same thing.  Meanwhile, we will continue to watch the sky for more examples of this, and will report our findings.",Duration:7 minutes,"Location: Cottontown, TN",Occurred : 8/12/2017 21:40  (Entered as : 08/12/2017 21:40),Posted: 8/17/2017,Reported: 8/13/2017 7:53:53 PM 19:53,Shape: Flash

But 4 evenings later while driving I was listening to Coast to Coast and heard a mention of several similar accounts reported from the U.S. and Turkey, so will add our experiences (in two reports) to the mix.Around 2:00 AM on Saturday, August 12, 2017, I had just returned home to Grass Valley, CA, after a flight from Phoenix, AZ, and after unpacking the car went back outside to see if any of the Perseids might be visible.  There were very few but while looking NNE at around 3:00 AM there was an extremely bright blue-white flash about 35° up which lingered and faded for maybe a full second, followed quickly by another dimmer flash, and then a couple more that were even fainter, although not at regular intervals.  At first I assumed it was a plane, but it was stationary and there were definitely no colored running lights or associated sounds.  I’m familiar with helicopters doing nighttime searchlight operations, but the lights were just flashes with no downward beam.My background includes a lifetime amateur interest in the biological sciences, and later in the hard sciences (esp. quantum physics, astrophysics, cosmology, topology, etc.), but not UFO’s.

354,"Black Dish with small point on top between Las Vegas and Nellis AFB.Around 3PM to 3:15 PM on 8/11/2017, I was watching lightning from outside a casino in North Las Vegas.I noticed in the SW a tiny black dot slowly going upward a little to the left and right.  I thought it was a Mylar balloon that someone had let go of.Then it just stopped mid air, and then it started moving NE slowly just outside a storm cell I was watching.  It appeared to be entering just inside and outside of the Cloud Cell.As it got closer, it appeared to be just near Stratosphere Casino but much higher in the sky like ½ mile higher in the sky.  It was well defined at this point, black, flat on the bottom with a small point on the top center of it.At around Stratosphere Casino, it stopped again, and then started increasing speed, and in a matter of maybe 3 to 4 seconds, it went from Stratosphere Casino, to just left of Nellis AFB.  It looked like it was on a collision course with the mountains, when I lost sight of it as it went under my line of site as trees were to the East of me and the mountains.I heard no noise, no sonic booms, and did not hear any impact and did not see any visible signs of debris flying up as if it impacted something.From my vantage point, I can see Stratosphere to Nellis AFB, I guess that’s maybe what 25 miles between the two of them?  As it speeded up from virtually a stand still hover over Stratosphere to speeding out of site, it only took about 3 to 4 seconds travel that 20 to 25 miles, I know when the jets hit their burners, you see the thrusters flames and loud, like I said this was totally silent and no flames, just extremely fast and quick.It was traveling much faster than the fighter jets that pass by here every day.I was going to inquire to Nellis AFB if they caught a blimp on their radar site around 3 to 3:15 PM, but don’t know how to report it.

357,"OBJECTS TRACKING AND RESPONDING TO MY MOVEMENTS IN UTAH.I was driving from Denver to LA on the 11th.  It was 2:00 am in the morning in utah i believe around ST. GEORGE, I had been traveling about 80-85 mph.  While driving through a pass of high rocks, it cleared out and the canyons were on both sides of me.  While I looked to my right, i saw a white/red light hovering in the canyon, i was alone on my side going southbound, no cars around me and didn't think of anything of it.  about five mins later, i see three red/white lights to the right of me out of my passenger window.  The three objects were traveling the same speed as i was and hovering over the canyon.  At that moment i looked to my left and looked up and there were another two objects with the same red and white light higher in elevation but also tracking my movements.  At one point i had grabbed my led flash light to point towards the objects and one of the objects proceeded to move up and directly behind me, at that point that object had moved closer and i ! looked back and it had flashed a white light twice.  Then i grabbed my phone to try to take a video and it backed off.  This continued for about almost 40 mins while i was traveling at 80-85, didn't want to stop in the middle of the desert and continued to drive until i came up to this town i saw on my left side.  I could tell because there were a bunch of house lights and such.  At that moment i noticed  three lights in the shape of a triangle, the lights were at each point.  I could see a haze of sort and a ship and at the bottom right of the triangle it looked like a green beam was scanning a house.  AT that point i decided to slow down and see if what i was seeing was real.  I put my window down and all the objects following me stopped.  I decided to move my car really slow and they proceeded to follow.  At that point i decided to leave because i was on the road by myself.  I pulled off an exit to see if i could get a better look but no one was around so i decided to just leave.  The objects seemed like it was tracking and respond! ing to m y reaction.

360,"Multiple flashes of light of varying intensities and duration in random locations overhead(The first 4 seconds of the video are stars.)  I have an extensive aviation and aerospace background enough to know the differences in airborne craft and their flight peculiarities, if any. I was a pilot in the past.  I know all about Wright-Patterson as per Roswell, as my gramps used to work there in the 1950's-1980's.  I know what satellites and space junk in orbit look like, too.  This is not a spent Soviet rocket booster.I've seen this thing in multiple states since around 2012 at least.  It makes no sound.  This thing follows no linear path and has only one light that shines and/or flashes at irregular intervals at varying intensities.  The flashes look like fireflys as the flashes occur in random positions, but are much too bright, and I can tell they are way higher up than firefly altitude.Often, the light flashes bright-enough to rival Venus or Sirius, or perhaps even brighter.If it were a small, kit aircraft, it would have to be low enough to be able to hear, like around 5000' AGL.  If a small kit aircraft managed to get up to 14000' or higher, air would run thin. Maybe the pilot is on oxygen.  But at those altitudes the angular separation between each flash is far enough apart, that speed required to be in the following flash position would greatly exceed that of a single-engine prop.There is no reason why some pilot would be up above this country area in rural Ohio with no wingtip navigation (green/red) lights (against FAA regulations) flashing a single light in a strange manner.I thought it may be an experimental military craft, or some kind of exercise going on, as often when I see this thing, there is a commercial airliner nearby at cruising altitude (above 18000').  But I have seen these flashes with multiple witnesses who multiple times from coast to coast for about the last seven or eight years, often in parts of the country where there are no fireflys.I will edit a video of this, also. I suspect that I will be able to film them again soon. I am almost scared to admit to the general public that I believe I can see the flash and ""talk"" to it.  I will say ""can I see another, please?"" and it will flash brightly. I wait ten or fifteen seconds and I say ""gimmie another one!"" and it will flash again very brightly right after I ask. I sh*t you not. I am of very scientific mind and I don't generally believe in such a thing, so it is kind of concerning me that I seem to be able to request a flash, and then have it shine or flash very brightly.  It's kinda creeping me out.Like I said, I will try to do this more in the future.  This is the first time I have filmed it on hi-def or at all for that matter, and the first time I have ever had a camera good enough to even film anything at night, and I hope to improve my filming skills in the coming nights.I have seen it so many times over the years and made it flash by asking, that I am pretty sure I can get the same result again.  As I was filming this, I held the camera still as possible. I zoomed in 50% at some point about half-way through and left it there.  Only once did I quickly move it a few degrees to show an airliner as you can hear me say on the video.  I moved it back to the general vicinity.  So if you see a flash in the bottom right corner, for instance, and then one in the center, this is not due to me moving the camera.  The flashes actually occurred in separate spots relative to each other.Some flashes were quite faint, others were longer than a flash, increasing in brightness slowly over the course of a couple seconds, peaking in brightness, and then slowly dropping off.  Some moved when flashing slowly.  Others were stationary quick flashes.  The next flash would be very bright and quick, for instance.  Each flash was somewhat different.  When you hear me say, there's a bright one, the camera did not do it justice.  It was actually much brighter than the camera reveals.My guess is maybe a drone(s), or perhaps it is above the atmosphere (over 100km), which would make it huge, and fast.  I'm not sure of the altitude.  If I had to bet my life on it, I would guess between 20000'-50000' AGL maybe?  But it certainly could have been at orbital altitude, even. I'm not sure.Maybe it's a drone that can listen in through a cellphone, to explain why it flashes when I ask it to?  Maybe just some government employees messing with me, maybe? :D  I've been tricked before on more than one occasion by perspective regarding UFOs, so I believe I am more careful to discern this, these days.  I'm not saying it's ETs or anything, I'm saying I don't have a clue and I want to know.  I will search for similar sightings by others after typing this.

I would describe it as looking exactly like a lighthouse light rotating around.  I kept watching and it kept fading back in and out.  Sometimes it would be a sudden bright light turning on and off, but it was mostly like a lighthouse light rotating most of the time.  While I was under the brightly lit area I was unable to determine if it was moving or not, but it appeared to stay in the same spot as I walked.  I was able to get to a darker area where I could see the stars, and I watched it continue to rotate in and out of brightness, but it was becoming less frequent and less bright.  Then i noticed it was moving away slowly, and i eventually lost sight of it.  Some might say this is an iridium flare, but it kept on rotating for about five minute, and sometimes would just flash a single light.

379,"Round shaped craft with 4 lights spotted over water at Fort De Soto Campground; morphed shape into military grade looking plane.My friend and I were camping at Fort De Soto.  As we were sitting outside by the campfire, a strange mist started to fall (not quite rain, but definitely could be felt on the skin), we found it strange because there was not a cloud above us.  As we were looking towards the sky to try and find where this mist was coming from we noticed what initially looked to be a plane in the sky that had a strange flight pattern heading towards us.  It was too far away to see much so we thought that maybe it was a plane in distress.  We decided to run past the trees into a field to get a better unobstructed view of it.At this point it was probably two football fields distance away from us and about as high as a helicopter is when they are searching for people on the ground (it was quite low).  A few things became apparent as this was happening… 1.  Both my friend and I got goosebumps all over our bodies (including our cheeks) and the hairs on our bodies stood up at the exact same time. 2.  It was now close enough to see the shape and what jumped out at us first was that it was round in the front with a cigar shaped tail (definitely unlike any plane we'd ever seen before-it had no wings!) 3.  It had absolutely no sound coming from it other than a low hum, and 4.  It was blacker in color than the night sky.It had 4 round white lights around the front which quickly morphed into 1 bright center light and then morphed back into 4 individual lights, again.  It then made a sharp U-turn towards our left, went into some trees for about 5 seconds to where we couldn't see it, and came back out and over us again heading in the opposite direction, only now in an entirely different shape!  It was now in the shape of a 4 engine military looking plane (completely different from its original shape).  It proceeded to head in the opposite direction away from us and into the trees where we could no longer get a visual on it. About 30 seconds later the mist was completely gone.

388,"It seemed almost as if there was a car in the sky.My friend and I were swimming at night and having a good time, while my dad was on the steps of my back porch, trying to replace a step.  We were talking, being slightly loud.  I looked behind some trees, over a few houses and saw two extremely bright lights, in the shape of car headlights.  For a few seconds, I brushed it off as an airplane type I had never seen before.  I calmly pointed at the aircraft, telling my friend to look.  When she turned around, the aircraft suddenly started moving to the right.  Not like a normal plane, it wasn't at a steady pace.  It looked like a car that was breaking down, but it was level to where it was before.  Then it started moving faster and faster to the right.  I screamed and told my dad and friend to get inside.  My friend and I struggled to get out of the pool, but I kept my eyes on the aircraft.  It turned to the side, the lights then faced away from me, and went behind some trees.  Two other lights, seemingly on the a! ircraft appeared.  They were purple and green, much smaller and nowhere near as bright as the lights before.  I waited for the aircraft to come out from the other side of the trees, but it didn't.  I kept a close eye on it.  My dad calmed us down, and we went back into the pool.  Jets and planes fly over my house a lot, but this one had an unfamiliar route and was too close to the ground to be an airplane trying to land, there were no airports close enough.  Jets in my area have a square light  formation, of white, red, and sometimes yellowish lights.  Planes, however, with my airport, typically have red and/or blue lights.  Pretty much any lights besides green and purple.  Not to mention, the two brightest lights on planes typically are on the front, and are white.  Yes, that matched the discription, but how exactly did the plane remain still, and move to the right when it's front was facing us?  If it was a plane, the lights on it's front would've been facing us, so I understand why it would appear still, but that doesn't really explain why it moved sideways, with no hesitation or normal movement of any other planes.  Anyway, we were back in the pool.  Trying to have a good time, and ignore what we saw.  I kept a close eye on the spot between the trees the entire time.  I turned to talk to my friend, then spun back around and saw the lights again... in the exact same spot.  I screamed my friend's name as I rushed out of the pool.  The aircraft did the exact same thing once again.  When I was talking to my dad about it, who was trying to convince me it wasn't a UFO, for my good night sleep's sake, I pointed behind him and there it was again.  It then, moved to the right, and disappeared behind the trees.  I feel as if we were being spied on.  Every time I pointed at it, or started screaming, it left, then returned when I wasn't looking.

390,"My wife and I were watching the sun go down, facing west, on a cloudless evening.  I noticed a very bright, relatively spherical, light hovering in the same spot for about 5 to 8 minutes due west.  It is difficult to say exactly where it was hovering, because I have no idea how large it actually was, so perhaps somewhere between Adelanto and Lancaster.  It was not especially high in the sky, appearing just over the view of the homes across the street from us, no higher than an average helicopter height, but it did not move at all like a helicopter, nor did it have any sound.  If it had been a helicopter it would have been closer to where we sat based on the perspective of its position and relative size to the homes and we would have heard a sound, seen its lights and the manner that it moved.  It began to slowly change directions and altitude getting higher and heading north. As it did, the light extended out looking more like a rocket's contrail; however you could faintly see a dark elongated shape in front of the contrail.  It did not accelerate quickly or move in an exaggerated way, rather it steadily gained altitude, steadily moved in a north-easterly direction, and the contrail continued to elongate and stayed quite bright almost white.  In other words although it resembled a rocket's contrail it never had a fiery look.  As it reached a zenith height of what I estimate to be approximately 10 to 15 miles its contrail began to fade until it simply faded out and vanished.  There were no clouds to obscure it, no darkness to cover it, it simply disappeared, but slowly as if it were erased bit by bit.

399,"Single white light wit no sound observed moving west to east which seemed to grow in brightness the farther away it moved from observerOn the evening of August 7th, 2017, at approximately 9:30 pm, while out in my front yard, I was looking up, as we were expecting rain and I was checking to see if any rain clouds had moved in.  It was still clear with only a few wispy clouds scattered widely across the sky.  A,s I was looking up I noticed what at first appeared to be a star, about the brightness of Venus.  It was stationary in relation to the other stars, but, then began to move.  I knew it was moving as it closed the distance between itself and a stationary star in my field of view.  I'm familiar with aircraft, as I grew up on RCAF bases, and we are on the flight path of the airport in Winnipeg.  This light made no sound, had no other lights or beacons, and moved much slower than even a landing aircraft, and it was moving east in a straight line, not to the northwest, which would be the case if it was landing in Winnipeg.  I continued to watch it as it moved east gaining speed as it went, and the strange thing is it increased in brightness, the farther away from me it got,  almost as if it wanted to make sure I could follow its progress.

407,"Moving white light stopped in night sky.Tonight, the sky was pretty clear, there were no clouds, and about 20 stars were visible from my perspective (I was looking through the balcony of my building).I spotted what appeared to be a moving star, initially directly over me.  I like to watch stars and my region is usually cloudy, so I was trying to take in the view best as I could, thus why I was looking directly over me.The dot in the sky wasn’t moving in a perfectly straight line, but it was straight enough.  It moved towards the horizon in front of me.  I tried to show it to another person, but she couldn’t quite spot it (she wasn’t with her glasses).  I watched it move for a bit, until a saw a shooting star.I turned around to notify the people in the living room, and when I turned back, I couldn’t spot it back, but I can assure that it wouldn’t have reached the horizon, assuming it was maintaining a steady speed.Now, about the light:  It was warm white and steady, moving slightly faster than I imagine an airplane would.  It didn’t seem to blink in any other colors, such as the wings in an airplane tend to do.  Bear in mind that the sky was clear enough for me to observe the Doppler effect in the other stars.Furthermore, I’ve never seen an airplane fly that high in my neighborhood.  There are two airports in the city.  The first has very few flights coming off, and is mostly used for small, military training crafts during the day.  The second airport has recorded flights in the time of the sighting (around 9 p.m.) but usually, planes are lower than the dot was.When conversing to the aforementioned person, she said she had witnessed similar sightings in the city.((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station was not visible from Curitiba, on the date indicated by the witness.

I described the incident to the dispatch woman, and she said she would put it out there, and find out if any officers had witnessed it. To my surprise, after I made a voice recording of what I saw, there was a voicemail from t! he same dispatch woman!  She called to let me know that 2 state police officers had indeed witnessed the bright light, and didn't know what it was either!  Since the incident, I have recalled it over, and over all day today (it is still August 6).  I realize that it was a very big light, and a light that moved across the landscape and me in my car.

436,"Red lights moving southeast to the north, one made a 90 degree turn.This is the second time I have seen these lights in a 5 days.  The first sighting was on 7/31/17 at approximately the same time.  I will start with that sighting but, am using this date because it was the most recent.On the night of July 31, I went out and sat on the side steps of my house to have a cigarette, my steps face to the east.  The sky was clear and just beginning to get dark.  There were whispy clouds very high up and a light breeze from the south.  The moon and stars were visible.I looked to the southeast and noticed a very bright, dark, red, light coming from that direction.  I watched it cross the sky and it went behind a tree that is in my neighbor's yard that is about 25 ft. high. when it came out the other side of the tree, I could still see the red light and it headed off to the north.  When it was just about out of view, the light was no longer visible but, it looked at that time to be a very black cylindrical shape.  About a minute later, I saw another, and called for my brother to come out and look. It was  identical to the first.  He thought at first it was a plane but, there was no noise at all, no contrails and absolutely no sound.  The light was steady, not flashing.  It too moved on the exact path and looked to be a very black cylindrical shape as it went out of view.  About another minute passed and we saw another of these lights come from the same direction only it looked a little more pinkish red.  It, too, flew the same course and at about the same altitude which, I estimate to be about 1 to 2 thousand feet.  I am not good at distance so this may be incorrect.  As we watched, 4 more came, spaced about the same time apart. Some seemed to be further to the east and some coming closer to where they were almost directly overhead.  Most of them blinked out when they were parallel to us or when they had gone a little further north.  Since we could not see the red light  on the first two, as they went out of view,  it is possible that they turned if the lights were attached to some kind of craft,  or, they just blinked out. I got my video camera but, I was shaking and that video did not turn out well.  The lights through the camera looked orange instead of red but, to the naked eye, they were red. My brother thought they might be Chinese lanterns, fireworks but, they seemed too high and some flew faster and some slower.8/4/17--Again, I went out to have a cigarette before bed.  I happened to look to the southeast and was amazed to see the same lights as the previous sighting, again coming from the southeast.  This time, two came at once and the one that was furthest to the east all of a sudden made a 90 degree turn and went straight east.  I hollered for my brother but, he was upstairs and didn't hear me.  I continued to watch and witnessed 4 more of these lights, one flew almost directly overhead.  I got my video camera again and this time the video wasn't quite so shaky.  I tried to zoom in full but, it only caused the light to look like a diamond shape which, I know to be something with the camera and not the correct shape of the light.  These were identical in every way to the ones I had witnessed previously.  The conditions of the sky were the same also.  Again, there was no sound, no smoke like flares would have, no contrails, nothing. I could not see a shape to these, only  the very bright lights.  I have no idea what they were but, the one making the 90 degree turn to the east was what really made me wonder what it was that I saw.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Howard, SD",Occurred : 8/4/2017 21:15  (Entered as : 08/04/17 21:15),Posted: 8/11/2017,Reported: 8/5/2017 10:08:42 PM 22:08,Shape: Light

It struck me as odd right away, as it left behind a glowing trail; something similar to what an old CRT TV would do when you turned it off in a darkened room.  Then, within 3 to 4 seconds, a bright light flashed, just outside of where the streak that was left by the “falling star” had ended.  That’s when I realized this was not a falling star.  For the next 5 minutes I watched, as this object and possibly two others, flashed intermittently with varying intensity from very bright quick flashes of white, to a dull slowly growing intensity, culminating in bright white, then instantly dark.During this time, the objects started moving to the East very slowly.  There was no pattern or timing to the flashing or the intensity.  The light was mostly white, but there was a bluish tinge to it at times.

445,"Red orange, glowing egg shaped orbs hover in formation and fly away single file.I was watching television in my family room when I noticed some strange, bright red orange lights in the distance.  I went out on my patio to see what they were. I then saw four glowing somewhat egg shaped orbs move into a formation of two in a row over the other two and hover.  As I watched, another one began to rise from a little further west, and slowly move into the same area as the other four began to move away, in single file.  Several more followed suit, and there were probably at least ten of them in all.The objects made no noise, and the entire body of them glowed red orange.

446,"Jet-like roaring craft over Rhode Island...no true explanation from media.I am reporting a recent local event.  This event happened here in Rhode Island on the above date and time.  It was reported by local news channel WJAR, channel 10.  The 'event' centered around loud jet-like roars by craft flying at roof top height in Kent County, Rhode Island, and specifically West Warwick and Coventry.  Local residents were startled to hear these 'jets' flying low over their homes at night.  FAA regulations prohibit jets from flying that low...below radar, I would assume.  The concerned citizens were scared, understandably.  Several called in to WJAR news to report this event as it was occurring.    The report by WJAR Channel 10 on their website was as follows: residents called the news room.  The newsroom said they called 'the police' (vague), the police called the 'airport' (vague again)...we can assume Greene Airport in Warwick.  The 'police' were told by 'officials' (more vagueness), that the 'jets' were 'F-16s heading for Quonset Pt. National Guard airport and that 'concerned citizens' anxiety was put to rest.' (my paraphrase of actual words used).  That was the end of story.  Oddly, residents reportedly heard these loud low flying jets for a full 45 minutes..21:30 to 22:00.  If they were landing at Quonset Pt. why would they be flying around for 45 minutes in one area?  My curiosity was aroused.  Next morning, Friday, Aug. 4th, I called the Quonset Pt. airport and asked if F-16s or any jets landed at their facility last night....the woman who answered the phone said, 'negative.'  She was a bit nervous in answering my questions but my main question was answered.  I then called WJAR's newsroom.  A young man, who couldn't understand my question, gave the phone to an older man.  I asked him if he had checked the accuracy of their report about the 'jets.'  He stammered, then said, 'yes.'  I said, well I just called Quonset Pt. airport and no jets of any kind landed there.  So, it seems they did not check anything but just took for truth the report of the 'police.'  Was it state pol! ice, loc al police, airport police..he couldn't say.  This is another example of news reporting being dictated by state and federal officials for the sole purpose of allaying the fears of people who may suspect other things.  I told the news room guy to further check his contacts and find out more specifics.  He was very quiet as I explained how poorly their 'professional' reporting was.  He said he would further investigate and get back to me.  Of course, he didn't.  Who really knows what these so called 'jets' were.  Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one around with a brain who questions events in the news.  The main reason this particular event rang a bell with me is that several years ago a very similar event occurred in my southern part of Rhode Island, called Washington County.  This even occurred in January, about 2010.  At that time jet-like craft flew over my house at roof top level, displaying non traditional light patterns (flashing red and white lights), with a deep, bass roar (that sounded more 'broadcast' than from any internal engine) and doing impossible maneuvers (turning on a dime, stopping, bobbing up and down, etc.  This event occurred two nights in a row at exactly the same time...17:45.The craft I best viewed was on the second night.  It roared 75 feet over my house and displayed two huge round blood red lights on the underside of the fuselage.  The craft was either crescent or triangular in shape, though it was so dark that I could not be sure.  It was like they were imitating our jets.  No after burner was seen, which I feel it should have been.  The weirdest part was as this craft flew low to the east, toward the Bay and the open ocean, a bright ball of light, smaller than the craft, came out of nowhere to fly beside the craft, until the ball of light continued straight east and the 'craft' went SE, both toward the open ocean.  While this craft was flying overhead I called the local South Kingstown police dispatcher and held my cell phone up so he could here the deep bass roar of this thing overhead.  He asked me what it looked like..I told him it looked like a UFO.  He said, 'UFO?""...I'm calling the State Police', and hung up.  So many residents called the police and the WJAR news room that on the next night a report was on TV.  Again, I believe, a cover up, as the announcer, Dan Jahning, who still works there, nervously said the craft were 'just F-16s' flying to Hyannis (MA) airport.  Then he said, 'well, mystery solved' and showed a file photo of an F-16.  He quickly went on to the next news item.  I called Otis AFB in Mashpee, MA, near Hyannis, as Hyannis is a commercial airport on the Cape, the only airport capable of jet landings, and they said the F-16 is no longer in use and no jets landed there at that time!  Sound familiar?  More mysteriously, on the following Tuesday morning at 11:00, while I was with a cable TV installer outside, I hear the now familiar deep base roar that I heard the previous time...this time, to my amazement, an unmarked F-18 flies 100 feet over my house, flips on its side (so I could not see the cockpit), rights itself as it leaves, and roars off!  Oddly, a small Cessna type plane flies above it.  I get on the phone to the South Kingstown police again to report this.  This time, the dispatcher puts me a hold for a full four minutes, then comes back to me to say he can give me no information about this.  I asked him if this was being 'hushed up' by higher authorities, and he hesitantly said, 'yes.'  So, that was it.I called Senator Reeds' office here in RI about this and was told someone would 'get back to me,' but of course, didn't.  This type of event reporting and clamming up by officials goes on all over the US, I would suspect.  The reports on NUFORC are the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.  I would never have known about the West Warwick event had not so many local people called the WJAR newsroom (as happened here in my area before) and WJAR reporting this as a  poor excuse for sound journalism.  Can we blame the media?  Yes.  If they  had guts they would report the truth by investigation, but they just seem to be an arm of the  government.  As a private citizen I can only do so much.  News agencies have more reach but they have no guts.  These events will continue.  The  'Phoenix lights' of 1997 perhaps is a famous example of this.  Anyway, you can use this info as you wish,  Peter.

We are about half a mile from a boat launch on Lake Roosevelt.  My mom and I were watching tv at 23:55 or 11:55pm, when my step dad walks inside the house from the porch.  He says to my mom, “Come listen to this noise, I have never heard anything like it.”  So my mom goes outside with him on the porch.  I do not follow him at first because he was so calm.  Then my mom opens the door and frantically calls out to me, “Come out here as fast as you can!”  I run out to the porch and instantly see this long string of lights in the sky, and there is this loud, ominous, deep vibrating sound that I can feel vibrating though my feet on the deck.  The only way I would be able to describe this sound would be if there was a giant wine glass with a mile wide rim, and a wet finger continuously rubbing along the rim to make this deep low hum.The string of lights are white and flashing or pulsating in what appeared to be a sequence running around the perimeter of a disk.  We could not see the definite outline of the craft because it was dark and also very smoky from recent fires.  But we could tell by the pattern that the lights were moving that it was most likely a disk or ring shape.  The craft looked like it was about a mile long, and maybe 1,000 feet above lake Roosevelt.  We first saw the craft to the east, moving very very slowly.  Its path appeared to be following the curves of lake Roosevelt, headed north, then north west.  We could still hear the hum or vibration from the craft about three or four minutes after it was out of view.  I was in such shock that I could not stop crying my eyes out.  My mom tried to calm me down by reminding me that the day before this event, or maybe two days before, the local news station gave a statement from the local air force base, Fairchild Air Force Base, saying that people should expect to see strange aircraft maybe even foreign crafts.  But the broadcast was almost in a joking manner.  This changed my mood from scared and sad to scared and mad.

The area around the lights was totally blacked out, you could see no stars or the moon at all.  While I watched the object and lights, it did not appear to be moving.  If it was moving it appeared to be doing so very slowly.  The loud humming sound was definitely coming from the direction of the lights.  It was a very odd sound, not like an airplane.  The sound was more like a pulsing hum, but very loud.  In fact, you could feel the vibration from the sound.  After watching the object for a couple of minutes, I ran and got my Dad out of bed so he could see this as well.  My dad brought his cell phone with him so we could try to film this. I have uploaded that video to youtube.  My dad also was able to witness the object as well.  We watched this thing for another minute or two as it began to travel to the Northwest away from us.  We were able to see the lights still going in a clockwise sequence around the object until it faded out of our view.  The youtube video, which is too dark for me to see anything, is more of an audio clip, if the volume is up you can hear the hum though.

When I walked out side and went behind our shop I saw a ring of lights that appeared to go around this extremely large dark object,  The lights flashed one at a time and went around the object clockwise.  What really was amazing was the size, it seemed to take up a third of the western sky.  The other thing that we noticed was the noise it was producing,  It sounded like a steady thrum and was vibrating things around us.  It slowly moved of to the west and faded from sight.  The sky was fairly dark due to smoke from fire and the light was subdued from the smoke.  Stars were visible were the object wasn't but we were awed by the area it occupied.

We were near Yelm, a town on a prairie plateau in the South Puget Sound area, with a big sky view.The color was silver white, with a long bright white needle like tail much longer than I have ever seen with a meteor.  It had inside the small super bright oval shape a small faint green color to the core with a very short green tinting into the beginning of the tail.  The green was only by the object itself, it did not bleed into the tail more than about 5% of the overall length with its full tail.This is more conducive of a missile, than a meteor, in that its magnitude never changed.  The light was identical to the light of small missiles, such as patriot missiles, but much faster, and much longer.  As for the flare of missiles right at the front of the propulsion fire we couldn't see well, it was too far off, but it appeared to have a faint flare to it, not quite doubling it thickness at that point only, it didn't trail at all, almost like just a blur around the start of the burn area.This did not look at all like a meteor after initially seeing it, and it appeared to be about 40,000 to 70,000 alt., and if so, would put the speed about mach 10.  I flew flight test in Lear's, and I know what I saw.  It did not appear to change altitude in the least.Furthermore, EVERY meteor I have seen acted identically the same.

Although the sun had set, there was still plenty of light to see and the sky was still bright.  The object was an oval shape with dark edges and a center the color of the sky.  It was about at a height that I would expect a kite or flock of ducks.  So, at first we thought it was a smoke ring or flock of birds or a giant balloon.  However, as we drove closer, and it continued to move over us to the east, it became clearer that it was a very distinct disk or saucer.  Since we were right under it, the oval shape we saw in the distance had changed into a circular disk form.  Again the edges were clearly visible as a dark outline against the sky and the middle was now similar to a reflection of the sky, but more muddled and it included a swirl of feint lights.My wife and I were stunned in the front seats and I slowed the car down as there were no other cars immediately behind us.  As we passed underneath and it continued to move east, I accelerated and made a right turn on 82nd and into the immediate parking lot on the right side.

527,"Loud strange noise in the sky over Peachtree Corners, Georgia.This morning, Friday, July 28, 2017, around 11 am, I was sitting at my computer in my back bedroom.  I could hear this strange noise far off and I was wondering what it was.  At first, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but the sound was just so odd, I remain sitting as the sound became louder, I wanted to get up and go look out my sunroom window (like I usually do}, but for some reason, I just couldn't move!  As the noise got louder, I could tell that it was coming closer to my location and it was moving fast.  Finally I jumped up and ran into my living room and looked out my sunroom window, by the time I reached my window I could tell that it was passing over my apartments and moving fast.  Once I pulled back my blinds I notice that the sky was hazy and there were 2 Gwinnett County Police Officers facing in my direction and looking in the sky.  First, I was surprised because I had no idea that the Police was outside, and secondly I immediately notice them looking up in th! e sky with a shocked look on their faces.  They seems shocked and confused and one of them had his mouth open like WTH is that!!  I noticed that the noise had all of a sudden stopped and I could no longer hear it.  I tried to scan the limited amount of sky in my view and that's when I noticed how ""Hazy"" the sky was.  I watched the Police for a few minutes to see what they was going to do.  They both stayed focus on the sky and finally turn to one another and started talking, after a few more minutes of talking, one got into his car and left and went to another locations by the security gates.  The second Police officer stayed behind for a few more minutes, and then they both followed each other out the complex.  I have no idea what they were looking at, but I'm certain that whatever that weird loud noise was in the sky, they saw it!  No doubt in my mind because I can't forget the shocked look on their faces!!  After they left, I called my cousin, who had gone to Publix grocery store to see if he heard that strange LOUD noise because I cou!d tell that it was coming from that direction (141& Holcomb bridge) toward me (Holcomb bridge Rd toward Peachtree Corners).  He immediately said that they could hear it, but no one knew what it was!!  There is a lot of strange objects in the sky in the Peachtree Corners area, on any day at any time you can witness them.  I noticed that if you have sunglasses on, you will be able to see them clearly,  I have taken my sunglasses off and I could barely see them, but once I put them back on, I can plainly see them.  They do disappear, which makes it hard to capture them on video or take pics.  I don't worry too much because I know I will see them again because they are ALWAYS flying around.  I was able to capture one on video on July 10, however this particular object has been around for years so I wasn't too concern about getting the video but I decided to take it anyway before it disappeared because it will disappear on you and reappear somewhere else.",Duration:3 minutes,"Location: Norcross, GA",Occurred : 7/28/2017 11:00  (Entered as : 07/28/2017 11:00),Posted: 8/4/2017,Reported: 7/28/2017 11:13:05 AM 11:13,Shape: Unknown

542,"White crescent 'disc' seen mid-day in cloudless sky.Not quite sure what to make of this, but here goes...I was taking a little break from work (I work from home) in the afternoon, sitting in my backyard enjoying the sun and watching the dragonflies.  We live about 5 miles north of Gibsons, BC, in a rural area on the shores of Howe Sound. The sky was completely cloudless, gorgeous blue, with only a sliver of the rising crescent moon in the western sky.  I was sitting in a lawn chair, watching the dragonflies, and observing a small dual prop plane traverse the standard flight path to YVR behind where I was sitting (northwest to southeast).  I glanced back at the crescent moon to my left, when I noticed a strange moving 'object' to the right, in the sky above the house between two trees. Hard to tell the altitude, but it seemed to be minimum of airliner cruising altitude (30K feet-ish), but really hard to tell.  What it looked like was this: imagine the crescent moon, flattened out as if it was a disc on the horizontal plane, with the reflected curved surface facing towards the sun, and the other half, like the moon in daylight, not really visible.  It was moving at a speed normally seen with passenger planes, but it definitely wasn't a passenger plane (WAY too big... and not the right shape). No sound at all (whic! h is why it surprised me, outside of the way it looked), and the large curved shape just didn't fit.  Wasn't a contrail either (not that I've ever seen a 'curved' contrail like that from an airliner, but I did ponder that possibility...  it's the only other thing that MIGHT look like that, in very strange circumstances I can't quite even imagine).I called my son (he was in the house) and hopped out of the chair to run to the front of the building to catch another glimpse of it, as it had gone 'behind' the big tree in our front yard so I couldn't see it from the back any longer.  And of course, it was no longer visible.  Sadly, I didn't have my phone with me to take a photo - though I don't think I would have been quick enough to catch it anyway.So strange. Never seen anything like that before.  We're pretty observant (I love planes and helicopters, so always looking skyward) and I saw interesting lights one night over Pemberton, BC, a number of years ago, but I've never witnessed anything like what I saw last week.

My significant other and I decided to pull off onto a county road and park.  To our surprise this light stopped above the tree line when we parked and we continued to watch it for over 4 hours.  Along with this light being the biggest we noticed over 10 star like lights coming around the pera meter  of this big stopped light.  These little lights were almost exactly like fireflies they ignited light and dimmed off and lit up and dimmed off.  (I'm 100 percent they were not actually fireflies!)  We watched this huge light stay above the treeline until the sun came up, when it seemed to slowly get higher and higher until you the sky was as light out as this unidentified flying light.  To describe this light I'm more detail it was yellow and pink in color and had a green light to the lower right of it.  It seemed to dance and or habe a flow to it.  It reminded me of a jellyfish.

546,"Glowing lights behind cloud hovered, then moved in similar directions at a high rate.  Return to original position.I was driving North on the 429 heading to Orlando at 2:16 AM, when I saw 5 lights in a straight line shining through the clouds.  They were as big as the moon, but I could not see any objects because they were shining behind clouds.  They were spaced equally, one object being able to fill the gap between the other.  I figured they were spotlights from Disney, but I realized Disney was behind me and there was nothing else that would shine spotlights at 2 AM.  I kept an eye on them, but they suddenly zoomed out as fast as a meteorite travels across the sky.  I couldn't see where they went the first time as I was driving.A few moments later they zoomed back to their original formation. I put my hazards on and pulled off the road.  I tried getting it on video, but it was too dark.  They traveled in a straight line, but in slightly different angles so they were spaced evenly, but farther separated from each other when I looked behind me.  I sat there watching them for about 10 minutes, but they finally zoomed out of view and never came back.  They zoomed out and in probably 2 times in a span of 5 minutes.  They mostly hovered.  They disappeared for about a few minutes, but they came back and zoomed in and out for maybe another 2 or 3 times in a period of 5 minutes.

I said to myself, 'what the hell is that?'  I continued slowly driving, trying to see if the light/object moved at all, but it did not.  No sound was heard and no other smaller lights were visible on the 'craft.'  It reminded my of the usual artist conception of the star of Bethlehem, as depicted on Christmas cards.  I lost sight of it behind the trees on my left, as I drove on.  I wanted to get to a large farm up the road that offered a clear view of the sky.  When I got there, about 3 minutes later, I could see no light at all anywhere.  Way off, I could see a stationary light in the sky, but it could have been light from a plane.

580,"Multiple Flashing lights moving in the sky.On July 25th, 2017, at approximately 2:20am, I went out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette. I went to the far end of the deck which faces east.  As I looked toward the tree line I noticed a strange multicolored light.  I was intrigued by the light so I continued to look at it.  I soon realized that the light was moving erratically.  Unsure I continued to watch. It began to move well above the tree line still moving up, down, side to side, and even in circular motions.I was awe struck, and knew no one would believe what I was seeing, so I went and woke my niece.  She witnessed the object, but went back to bed.  I was too captivated to stop watching.Not long after I seen the first object, I noticed that there was another moving light in the sky.  Both moving in the same manner with the same red, green, and white flashing lights.  Before long I had spotted five of these objects.  None of which could have been of natural occurrence.Around 4:18am one of these strange lights appeared just  on the other side of the tree line.  This one seemed very close.  It's light was a steady white, and it's movement was the same as the other objects.  It appeared so close that I went inside and grabbed a flashlight.  I could be mistaken, but it seemed as though the light would respond to the blinking of the flash light.At one point I counted as many as 11 of these lights, two of which seemed to inspect passing airplanes by approaching them closely.Something else that was strange during this event was that I witnessed what I believe to have been a total of nine meteors, but given what I witnessed and the way these lights would appear, I am unsure if they were meteors, or the objects joining the others.I am certain that someone else had to see the near, low flying, object I mentioned, because it hoovered above a state highway just behind our home.  It was too low, bright, and moving in such a manner to be mistaken for a star, and I could hear morning work traffic on the highway.This is true and accurate as I can tell it.

Something was a little different this time.  What I first thought were landing lights were not.  It was the glow of the craft itself that I saw.  I looked for flashing beacon lights on the wings but there were none.  In fact, I could now tell there were no wings.  It was a simple orb.  It was traveling east northeast.  It was headed in the direction of DIA.As I continued to watch, it made a gentle turn to the southeast.  That is when I realized it was silent.  I said to myself ""What am I watching?""  As it moved away from me, I was completely convinced that this was not a plane.  If it were a plane and with it past me now the landing lights would no longer be visible.

As we tried to sleep, we heard a few more thunders around the Drummond North area.  Then, suddenly, we heard a loud sound and the intensity of that sound was increasing and decreasing periodically with a time period of 2 or 3 seconds.  Our ears were able to detect that periodic nature of the sound.  Then a bright orange beam of light entered our room through a window.  The intensity of that orange light became brighter and darker in synchronization with ups and downs of the loudness of the sound.  As this event was unfolding, we both thought that lightning might have started fire at a power transformer somewhere.  So, I asked my wife to call 911, and I ran to the window.After removing the curtain of a window, I saw that a cylindrical structure hanging between our house and a neighbor’s house at a height of about 40 to 50 feet above my window.  The approximate size of that cylindrical structure could be about 5 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter.  That structure was generating both the sound and the light beams, and their intensities were modulated synchronously.  The sound had the characteristics of running a huge blower whose speed was changing periodically in a very controlled manner.  The light was so intense that at its peak value that I was getting blinded by it.  Our backward was lighted up as if the sun’s rays on a clear midday have become orange and pulsing.As I tried to look directly at that cylindrical surface, I could only see some window-like features on that structure when the light intensity was low.  The beam of light was practically coming from all over the structure.  Instead of calling 911, my wife was so puzzled by the event that she unknowingly ran to another window and witnessed that bewildering event. Suddenly, the whole thing stopped.  That cylindrical structure just disappeared in front of my eyes, and the world around us appeared to be the same as before.  Approximately, whole event took probably between 15 to 20 seconds to unfold.I realized later that while that event was progressing, not a single dog barked in our area. We do not have a dog, but all of our neighbors do, and their dogs will bark even if a moderately loud car enters our area at night.

604,"Two fast moving green and silver orbs pass over Tulsa, Oklahoma.I am a 52-year-old researcher/data collection specialist.  I was sitting with my 78-year-old mother and 13 year old son on our back porch.I was looking to the southeast and two green glowing orbs appeared from behind a neighbor’s roofline.  From my prospective, they appeared to be glowing green orbs with a barely noticeable silver edge around one edge of the green glowing circle; as if a sliver of the side of the object was observable.  The silver part seemed solid like it was metal.It is clear that they were several miles away.  They were also very high up.  It was a hot hazy day with hazy clouds high in the sky.  The objects were clearly observed being obscured by the clouds at times.  The two orbs stayed the same distance from each other throughout the observation.  They moved much quicker than an airplane but the movement was steady; not jerking around like perhaps a laser pointer might look.The orbs were heading towards us and the closer they got, the more obvious the details became.  It also was more obvious that the objects were very high up.  Once overhead, my perception was that they were not very big, maybe the size of a car.  At no time did we hear any sound coming from them.A middle aged couple was out for a walk and noticed my family looking at the sky.  They turned around and I asked them to look for the lights.  They saw them too.  We all stood and watched the lights move quickly but steadily towards us and over the house until we could not see them anymore.

615,"Green illuminated &quot;v&quot; shape seen above Montreal, Quebec, CanadaHello.  I would like to report an unusual sight in the skies above Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the night of 22 July 2017.At approximately 10:15pm, three of us were on the 9th floor common roof-deck of a high-rise condo complex.  We were there to observe fireworks in the downtown area; these fireworks were, as it happened, low on the horizon and occluded by other buildings.  The sky was generally clear, with a few long & wide “contrail-like” clouds present.After a few minutes of watching the skyline, etc., we looked directly overhead and saw the following phenomena.  We saw a grouping  of small white cloudlets within an elliptical patch of sky, whose long dimension was approximately equivalent to 5” held at arm’s length.  Within that grouping was an illuminated “v” shape, about ½” at arm’s length in extent, with the arms of the “v” consisting of a number of bright “pinpoint” emerald green lights, each surrounded by small halos.  The shape and distribution of lights (which appeared quite definitely organized or “non-random” to us) remained stationary, as far as we could tell.A we watched the “v” shape, we saw it gradually fade away.  Then, to one side of its location, but also within the elliptical patch of white cloudlets, we noticed a faint white line, extremely linear and precise, and stationary in the sky, with an extent of about 1” at arm’s length.  This white line, and the surrounding patch of cloudlets, then faded entirely from view; that is to say, it did not disperse or drift away.The duration of this sighting was approximately 45 seconds.At various times before and after the sighting, we noticed low light-aircraft above Montreal; in addition, a rotating searchlight/beacon was operating from one of the downtown highrises.  Regardless, the phenomenon we observed bore no relationship to these other light sources, nor to the distant fireworks.  And incidentally, we noticed that smoke from the low fireworks simply drifted with the wind, and did not fade out.Lastly, one of us (me) waited for clouds to drift into the area directly overhead, where we’d seen the phenomena, to see if some local ground-based illumination might have been the culprit; but I saw nothing of the sort.For whatever it’s worth, I myself am a PhD physicist (particle physics), 58 years of age.((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and he seems to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.

616,"I witnessed two ball like objects possibly observing a platoon live fire training exsercice in Poland.On the night of July 22nd, 2017, around 2215 hours, I was a gunner on a .50 Cal machine gun on a Stryker armored vehicle, supporting a platoon live fire training event on a Polish military range just outside Bemowo Piskie.  We had pull off to the side of one of the roads leading into the range waiting for a call to provide support.  What happened next, I cannot explain. While adjusting my night time optics which consisted of a PSQ-20 mono style helmet mounted thermal and night vision device, a ball like light appeared in the night vision setting currently set on my optic.  The object appeared just atop the tree line possibly 700 meters to my exact front, however since my optic only covers one eye my depth proception was off and an exact distance is very hard to gauge.  The ball appeared to what could have been maybe 10 feet across and the light it was giving off in my night vision optics was blinding.  But despite all this, that’s not the strange part.  What got me was that when I closed my optic aided eye to look with my unaided eye, this object was completely invisible against the clear night sky.  I was baffled that I couldn’t see this bright light that had just blinded me with my naked eye and looked through my optic again.  The object was still there but the intensity of the light had dimmed.  It hovered in the break of the tree line for about 90 seconds before it began to descend to the left slowly.  Now when all this was going on I had simply figured that this was just an infrared flare on a parachute fired from one of the mortar teams that were training that same night.  But when the ball of light finally dipped below the tree line and faded out of site, a second object of the same description appeared in the same break in the trees.  At this point I flipped my optics over to their thermal setting and observed.  The object was ball shaped again and was bright red hot in my thermals.  I changed over to night vison again.  Once again, the object was blinding bright.  And when I closed my optic covered eye to observe with my unaided eye, the object couldn’t be see.	When IR motors are fired they go up and release their flare at about a thousand feet and begin to float down to earth.  However, while these flares are meant to give off intense illumination viewable through night vison they also have a dull red visible light that can be seen with the naked eye simply for the purposes of being able to track where the flare is drifting.	The objects I was witnessing gave off no visible light, nor did I hear any mortars being fired.  And trust me even if the mortar is a distance away, they a very audible.  The now second ball of light seem to follow the same flight path as the first object that I had seen.  It hovered in place for about 90 second in place.  I felt like it was watching me, observing my weapons and my armored vehicle.  After 90 seconds, it began to descend down to the left just as the first.  Then it vanished.  “It must have been a flare” I thought to myself.  It was gone for only a moment when from behind the trees it rose directly up, not violently, but by no means was it slow.  This was the moment I knew that it was not man made.  Once again it hovered above the tree line.  It had to have been watching all the military activity in the area.  Without warning like when the first object appeared its brightness in my night vison increased dramatically.  To a point where it felt like someone was shining an IR l! aser in my night vison.  Then after the intense brightness it vanished.  I would only see the one object leave I cannot account for what happened to the other object I witnessed.	I’ve served as a scout in the army for over three years now.  One of the fundamentals of reconnaissance is to report all information rapidly and accurately.  When all this was going on, I took note of my surroundings.  There was no disruption to my equipment and radios, my weapons were functioning and in good shape.  The surrounding wild life wasn’t disturbed and other than wracked nerves I felt ok.  I decided to keep quiet about my entire experience.  How could I explain to my Sergant that I had witnessed multiple objects only visible to thermals and the IR spectrum but was invisible to the naked eye.  I’m charged with several million dollars of government equipment and weapons, they would have lost confidence in me.  This is why I’m reporting this to you.

619,"Unusually bright light moving across the sky.At appx 9:47pm CDT, I was outside on our east facing porch, just watching for satellites and meteors, as I like to do on weekend nights like the one that night:  no clouds and no moon.  I was scanning the sky, when I saw an exceptionally bright light in the SSW sky appx 40 degrees above the horizon.  This light was as much as a magnitude brighter than the planet Venus at that planet's brightest.  This light was moving to the NE and likely took 2-3 minutes to cross from the point of first sighting until it crossed the whole of the sky before disappearing behind some trees to my ENE.  I then moved to another part of the yard and was able to watch the light past the trees until it was lost to sight on the far ENE horizon.  I believe that it passed to the north of both Antares, and then Saturn, but to the east of Altair.  I don't believe that it got any higher than maybe 50 degrees above the horizon, maybe less.  The light was silent the entire time.  The light was solid the e! ntire time, neither blinking nor dimming.  I say it was solid to say that it did not blink or waver.  But it was so bright that it caused it to be more of a Venus-like glare, rather than a simple point of light.  It only dimmed as any light does as it moved farther away into the distance.In a single sentence it was as if Venus was moving across the sky.Over the years I have seen dozens if not hundreds of satellites.  I have seen many that seem to appear from nowhere and become very bright before quickly dimming to nothing.  In the moments just after spotting this light and seeing that it was not blinking (like an airplane) I assumed that it must be a satellite and expected it to very soon dim.  It never did to any extent.  I also felt that it was moving erratically, slowing then speeding up and wavering very slightly from side to side.  I say this because it was what I felt I was seeing.  I can NOT say that I am certain it was acting oddly. Realizing that this was like nothing I had seen before I went to the door and asked my wife to come outside. She agreed that it was much brighter than what we had seen before. Without my prodding she said that it seemed to be moving in the same odd manner that I have described.Another point I want to make is that we live appx 7-8 miles NE of Tulsa International Airport and see many low flying aircraft near our home either just after takeoff or turning west toward a landing.  Just as my wife was coming to the door, I began hearing sounds of an airplane, and started to feel that was the explanation.  But when I looked up I saw the airplane lights moving from the S to N but beginning a turn to the west that would take it behind our house towards the airport flight lanes.  The bright light in question was already well to the east. When the plane was lost to sight the sound went away.  Again I did not hear any sound that I would associate with the passing light.  There is a National Guard Center about 5-6 miles to our south and they house a number of military helicopters.  I have seen them flying in the area many times.  Later, I considered that if this were a helicopter, for its lights to have been that bright, it would have to be flying rather low, and I would certainly have heard that familiar chop chop sound.My wife and I also considered the idea that it could have been a drone of some kind.  I don't know much about them but will say that other than the possible side to side waver I was feeling, this light traveled in a very straight line from one end of the flight to when it disappeared on the far horizon.To me this was an object that I could not identify with any certainty and since it was moving, flying in the sky it was a UFO.  I EXPECT that you will determine that it was indeed likely a satellite.  I expect that you have satellite information at your disposal and you will end this mystery quickly.((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of ISS, which was visible at 21:45 hrs..

622,"Mental contact made with ufo but with a negative  responseHello.  This is a p.s. to what I wrote to you on the 16th.  On the 22nd I saw two of the same craft that I saw on the 16th.  They were one minute apart.  They were both white and traveling in a straight line.  They were rectangular shaped but with a curved top and bottom.  I decided again to make mental contact with it.  The first craft was just like the one on the 16th. I stared at it while it was moving and directed this one thought at it, ""what are you""?  It just kept slowly moving and didn't disappear.  A second one soon showed up.  It was flying just like the others, it made no noise, no exhaust and had no wings and flew very slow. I sent another thought at it ""what are you"".  Then I watched it fly out of sight.  I then went inside my home and my sight was now strange.  When I looked at anything of a light color, my eyes began to flicker-On and off very fast.  It was light that I saw whenever I looked a light colored object.  This lasted for six minutes, then stopped.  I'll never try to make mental contact with a unidentified object again.

634,"Twinkling amber lights in formationMy fiancé and I were traveling home in my vehicle after grocery shopping.  He suddenly said, ""Look up!"" as he leaned forward over the steering wheel.  When I leaned forward and looked up I saw what I estimated to be a dozen or so twinkling/blinking/phasing objects flying in a close V-formation.  He pulled over immediately, and I turned on my phone's camera to record video. (Due to technical error on my part, I missed recording most of the sighting.)  Initially, they were overhead.  I had difficulty understanding what I was seeing, as the twinkling was disorienting, especially that if one blinked out completely, it might reappear elsewhere suddenly.  They did not maintain formation for very long, due to the leap-frog-like blinking in and out.  (The objects both twinkled and blinked out completely.)  The color of the lights/ objects was a light amber color.  There was no sound beyond traffic (we were near an interstate on-ramp).  The shape was basically spherical. The twinkling sometimes gave the hint of an egg-shape, but I believe that to be an optical illusion.I witnessed the objects seeming to disappear and reappear from the V-formation, some of them failing to reappear.  They were moving from the western suburbs of Birmingham toward the city of Birmingham.  Eventually, the lights were either too far away to see or they had just disappeared.  I was able to get a fairly poor quality video (33 seconds of one or two of them in the distance) that demonstrates the ""twinkling.""  Sometimes the lights moved toward their destination before blinking out.  That's how I was able to comprehend they were reappearing elsewhere after they blinked out.My fiancé said he did not see as many ibjects as I did.  He saw about half as many, but he was driving in traffic, and I was completely focused on the sighting from the moment he pointed out lights in the sky.The objects were flying far too close together to be any manned craft of which I am aware.  Initially, I had assumed it was military exercise, then I thought it was helicopters.  Logically, it could not have been helicopters.  Not only was the light-color wrong for any aircraft I've seen, but - beyond Blue Angels, I've never seen aircraft fly so closely in formation.The number of lights dwindled to two, then one, and I lost sight.  I didn't get the impression that they were moving especially fast, but I don't know how low they were flying.  I had an overwhelming sense of disorientation which certainly contributed to guessing at their altitude.  They flew over radio towers, but before I saw that, I would have said they were flying very low overhead.To be clear, it was dark and I saw no physical objects beyond the lights.  I have spoken about them assuming that the twinkling was somehow a part of a physical object.  I can't conceive of how the twinkling wouldn't be attatched to a physical object of some sort.",Duration:2-3 minutes,"Location: Birmingham (outside Hueytown), AL",Occurred : 7/20/2017 21:48  (Entered as : 07/20/17 21:48),Posted: 8/17/2017,Reported: 8/11/2017 10:19:43 AM 10:19,Shape: Formation

651,"Spotted black hovering UFO of unusual/hard to distinguish shape near parking lot, before flying away at high speed.This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began. I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.  I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft’s direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer.I knew very quickly it wasn’t a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.  I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.  But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn’t somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.  I can’t say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark – basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.  I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.  I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.  At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system. I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.  I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.  It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.  When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.  As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.  Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it.The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft.There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

683,"My wife and I saw what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over a field in Eugene, Oregon.On July 17, 2017, at approximately 7:00 PM Pacific Time, my wife and I were driving South on Lorane Hwy in Eugene, OR.  As we passed the Andrew Reasoner Wildlife Preserve, we observed to the North what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over the hill, approximately one quarter mile from our position on the road, and maybe 500 feet off the ground.  My wife noticed it first and exclaimed, “Look at that.  That’s not moving at all.”  My wife was convinced it was tethered to the ground, like a dirigible.  As the driver, I was initially focused on the road, but was able to turn my head left and see the plane for about 15 seconds and it did not appear to be moving.  I tried to convince myself that it was, just flying very slowly, but I saw nothing to indicate it was changing position.  The plane was extremely low; from our vantage point, we could almost see the tops of the wing surface and we could easily see the color scheme on the side of the plane (a flash of orange writing on a white fuselage).  Considering the Eugene airport is miles away to the North, and the plane was traveling, or hanging, East to West, I find no rational explanation as to why a giant commercial jetliner would be frozen, or possibly moving at a speed slower than our car.  Although I’m relaying this as if we cognized everything immediately, it wasn’t until we rounded the next corner and the “plane” left our sight that we realized how incredibly odd what we had just witnessed was.  We immediately turned the car around and were back where we first saw the plane in less than 30 seconds.  It was gone and although we had a clear view all the way to the horizon--West, North and South--we could find no trace of the “plane” in our view.  We couldn’t see clearly to the East, but it would have been impossible for the plane to head in that direction from the position it was in when it left our view and no chance we wouldn’t have seen it if it was even possible for it to instantaneously turn around.  Considering the proximity of the “plane” to our car, we should have heard the sounds of the plane's engines, but there was only the noise of our tires on the road.  The plane made no sound and didn’t show any exhaust gases.  We both are well- familiar with the area and have never seen a commercial airliner flying so low, let alone at walking speed, if not completely frozen.

Unfortunately, they weren't.However, while scanning the night sky around 9:45 PM, I noticed a light directly overhead.  At first, I thought it was a satellite moving quietly, steadily due north.  But then I saw it was blinking on-and-off in one second intervals.  No navigation lights were evident, and the light was not the strobe of a high-flying aircraft.  In fact, two such high-flying jets (headed west) crossed well in front of this object, so it was easy to discern and compare what a strobe looked like at altitude vis-a-vis the unknown object.In terms of illumination, the object/light resembled Saturn in both brightness and magnitude, although the quality of its light was a steady pale white while lit.  There light definitely wasn't a flash like that of a strobe, and it wasn't like the brilliant reflected light of a planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  It had no star-like characteristics, either.Unlike transient satellite flashes, the pulsing remained constant throughout the sighting.  And, unlike a satellite, the object appeared to stop about 30 degrees above the horizon for 15-20 seconds, before heading off in a more northwest direction (a deviation under 10 degrees).  It pulsed steadily until it disappeared from view.

This did not look like anything I had EVER seen in the sky before...and I was at first concerned it was something dangerous.  After it continued past us, I was less concerned, and just very curious at what it was.The lights did not make any sound that we could hear...and the night was overall quite quiet.  The lights continued on their path, coming in and out of the clouds in a southern direction, for about 6 minutes or so...as they faded out of view and into the clouds in the distance.Hard to get a good read on their altitude, but they were significantly higher than the relatively low clouds that night, and perhaps a fair bit higher.  If I had to guess, I would say 5,000 - 15,000 feet.  But again, I'm no expert at altitude distances.Unfortunately, both of our phones were charging in the other room, and by the time we thought to get pictures, the lights were out of sight.To describe the lights in more detail:  Seven (maybe 8) very bright, white lights, maybe 10 times brighter (or more) than the brightest star in the sky, traveling in a nearly straight-line formation across the sky.  They were traveling in a nearly single-file line, with a couple of the lights slightly out of line.The lights were very close together -- all 7 seven of the lights were approximately contained in the outline of my fist when my arm was completely outstretched.

730,"Black S shaped spinning balloon hovers at noon, then takes off at a 45 degree angle back up into space within seconds afterOn July 14, 2017, at 12:15pm, I was walking west on South Bartlett St. in Kingston, Ontario, when I notice a black S shaped balloon, spinning aerodynamically a mile up in the sky, and a mile south east of me as though it was flat on the ground..I happen to be beside three guys work near a moving van and asked them to look up at the strange black thing in the sky.  They all stared with me for 30 seconds and I asked what they thought it was.  One guy said, ""It's probably a drone..  Or probably not ""with a puzzled look.  The other two said they thought it was strange.  I said its maybe a kite and continued walking to the corner, but kept watching the object.As I came to the corner, a tree blocked my view, but as I was able to see it again past the tree, I was shocked to see that it had projected itself in the trajectory of my eyesight and itself approximately 50-100 miles away and on a 45 degree angle that went straight towards space.I tried to grab my camera but didn't want to take my eye off it, and within 5 seconds, it was so tiny that it disappeared into the sky at a steady, but rapid speed.  I went back to the truck and asked the three guys if they had continued watching it after I left and they said no.I speculated it was like the object sensed it was noticed by me and took off when the guys stopped looking and when my vision was blocked by the tree I had passed.I am a average working man and haven't seen anything my whole life except for now two sightings ( including this one) in the last two years and I just turned 40.  Strange thing is I had just left my friends house after telling him a theory about how we as humans are the top predators and think zombies are scary, but if we had a new predator, an alien one, that we would find whatever shape the alien was to be horrifying and our instincts would change to fear the sight of them and that we would become uncivilized and not be able to be in groups, as we would be easily targeted by this new predator that we don't even know exsists yet.  For some reason I think such a horrible race of ""monsters"" exsists in space just waiting forsure numbers to get to a certain point like they have for generations.  Waiting till the earth is full of humans than coming down and harvesting us all spare a few to re- colonize.

I initially noticed one circular bright light in the sky swooping down over a field then back into the sky at a high rate of speed.  As I noticed the light coming back around repeating the the same motion, I was closer to the object than before.  As I noticed the object swoop down almost touching the field only one light was on, then a second, and then a third circular light appeared.  Each light was evenly spaced in a straight line.  As this was happening, I turned my head out the window and looked back as the object was ascending back up toward the sky.  With the lights pointing up I was able to see the shape of this object.The shape of this object resembled a large rectangular wing similar to a wing on an old time wwII plane.  The side of this object opposite of the three lights had the middle part of this wing purtrud out in the center of the wing like a tab.  So that side was not completely straight,   The other side with the lights was straight with three large white circular lights in a row.I attempted while watching this to take a picture but was unable to while driving.

Elevation is about 7,500 ft, and 100 miles from any big towns, so I get to see a lot of the night sky.  While I was in the back yard of the drilling rig, I looked up and noticed a star-like figure, which hadn't been there the last 14 nights.  I started really looking closely at the object, and noticed it changing colors...red, blue, white.  I instantly thought, well, maybe it's a plane or drone, but seemed to high of altitude, considering the mountains around me were 11,000 ft higher then the horizon. I called my co-worker on the CB radio, and said hey check this out.  And he responded ""what""  I jokingly said, the UFO in the sky.  He also brushed it off as a plane, or some commercial aircraft, until it didn't move like any plane.  We then began radio chatter which got a few other employees attention as well and they came to the back of the drilling rig to see what all the UFO talk was about.  As we talked, we came to the conclusion maybe it was some kind of satellite.  We also had a debate about maybe being some kind of planet in our solar system, but that would explain the size and color changing orb that it was.  So I went about my work day ever now and then I glanced at it and it stayed in the sky until 5:30 am, when the sun came up.  I got off work around 7:00am, and started my travel back home heading to Casper, WY.  through he south pass of the mountain, and saw some pretty out of the ordinary traffic.  At least 20 white cargo vans all following each other, heading towards the area we had seen the UFO.  4 of the vans had trailers, 2 black enclosed trailers, and the other two had flat bed bumper pull trailers with telescopes. I then thought to my self, well maybe it was some kinda of planet, or some kind of star searching club was going to check the night sky out.  Finally reaching my house in Casper, Wyoming, slept the day away, because I was working nights for the past 14 days.  I then told my girl friend what crazy things I saw at work and the way home.  She kinda gave me a look like that's crazy, or maybe your crazy.  But we stepped foot outside our house and seen 3 star like orbs again flashing in the night sky.

748,"Low silent object with multiple blinking lights followed by bright light over field	Last night, at around 10:15PM, my boyfriend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. We were sitting in a golf cart on the driveway talking.  He looked over at me, and saw lights behind my head that weren’t like normal plane lights.  When he pointed it out, I turned and looked. What I saw next is hard to explain.	The object that was moving in the sky was very large, and no more than 500 feet in the air, and it was silent.  A normal plane, at that height, would have been so loud.  We were in an open driveway, in a middle of a field, so the night was quiet.  We would have heard it if it was a normal plane. This object was so low, and moving slowly.  When we noticed planes in the sky later, they seemed to be moving so fast compared to how slowly this object had been moving.	The lights themselves were so different from anything I’ve ever seen before.  The object looked like a triangle shape, but the sky was dark as I’m assuming the object was as well. But on each side, in the  middle, there were blinking lights.  They were blinking both red and white.  We watched as this object turned, and as it changed direction I saw more lights.  Either on the bottom or top of the object there was also a circular pattern of lights, that seemed to be rotating.  There were at least 10 lights all together, if not more.	We watched for about 5 minutes as this object made its way overhead before disappearing above the tree line.  My boyfriend and I were talking, and I was trying to reason with him logically.  We’re in Carlisle, PA.  There are plenty of military bases around.  Carlisle is a huge shipping port. Etc, etc.  Then we stood up to go inside.  As we got out of the golf cart and turned to enter the house, we saw a light so bright just hovering then, above the field.	At this point, I almost couldn’t move.  This light also was maybe 500 feet in the air.  It hovered in one spot, but not completely still.  It seemed to almost dance in the sky.  It was only one light I could see. But it was so bright, it had beams coming off of it, almost like it looked like a pinwheel.  It was so bright, it made everything else feel dark.  I couldn’t even see the tree line in the distance.  It didn’t fly away, it didn’t do anything.	That is when my boyfriend grabbed my arm and pulled me in the house.  He was scared and wanted to go inside, but I couldn’t look away.  This experience lasted only maybe 2 minutes in its entirety before I made it into the house.  But once I got inside I realized more.  This light was also silent, and for how close and bright it was, it would have had to have been making a noise.  Even small drones you can hear in the air.  But this was completely silent.	We went to tell his brother and friends, and when we told them it had just had happened, they ran outside to see if it was still there.  Within 5 minutes, by the time we had made it back outside, this light was gone and there were no traces of it.  When we walked back outside, the sky was brighter and back to normal.  It seemed almost like a different atmosphere outside.	This also, is happening at a time when a lot of strange things have been happening to me.  I have RH- blood, and joke about being an alien pretty frequently.  But, I’ve recently been waking up with strange bruises that are very small (less than half an inch) in diameter, and are in a straight line.

It looked like a star but extremely bright, yet the sun had not set yet.  I was shocked it was so bright.  Then it started to move down, to us it seemed as though it was moving slowly, but it appeared to be quite far away so it could've been quickly.  As it moved downward it faded slowly until it completely disappeared.  There were no clouds in the area for it to disappear into.  We watched it until it got so dim we could no longer see it.  I yelled for my husband and by the time he came outside it was too dim for him to see.  We stayed out there about another 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, my husband was yelling, ""Holy crap there it is!!!""  I looked up in the same spot and sure enough there it was.  So extremely bright and fading as it slowly moved downward.

It flew for about .5 km before disappearing.  From the time of the first flash to the time it disappeared was about 3-5 seconds.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))I was thinking the same thing.  It seemed to have landed near or in Brantley Lake.  Because of the lights not covering the entire area of its surface and it being visible between flash and skid I'm uncertain what it was.

The sky is clear and sunny, visibilty is very good.  I am in the drivers seat.  Our speed, and other traffic, is 80 mph.  Earlier I had seen a sign ""Speed Monitored By Aerial Surveillence,"" so I was watching.  To the southwest, my left, through the front windshield, I saw a helicopter.  It was a white, familiar-looking police helicopter, hovering at an altitude that appeared normal for police traffic helicopters, and less than a 1/4 mile south off the Interstate.  Mountains rise up about 10 miles ahead, and I could see a small white airplane in the distance, banking to my left.  I looked at the helicopter, and noticed a long straight black tubular object (1) (the top surface reflecting the sun) above it, at approximately twice the altitude of the helicopter.  I comment to my wife, ""What do you think that is?""  My first thought was a large solar balloon.  The tubular object appeared to be more than twice as long as the helicopter and about the same diameter as the cabin of the helicopter.  The black tubular object was not a rigid cylinder and would fold to form a V shape, both arms about the same length.  At one point, I saw (2) one of the arms fold again about 1/4 of the length from the end.  By now, I am looking directly out of the drivers side window, due south.  A second white helicopter has appeared, and both helicopters maintain their altitude beneath the object.  The three aircraft do not appear to be moving away, but hovering.  The white airplane that I saw earlier, is now in view, south of the Interstate and at some distance beyond the helicopters and appears flying a circular path around the object, as I can see some top surface of the wings.  Moving past the event, I see the tubular object straighten out briefly and then refold (3) into a V.  It's still south of the Interstate, behind us and then lost to my view.  I was in the passenger's seat.  When my husband called my attention to the object, it was south of us, and I looked out of the driver's side window (I had already noticed one helicopter), I first thought it was a small flock of birds flying closely together.  When I realized it wasn't birds, I paid more attention.  It looked like (4) a translucent object floating without form, sort of like a jellyfish, but it had some kind of black large pieces to it that I took to be the birds originally.

778,"Two star-like objects preceding and following one larger tumbling or spinning object, similar in size to airlinerWe always sit on our back deck and watch the skies for aircraft but this night was different. It was not yet dusk, skies were clear with no cloud cover.  I saw what I thought was an airplane but something didn’t look right. It was either spinning or tumbling as it was moving.  As soon as I saw this I said to my wife, “This doesn’t look good-something is wrong,” thinking it was a plane in trouble and going to crash.  But the object kept on moving in the same trajectory, not losing altitude.That’s when it got weird because as I was watching, two star-like objects appeared around the larger object. While what I saw was in the distance-like an airliner at high cruising altitude- this larger object was as large if not larger in size than a jet plane.  The two smaller objects were like moving or shooting stars only they maintained a consistent altitude, never falling.  They did at times pull closer to the main larger object.The objects came from south of us and travelled north east until they reached a position pretty much in front of us.  It is a guess that the objects were approximately 50 degrees above the plane of the ground.  At that time they appeared to stop in midair, but in hindsight we think they may have changed direction heading east away from us until they disappeared from sight--smaller objects first, then the largest was last to fade away.  This all happened fast and they travelled at a speed similar to that of an airliner.We live within 15 miles of Bradley Airport and watch planes on approach all the time.  But this was different because these objects travelled away from the airport’s location.  What we found odd was that all during the time we watched, there were no other visible aircraft.

The time was around 21:00 hours EDT on the date of 7/08/2017.  As I walked generally towards the west, I saw a dark, round object silhouetted against the still bright western sky.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above the tree line at a heading of WNW from my location. It was motionless and emitted no lights or sound.  It also appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall but was generally spherical in shape.  It seemed to be about the size of one of my fingernails, held at arm’s length, from my perspective.The first thought that came to mind was that I was observing a large tethered balloon some unknown distance away.  I also considered a kite but quickly dismissed that idea as there was barely a breeze and certainly not enough wind to keep a kite aloft.  I continued to walk westerly as I observed the object for about 10-20 seconds before the tree line obscured my view.  In that time, the object did not appear to move at all, but remained completely stationary.  I continued to walk to the end of the street and turned northerly at an intersection.

In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day.Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead.Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant.Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I've had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I've also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.  Lately, I'd say within the last year, I've seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.  I have been ""spiritually probed"" several times, mostly in the back of my head - cerebellum, but also in the navel and unfortunately my fudge tunnel a time or two. I'm not psychotic or mental, I've never done drugs, and rarely consume alcohol.",Duration:90 minutes,"Location: Columbus, OH",Occurred : 7/8/2017 01:30  (Entered as : 07/08/2017 01:30),Posted: 7/23/2017,Reported: 7/8/2017 6:31:56 PM 18:31,Shape: Unknown

It was a very cloudy evening, and the sun was going down, but it was still bright.  Our kids (ages 19 and 11) started yelling to look at the UFO moving through the clouds!  The entire sky was cloud covered, so my husband, my mother and I had trouble finding it.  At first I thought the kids were just messing with me because they know I believe in UFO’s and no one else in the car did, so I didn’t look.  However, the panic and excitement in their voices along with the frantic pointing made me think this might not be a joke.   Due to the amount of heavy cloud cover, I was still unable to see it.  They took the cell phone and made a clear live picture of it moving very quickly in a straight line.  I have to say, when we looked at it, you can clearly see a perfectly round sphere moving quickly through the clouds just as they said.  Other than its shape being a perfect sphere, the color was odd.  It was the same color as clouds but slightly lighter.  Not metallic, not white, almost translucent.  That along with the perfect round shape and the fast movement made it visible against the back drop of the darker blue cloud.  It could have easily gone unnoticed if you were not looking in its direction.  This was not an airplane.  My husband, the complete skeptic said, “I don’t know what it was, but I know it wasn’t a plane.

841,"Bright orange light slowly moves soundlessly over northeast Fort Wayne, IN.On July 5, 2017, at approx 11:15 PM, in a northeastern suburb of the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, there was a very large, bright, orange light moving in an arc in the night sky from the southeast to west.  The object was visible for about 2 minutes.  The object was at least cloud level or above, as it either became slowly obscured by clouds or gradually diminished.  The speed during the observation was roughly that of a typical traffic helicopter, but the object was not a helicopter.  It made absolutely no sound.For comparison, moments afterwards, an airplane was observed moving in a southwesterly direction.  It was at a much higher altitude, loud, and easily identifiable through the spotty breaks in the cloud cover.The observers were a middle-aged husband and wife.

843,"Very bright white light following a southern trajectory seen 5 minutes prior to Falcon-9 launch from Cape CanaveralI was heading out to my front porch, here in East Orlando, about 5 minutes prior to a Space-X Falcon-9 launch of the Intelsat 35e.  I am about 37-miles west of the Space X complex at Cape Canaveral, and can see the rockets quite clearly when they launch.  As I went out the door, facing east, I noticed a very bright light to the northeast rising upward, about a third of the way off the horizon, initially almost exactly the same speed and curved trajectory a rocket launch would follow to the southeast.  I was upset because I thought I had missed the initial launch.  I tried to shoot a digital movie of the bright light, but it did not come out as far as I can see.  I visually followed the light as it climbed and got smaller and smaller, finally vanishing at high altitude.  I was puzzled because the light was an intense white color, and usually rockets at low altitude display a bright orange flame, as I was thinking I had been watching the Falcon-9 launch, and I’ve seen many launches from the Cape over the last 10-years, and what I thought was the launch just didn’t add up.  A few minutes later, a 7:37 pm (1937 hours) I saw the bright orange flame of the Falcon-9 booster appear just to the southwest, as it climbed and started to leave a contrail as it went into the upper atmosphere.  What really puzzled me, is that I had the impression that the bright light seen a few minutes earlier had been moving a whole lot faster than the rocket after it gained some altitude, I’d say about 4-times faster.  I know they prohibit aircraft in the immediate launch area, and the bright light flew directly through it only a few minutes prior to the actual launch.  I thought maybe an Air Force jet had left the skid strip on afterburner or something, but I was in the Air Force and never saw an afterburner as bright as that.  It was odd, because I really thought I had been watching the launch, and only after I saw the actual launch did I find the whole episode strange.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Orlando, FL",Occurred : 7/5/2017 19:32  (Entered as : 07/05/17 19:32),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 7/5/2017 6:52:21 PM 18:52,Shape: Light
844,"Chevron shaped object hovering and also slow moving, very high, over San FranciscoWe (2 adults and a toddler) saw a sparkle shimmering in the sky from our balcony at home. At first glance it appeared like a very high airplane shimmering in the sun but it stayed still.  Though still, it did move very very slowly from the west to the east.  It stayed there hovering or slow moving at least 15 minutes.  It would shimmer, flash light and then disappear, then re-appear within seconds.  I went to get a camera with a 500 ml zoom lens and took some photos.  After downloading to my computer, I zoomed in further.  The object is boomerang shaped and it rotates around.  Sometimes in had red, orange and yellow colors, other times it had green and yellow.  Possibly this is from the rainbow spectrum of light bouncing off of it.  Otherwise it looks metallic, silver.  The sky was clear blue, no clouds.  There was no sound.  We saw an airplane pass by during this sighting and it made a typical noise, but otherwise the object did not have any sound.

I had polarized sunglasses on and I don't know if that made a difference, as I kept them on.The thing I saw first was the most visible.  It was a triangular shaped object that moved through the clouds it was just behind, very quickly, and it was darker than the blue sky that was coming through the clouds.  When it had gone past the cloud formation it disappeared.  It was not visible against the blue sky, just the clouds.I continued to watch the clouds and another triangle sped past in the same direction, heading approx. north to south.  Again, it was not visible in the blue sky, just behind and across the scattered clouds.  Both sightings lasted less than 3 or 4 seconds and there was no sound of aircraft noted.  This is a very quiet part of the Olympic, though we do have Navy Growlers and occasional jets and light aircraft fly over.  None were noted at this time.These were high clouds and the objects had to be pretty large.

After I was standing there for a couple of minutes, a dark shadow in the sky caught my attention.

I felt very cold and my body was shaking uncontrollably, and my left arm was also raised up at the elbow and my hand was waving.  There was some kind of light surrounding myself and the Alien, I can not remember how I left the alien ship.  When I came back to full memory the ship was about 200 feet in the air.  I went back inside my home and I laid down, then suddenly the door closed and the clock rang.

851,"Bright orange flickering object observed for 90 seconds flying North to South over Portland, Oregon.I observed a very strange flying object on July 5th at 1235am (I was so awe struck by the encounter, I immediately noted the time) over Portland, Oregon.  The object appeared to be heading in a general North to South direction and it followed, as far as I can tell, a linear path.  I originally took note of it because it was very bright.  The light was orange in color, looking like a planet might in the early evening sky, though it was even brighter and was about twice the size of what a planet would look like.  The light flickered.  I first spotted it at about 30 degrees above the Northern horizon.  I thought it was odd because it was so bright.  At first I wondered why a plane or helicopter would have such a bright orange light on at that altitude.  I live close to a level 1 trauma center so at first I thought that it might be a life flight helicopter flying to the hospital.  I’ve seen them with their landing/illumination lights on and they can be quite bright.  I couldn't hear a sound and I never did. I continued to watch it, trying to figure out what it was.  As it got closer, I thought I could see a red navigation light.  However, as the object moved overhead and to the west of me, the red light that I thought was a navigation light appeared to actually be a red shaft of light extending downwards from the bottom of the glowing object. I thought this was really odd.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  It was strange enough to get the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. After the object had passed over my head (maximum height was about 75 degrees), at which point the object was very bright, the object rapidly began to get fainter and fainter until it looked similar to what a satellite would look like flying across the night sky.  Then it faded out and disappeared 35-40 degrees above the Southern horizon.  Total time of the viewing was between 60-90 seconds.  It was by far the most bizarre thing I have ever seen and I can't for the life of me figure out what it was or even surmise what it may have been.  Although I was positive what I had seen was not the ISS, just to check I looked up if the space station was going to make a pass over Portland that night, and I discovered it would be visible over Portland at 4:38am—almost 4 hours after my sighting.  I have seen the ISS a number of times and this was much brighter.

860,"UFO sighting in Yreka, California, during 4th of July fireworks display.  (07/04/2017)	Last night (07/04/2017) at exactly 9:51 p.m., myself and four of my friends witnessed a UFO sighting in the southern sky south of Yreka, California, during the fireworks display.At first, it was thought to be a high-flying jet liner, but then it stopped and didn’t move. It was a neon green object that appeared to be round, but was to far away to discern its exact shape.  After watching it for a minute or two, it began to make unnatural maneuvers un-like anything any of us had ever seen before (Quick turns, and reversals of direction), then came back to its former spot and was stationary.  It made these sorts of maneuvers three times during the fireworks display.After the last maneuver, the object changed color, from green, to white and red.  It was about the size of the largest visible star, and seemed to be flying in the upper atmosphere at about a 45-degree angle from where we stood.  We commented to each other that it was probably watching the fireworks displays in Yreka and Lake Siskiyou (a lake immediately west of Mt. Shasta).About 30 seconds after the Grand Finale (10:10 p.m.) the object turned a bright red.  It began moving slowly in a northwestward direction and we lost view of it as it passed behind a tree.  Emerging from the other side of the tree, the glowing red object began to pick up speed, and made an abrupt turn westward.  It then darted from that position (still about a 45-degree angle), and in about two or three seconds disappeared over the mountains on the horizon.  This occurred about 10:12 p.m.It was too fast and too high in the atmosphere to have been a drone.  When it sped west over the horizon, it was at super-sonic speed, yet did not have a tail, or light trail behind it like meteors have.I contribute this in hopes that others may also have saw it, and captured it on their cell-phone cam.  It was so distracting, we paid more attention to it than we did the fireworks show. If it caught our attention that much, others must have surely witnessed it also.

866,"Red-orange orb, changes shape vertically into glowing teardropAfter viewing fireworks set off from a boat in the middle of Premium Millpond, and after the sched New Rochelle Fireworks show ended, which we were able to view from a distance,  The sky was clear.  There was a lot of air traffic (planes and helicopters) due to airports nearby towards the city on and off throughout the night, but the sky was clear, very dark a the time my fiance' and I saw a glowing red light moving very slowly towards our direction (coming from the south) over the trees I believe had to five island park.  As it got closer we noticed that there were no other lights, just a red circular round glowing orb, the outline of it was red and the inside was more of an orangish red color.  As it moved  even closer it started changing shape, by ""stretching""?

868,"Two hovering objects with red and deep turqouise-blue light(s); blue was pulsatingOn July 4, 2017, at 22:23 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time), in Butte Montana, to the south at over 2000 feet elevation (the mountains one mile to the east rise 2000 feet above my location and the object seemed at  least that high) I saw an unknown object, I’ll call it object #1.  It appeared as two distinct lights: pulsating blue-turquoise light on its left, and constant red light to the right.The object appeared to be hovering and not moving much.  The object was in about the same location as another type of object I saw a few minutes earlier (see my other report).  I watched #1 for a while and then I saw another object that looked exactly the same in the West;  I’ll refer to it as object #2.  The #2 was about the same altitude as #1.  Then realizing it is something unusual with two of the same objects, I went inside to get my binoculars and iPad.  Both #1 and #2 were hovering and visible when I went inside.While inside, #1 disappeared.  Using binoculars, I took a closer look at #2 and could see not two lights but a string of 4 round red lights to the right and below the blue lights.  The blue lights were 3 or 4 and round as well and only the blue were pulsating.  The lights were parallel to each other (blue on top red on bottom) but they were not perpendicular to the ground.  They were higher to the right and lower to the left when viewed.  Also the blue lights were not directly above the red but offset a little to the left:  Blue Blue Blue Blue Red  Red Red Red.  The lights were very distinct or solid and not at all like aircraft lights.  I am a few miles north of the airport, but there were no airplane or helicopter sounds, and the objects I saw were relatively motionless.I proceeded to take a photo followed by a 4 minute plus video of #2 on my iPad.  The photo and video are not at all as clear as I could see with the naked eye.  However, when I zoom on the photo, I can see the 4 red lights in a row as I described.  The photo didn’t capture the blue light which must have been “off” in the pulsating cycle.  On the video, the pulsating lights seem more white than the deep turquoise blue I experienced.Many people in the area were setting off their personal Fourth of July fireworks as seen in the video.  However, #2 hovers over the spectacle below.  After four minutes or so, I quit taking video and after 10 minutes from the first sighting of #1, #2 descended slowly out of view behind some trees.Shortly before I saw #1, and immediately after # 2 disappeared, I saw 3 other objects of a different type and will report the sighting of those in a separate report.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be unusually serious-minded and sincere.

876,"While watching Murrells Inlet Fireworks, I watched a number of lights positioned at various points surrounding me, and changing position, color, and apparent shape frequently.  Some remained fairly stationary, retaining their magenta/red hue, seemingly drifting up, down, and sideways un-eventfully, yet maintaining their brightness.  Others would blink on, grow brighter, and race from position to position, moving what I estimate to be about a mile in seconds.  Some would dim and blink out, only to re-appear nearby, growing brighter as they moved rapidly from side to side, then up and down.  The best was a magenta light that changed to a brilliant emerald green color and started blinking rapidly.  This ship stayed close, brilliant  and visible the whole time I was watching.  There was also one very bright stationary magenta craft that followed this same pattern.  I could not make out craft shapes due to their distance from me, however there is no doubt they were intelligently controlled, and in my opinion, 'not from around here'.  It was very interesting that although there were about 30 folks with us watching the fireworks, none saw the lights, or at least none remarked as such.

880,"ISS-looking bright ufo flies over Washington at great speed or low altitude, or both....I am open to any explanation as to what I saw, but, I feel I am pretty good at identifying aerial phenomenon, and I can’t figure this one out.7/4/2017, 2155 hours PST, watching fireworks.  I already know what you are thinking.  No.Not 30 seconds before I stated, maybe we will see a UFO.  And then there it was.  The following is why I am baffled.  Location, general, King County, Washington State, general street coordinates 195 Av NE/NE 175 St.  Direction of flight, southeast.Appearance, looked like the ISS going over, but about 5 or more times faster in travel, and….maybe twice as bright.  ISS is not supposed to be visible here tonight.  There was an Iridium Flare listed for about 2155, but I thought it was going to flare to the north, not travel southeast-bound like a bright, non-dimming object that looked like a bright ISS.My millisecond thought process as I watched it for about 4-5 seconds (it was moving out!) was at first….oh, there’s a piece of burning magnesium powder from a firework.Wait, it is not dimming, and it is moving in a straight line.  Oh, looks like the ISS.  Negative, it is not visible tonight.  This is too fast, the speed is like a low flying airplane going over.  But it is bright.  Maybe an aircraft, no, not seeing any green/red navigation lights, just looks exactly like a bright ISS.The only way I can try to explain it is, but I don’t believe my own explanation because of what I saw, was, a helicopter flying over with a bright search light shining mainly downward, drowning out the red/green nav lights, and I can’t hear it because of the fireworks in the area.So, UFO is correct in that, I can’t identify what I saw.  I would welcome any explanation because I am not sure how to classify this in my own mind.  If I could look at radar recordings in this area, I would do so.  If anybody can, and they can tell me what the heck it was that we saw, I would appreciate it.  I only had, at best, 10 degrees of view because of a nearby tree, but we saw it continue on, without dimming, through the branches a couple times.UPDATE:  I started reporting this at about 2245 hours PST, 7/4/2017.  My brother texted, and we have since spoken on the phone.  He is in Maui.  His text, at 2252 hours PST was, “I think I just saw the space station go over Maui here and it was hauling as_”.   More texts, and I had to call him.  He is in Kaanapoli.  Looking WNW between Molokai and Lanai Islands.  He sees something in the sky to the SW, south of Lanai, moving generally west to east, but south of his location.  I questioned him carefully.  No nav lights, looked exactly like the ISS, not dimmer or brighter, but many times faster.  He thought, jet airliner altitude (30000 feet or so).  He explained it away as the ISS, but hauling as_.  He next explained it away as a satellite losing altitude and coming back to earth.  No trail at all, like shooting stars or space debris (which I have seen back in I believe the 90’s when a piece of Soviet debris came down and was visible from Washington State, it left a green trail! as it burned on re-entry).  How long did he see it?  2 to 3 seconds!  Wow.  Mine was 4-5 seconds, and I am sure he had a better view in Maui.  The thing was moving fast!.Ok, I am done for now.  I have not been stumped by objects in the sky until tonight, and I am in my 50’s.  So, there it is, for comparison to other reports.  My gut feeling is, if my girlfriend and I saw something and my brother saw something far away in Maui, there may be a slew of sightings coming in!  While I was typing this, my girlfriend already found youtube videos from tonight with ufo’s, UFO spotted in Norwalk, California, July 7th 2017.  But, the ufo in that video was barely moving compared to what we saw.  And, what we saw was more of a white light, like the ISS, not orange.  Signing off.  I hope to learn from other reports if I am still waiting to see my first UFO, or if this is explainable and I need to keep looking.  Thanks PD!

884,"Two green lights hovering outside of Washington, DC.I live near Washington, DC, and got up to look out the window to see if I could spot any fireworks.  As a preface, I do not drink or smoke, and although I was a little tired when this took place, I was looking out the window simply out of curiosity.  While I'm interested in UFOs, on the whole I have generally been a skeptic in this field.  Sometimes I have seen objects that I think are unusual, but it turns out to be a plane or a planet.  This was different given the motion of the object and the clarity.  Being the Fourth of July, I also thought a rogue firework might be behind this, but the object was visible for 20-30 minutes, moved with purpose, and was soundless.I noticed a green light which was pulsating at regular intervals, hovering several miles away without moving.  I thought this was a helicopter, but it was unusual because the light was blinking green (no other colors) and wasn’t moving.As it so happened, a plane/helicopter flew by as I was watching this object, and there were a few main differences easily apparent -  1.)  The plane moved in a linear direction. Helicopters, when seen, generally do too.  This object was stationary.2.)  The plane had a blinking white tail light, along with red and green running lights. The object I was seeing had neither. Shortly after the plane passed, the object ascended rapidly and stopped. I thought this was odd because usually helicopters will gather momentum as they ascend and they’ll stop as they reach their new destination.  This object simply went up and stopped.I moved to another room with a better vantage point and viewed the object directly for ~15 minutes as it moved occasionally.  The object was located to my south and would have been by my estimation about 4-8 miles away.  It blinked green continuously (no light, green light, no light) at regular intervals.  It moved behind a tree and I believe I saw it flash more rapidly with a pinkish color but I am not certain.  During this time it moved in one direction, stop briefly, then would reverse direction or move in another direction.  Planes and other aircraft curve to meet a path - this moved fairly linearly.  I don’t believe this was a drone as I don’t think I would have been able to see it as far away as it was, given the distance, and it moved past the trees, and moved back to near its original position.  I attempted to take several photographs and videos of the object, but it is difficult to make out in most.The object then moved directly towards me and I saw there were two lights as part of the object. I could not identify a shape of the object but it seemed as though the lights were on the underside, if indeed there was an object.  It passed directly over my residence and hovered there for a second, before moving on.  The lights were bright and there were very clearly two of them, side by side (left-right oriented).  The lights were two large to be running lights on an aircraft, my best analogy is as though someone put two small flashlights together and pointed them down.I went out my front door to look at it and saw it moving in the reverse direction, but it was silent.  I could still clearly see two green lights.  I estimate it was flying lower than typical small plane but cannot estimate its altitude in feet/meters.I went to go outside to try to take more footage but as I was doing so, the object went back to its original position, hovered, then moved off to the W-SW.

885,"Star like objects in near space visible from Spokane Valley.I observed two closely spaced (in time and space) sightings on July 4th.  First object crossed sky, a point source, star like, about the brightness of Saturn, following an arc from about Arcturus in Bootes across the face of the moon (or behind?) and disappeared near the planet Saturn.  Assuming the object fell into Earth’s shadow, it was slightly higher than LEO.  From the fact this object was noiseless, covered the distance in about 12 seconds and using the ISS for reference it was travelling about 80 miles/second, or about 5 times orbital escape velocity in LEO.The next series of star like objects occurred about 10:05 (p.m.?), when I noticed a bright object, about 5 moon widths to the west of Zubeneschamali in Libra, after noticing this first object, about the brightness of Saturn.  Within a second or two, two dimmer objects, the first about ½ degree north of Zubeneschamali, the second directly north about 3 moon widths.  The effect was to create an isosceles triangle, with the base composed of two dimmer stars and the brighter star at the apex forming a triangle pointing to the west.  The three objects slowly moved to the north, but disappeared before moving a Moon’s width (1/2 degree) and within 2-3 seconds of the 10:05 sighting of the apex star like object.I have verified there were NO satellites of sufficient magnitude to have been mistaken for the objects.  Neither were the objects asteroids or meteors, there was no ionization trail, and there are no visible Earth-crossing asteroids at this time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

893,"15 red-orange discs at Minnesota fireworksAs we have done every year since 2006, my wife and I attended a July 4th public fireworks display presented by the Wabasha Fire Department, not far from the west bank of the Mississippi River, in southeastern Minnesota, some eighty-five miles south from Minneapolis.  Shortly after sundown, around 9:00 p.m., we arrived on the east side of the city lagoon, over which the pyrotechnical show would take place.  As it began at 9:30 under a clear sky of unlimited visibility---save somewhat less so in the west, where thin clouds had gathered --- with a waxing-gibbous moon rising behind us, three objects appeared, one behind the other, around one thousand-foot altitude or less.		 I estimate each of the nearly identical craft was thirty to thirty-five feet in diameter.  From underneath them, golden flames projected downward in a rough, splayed pattern.  Reflecting in these flames was the reddish-orange underside of the objects.  They seemed disc-shaped to me, but my wife wondered if they may have been more spherical, as only the structures’ ventral area might have been illuminated by the fiery discharge streaming from the craft’s bottom section.  The three objects were regularly spaced from one another by approximately one hundred twenty feet or one hundred fifty feet, in a line formation that took them from the east, directly above the fireworks display, over which their initially rapid advance slowed to little more than a crawl, before they picked up a bit more speed, while executing a broad, climbing curve toward the west, one craft after another, gradually disappearing into the thin cloud cover.  Their construction appeared utterly unaerodynamic, and they seemed to less actually fly, than to be moved, not propelled, across the sky in the manner a stone picked up and transported from one place to another.  That, in any case, was the impression their flight made.During long pauses in the exploding fireworks, we strained our ears, but failed to perceive any sound from the flying objects passing practically overhead.  Perhaps five minutes after they became hardly more than faint sparks in the western sky, another group of almost identical craft --- also, perhaps, in threes--approached on precisely the exact, same heading executed in the night sky by their predecessors.  Like them, the newcomers arrived speedily, but quickly decelerated, cruising directly above the fireworks, then somewhat increased their velocity to follow the first set of craft identically into the west, no less precisely than if they were riding on a railroad track. 							 Other groups of the same kind of vehicles followed in circa five-minute intervals; all behaved in identical fashion, abiding unswervingly to the same, broadly curving course from east to west.  Their only apparent differentiations included color and its intensity.  One or two of the objects were entirely bright white, while most were reddish-orange, some more pronounced than others.  On three or four of them, I discerned darker, indistinct details lining the illuminated “disc”.  At first sight, I assumed for a moment that the objects must have been hot-air balloons, flying lanterns or aerostats of some kind, because they did partially resemble them at a distance.  But as they approached nearer, their varying speeds, unvarying course, and downward extending flames immediately identified them as something else.  The penultimate object was especially distinct and brightly lit in its discoidal or spherical configuration.  Altogether, we counted fifteen such craft.  The last one sailed directly above the fireworks’ big finale, over the center of the exploding display.  Total duration of all Wabasha sightings on the evening of July 4, 2017, coincided with the city’s Independence Day pyrotechnical program from the moment it began until its final shot, as though the disc pilots somehow knew the program in advance, allowing their own, perfect timing.  Their behavior made us both feel that they were solely interested in observing the fireworks.",Duration:20-30 minutes,"Location: Wabasha, MN",Occurred : 7/4/2017 21:30  (Entered as : 7/4/2017 21:30),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 7/5/2017 10:16:06 PM 22:16,Shape: Disk

922,"At 10 PM, on July 3rd, 2017 my brother was walking by his kitchen sink when he noted an odd light in the sky from the kitchen window.  We walked out on the nearby porch and observed a burnt orange light to the north at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  It was a distinct orange light, with no discernible dimension to the naked eye, with a brightness comparable to the headlight of a commercial jet.We watched this light for several minutes from the kitchen porch, and observed during that time two successive white lights drop vertically downward from the orange light.  These white lights quickly faded out after their emission from the orange object, approximately 1 or 2 degrees below the object.  My impression was that the white lights moved faster than one would expect for freefall, while my brother thought the motion was consistent with freefall.Somewhat excited, we raced to the roof deck for a better view.  By the time we got there, a minute later, the object was no longer visible.  We looked in the location of the sky where it had last been seen, which was the constellation Cassiopeia, for a minute, or so.  Suddenly, a bright orange flash erupted near the middle star of the Cassiopeia constellation, that persisted for a split second.  As that occurred I thought I saw a faint streak of light angling upwards at 60 degrees to the left of the flash.  We observed nothing after that.When on the lower porch, earlier, we examined the object with 10 power binoculars, but it still was very small, seemingly pointlike.  My brother thought it had a round shape.  We considered that it might have been a Chinese lantern, with the white objects being flaming pieces of wax falling out of the lantern.  But its brightness, combined with its small angular size, as seen in 10 power binoculars, seemed to exclude that possibility.",Duration:2-3 minutes,"Location: Acworth, NH",Occurred : 7/3/2017 22:00  (Entered as : 07/03/17 22:00),Posted: 7/14/2017,Reported: 7/9/2017 7:36:32 AM 07:36,Shape: Sphere

I expected to see red running lights and/or white landing lights indicating the craft was on approach to Bradley International Airport to the West, but there were no other lights.  The object then moved a little Southward while blinking erratically, then abru! ptly turned at a 90 degree angle and went a bit toward the East, stopped, then took off, accelerating, in a Northeasterly direction for what looked like 2 or 3 inches and then disappeared.

Still this looked like a satellite, but it was changing speed and direction like nothing I'd ever seen in the sky.  I pointed it out to my friend and she said the same, it looked like a satellite, then when it started moving in circles she said, ""what the hell is that?""

This thing was immense but just how large was hard to tell because of the distance.I glanced at my watch, it was 12:25 PM.There are a lot of trees alongside the highway and this is a hilly area, so I lost sight of the craft a couple of times by going up and down the hills, but I saw it for approximately a total of 30 to 45 seconds, before I lost sight of it for good because of the lay of the land.I was looking for a place on the shoulder to pull over and stop and jump out and run back to tell my wife and daughter what I had just seen and when I did it was just before a T intersection with a road to the left, so I told my wife about what I had seen and told her to drive down that road and see if she could see the object which she did and she never saw it.I'll be 67 years old next month August, and I've been waiting all my life, knowing there are UFOs and extraterrestrials out there.Now I have finally seen a UFO, the real deal.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally serious-minded person.

It was a beautiful clear evening.  We didn’t have a clear view of the fireworks; they were visible through the trees only.

The orb was stationary above the tree line for a good 3-5 minutes, in which time we had a discussion.  Was it a plane watching for fires?  We reasoned a plane couldn’t stay in one location for so long.  We changed our logic and thought perhaps a helicopter.  It seemed to still and small to be a helicopter, there was no sound that we could detect.  We then reasoned it was a droid.  We have no knowledge of droids or their behavior.  Then the orb started moving in our direction, it gave off no sound, changed its color form em! erald green to red, moved behind a tree about 20 yards from us, changed color back to green and floated off in a southern direction beyond our view.  That was weird, we decided, what was that?  Within 5 minutes, it came back again, hovering above the tree line where it first appeared, to the left of the fireworks display.

A drone?  Definitely not a UFO, right?  Well.  That was weird.I had just about settled down again to a regular pace when I saw a spire of light appear suddenly to the north.  It was long and tapered, like an icicle, and it was either shining up from the northern horizon like a stalagmite, or shining down from the clouds like a spotlight.  I couldn't tell which, but it was moving from east to west, covering about 10 degrees of arc per second.Now, seriously.  Come on...  WHUT. THUH?  I watched it for about five seconds, in a kind of stupor, until it moved behind some trees and I lost sight of it.  I ran back toward the football field and past the stands to get a better view, but it had disappeared.  I stood still for about a minute, watching the sky and wondering what would happen next... and then the green light appeared again!  It was closer this time, and I could see that it wasn't a single light.  It was actually three green lights, huddled closely together, in the shape of a triangle...HUH???  I watched as it hung in the air, perfectly still, and then it began to move to the left, accelerating.  It went out again for about two seconds, and when it came back on it was perfectly still.  Then it moved again, to the right this time, and then it went out again.  When it came on again it described a speeding up, slowing down, to the left then to the right, then up, and then a sharp curve downward motion, and then it accelerated along its original path and disappeared.

946,"Very rapid point of white light zips across night sky, then stops abruptly and remains static like the stars around it.I am a 50 year old male who has enjoyed camping and stargazing since I was a kid.  In that time, I have watched countless satellites cross the sky, and am very familiar with their relative brightness and speed, and that most of them tend to move along an equatorial route instead of a polar route.  I am also very familiar with the ISS, and use a phone app that tracks its orbit.On July 1, 2017, the skies were clear.  I was outside moving items out of my brother's Dodge Siesta RV, which was parked at a rural residence between Kent and Auburn, Washington.  Among the items was a pair of Jason brand binoculars, 50x magnification.  They are powerful enough to see the 4 largest moons of Jupiter on a clear night.I had been bending and lifting boxes, so I decided to take a break by laying on my back across the hood of my car and use the binoculars for stargazing.  Within seconds, I caught sight of what I first thought was a satellite moving from south to north in a straight line.  Immediately I knew it couldn't be a satellite because of its incredible speed, yet it was too slow to be a meteor.  Typically, if I keep the binoculars still (not panning to follow movement) and let a satellite cross my field of view, it takes between 15 to 20 seconds to cross depending on my angle of perspective.  This object passed the binocular's field of view in about 4 seconds.  Assuming that directly above my head is 0 degrees, the object was about 20 degrees eastward of my location.  It appeared like most satellites; a single point of white light like a star moving in a straight line.  The light reflecting off it was as bright as the average star.  I listened for the sound of jets, but heard nothing.  I figured it had to be a military jet, but a jet appearing as a single point of light through 50x magnification would have to be at an extremely high altitude, and this object was moving far too fast to be a jet at such a distance.  I tracked the object's movement for about 20 to 25 seconds.  Then it stopped.  It didn't gradually slow to a stop.  It stopped the way an Indy 500 car stops when it hits a granite wall.  I kept the binoculars trained on the point of light for a couple more minutes, but it sat motionless like it was just another star.I told my brother what I had just witnessed, and he directed me to your sight to file a report.",Duration:~2.5 minutes,"Location: Kent/Auburn, WA",Occurred : 7/1/2017 23:50  (Entered as : 07/01/17 23:50),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 7/3/2017 4:14:59 AM 04:14,Shape: Light

956,"Bright object over Aurora that changed shapes as it left.We were sitting outside late afternoon and noticed a stationary light at high altitude.  It appeared to be “twinkling” and we wondered if it might be a weather balloon.  Looking at it through binoculars, we saw that it appeared to be a sphere with two smaller spheres that were either rotating around it, or the object itself was revolving, as the central sphere would shine a very bright light which would then disappear, only to reappear within a second or two.  We had a difficult time at first determining its shape because of the brightness of this light that appeared and disappeared.The light, which we at first thought might be just reflection, was very strong, and seemed to have a “diffraction” effect around the edges, which were blurry and rainbow colored.  We decided that it was no reflection, but that the sphere was actually emanating the light.After about 15 minutes, the object drifted north, and we followed its path, still observing through binoculars.  The drift made us decide it might be a balloon after all, but we kept watching because it was so unusual.  After about 10 minutes, it drifted south again, to return to its original spot.  This of course sharpened our focus, as its movements were now not simple “drifting,” but purposeful.  Then, suddenly, it started to head west, which would bring it almost overhead. It accelerated slowly at first, and as we watched we noticed that its form seemed to shift.  Overhead, we could see that the material it was made of was extremely shiny, almost like glass, and highly reflective.  The object was flying in a straight line but it “rocked” and “pitched” a little, so that the light emanating from it plus the reflectivity made it difficult to determine what was happening, as it seemed to be changing shape, elongating, and splitting into a boomerange shape, but with a middle sectio! n that was slightly smaller than the two edges.  Within a few seconds it lost all luminosity and became a dull dark grey triangle with what looked like 5 darker circles, one at each apex and two between those at the top and bottom.  It flew perpendicular to the earth so we could see the shape clearly, and rapidly disappeared in the distance.After about twenty minutes, we looked in the same direction we had originally seen it, and it was back in the same spot, but this time at a much higher altitude.  It stayed in that spot for about ten minutes, looking like the sphere with the light and the two smaller spheres rotating around it, then it changed to the dark grey triangle again.

It was too round, so I figured a weather balloon or a test balloon that the hot air balloonists use around here to measure wind currents.  No reference as to size, it could have been a half-mile or more away.  I was concerned because commercial aircraft regularly fly over around 20-30k feet on one leg of the instrument approach to San Francisco Bay area airports.  I continued to watch and noticed a couple of black bands around the balloon at angles to each other that I thought was odd but at the distance it now was any detail was lost.  The balloon continued it's assent and I noticed a few small wispy clouds in a clear sky above where it looked like it was heading.  It reached the clouds and stopped it's ascent and appeared to move back and forth horizontally in short movements.

It appeared to be at a higher altitude than any recreational drones I’ve ever seen, its movements were definitely not consistent with those of an airplane, and we did not hear any helicopter or aircraft sounds.  It had a fiery, and slightly flickery or pulsing, orange glow and didn’t seem to have any blinking lights like a traditional aircraft.

I pulled over to the side of the road to study it--because it was brighter than Venus was at the time in the sky - and tried to load an app on my phone to identify the object.  At this point, it got brighter and brighter and then turned from a glowing white-ish yellow to a orange orb.  It got quite large-at least 4x the size of Venus in the sky and then quickly faded, until I could not see it anymore.I have searched the databases for any meteors or other events but could find none.This event actually repeated the following morning, 6/30.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous; provides little contact information.

974,"Green orb light balls at 4:31am in Charlottesville, VABirds were chirping very loudly outside of my apartment around 4:00am in the morning.  The volume of the chirping progressed to the point where I decided to see if there was a nest outside my apartment because I could not fall asleep.  When I opened the door, there was a large green ball shaped object fairly low in the sky (lower than the moon which was not visible from my door).  I quickly called my boyfriend to the door to see and as he came to the door, the single ball separated or multiplied into two balls which grew in size then dissolved slowly.  Seconds after, two more ball appeared (almost looked like they popped in the sky), then four more in perfect symmetry; they appeared like a number four looks like on dice. Seconds after that, another burst of four balls 'popped' in the sky.  My boyfriend and I both did double takes as we could not believe what we were seeing.  Additionally, we found the birds' behavior perplexing as I have never heard birds before at that hour of the morning nor have I seen them be so active (dodging and fleeting from tree to tree).  Shortly after all the balls dissolved into the sky (total of about a minute, two at most), the birds chirping ceased and the night was quiet once again.  Lastly, we speculated that it could be fireworks but there were no sounds coming from the lights or any other sounds other than the birds that we could hear.  The balls did evolve in color, beginning in green, then to yellowish orange color until they faded away completely.

They looked almost like white clouds against a pitch black sky, except perfectly round.  The effect was like the moon being behind a cloud.  I’m not 100% sure they were lights, but because they were perfectly round, and in a square formation, I have to rule out the possibility of them being clouds.While spending several seconds observing them, I noticed what seemed to be a faint replica of these lights, just to the right, except almost gone – as if they were dissipating .  The “lights” did not move, either  around the sky, or in relation to each other.  They kept a fixed position.

The object was nearly due north of my location (approx. 350 degrees) and fairly low on the horizon (approx 15-20 degrees).  The object appeared to be at a great distance, at least a few miles away, but distance, size and altitude were hard to gauge without any point of reference.The object appeared to emanate a greenish white light or glow.  The sun had set just a while before and could have been illuminating the object.  The object or craft made very erratic high speed maneuvers unlike anything I have witnessed before.

1019,"Slow moving dark colored triangular object with no lights or sound moving west and low in night sky.I work as a security officer at a building in Louisville.  I was outside driving the parking lot in the patrol vehicle, when I happened to look up and spot an object, triangular in shape, but rounded at the corners, moving across the sky very slowly.  There was no noise from the object, nor any lights emitting from it.  It was 11:45pm and the sky was partly cloudy.  I could see a few small clouds in the sky near the object, and could determine that the object was not a cloud as it was moving slightly faster than the surrounding clouds.  At night in the city, clouds have an orange color at the bottoms as the street lights of the city reflect off of them.  The object however didn’t have the same coloration at the bottom.  It was of a darker grey color at the bottom, with a lighter gray color on the top.  I was viewing this object at its left side.  My patrol vehicle was facing west, and the object was moving east along with the clouds.  The object did not ! have a shiny surface from what I could see.  As far as the size of the object, it was at least the size of 5 school buses, maybe a bit larger.  It was very low in the sky and I could tell it was big.  I asked our camera operator in the dispatch office to see if they could get the object on camera, unfortunately they were not looking at the same direction as I was, and therefore I was the only witness.  The entire sighting lasted somewhere between 30 to 60 seconds.  It continued to head west until out of view.  I am still excited over this sighting even after nearly 90 minutes after the fact.

1020,"Large, well lit up, unidentified craft at sea level rose and flew into night sky before disappearing.On the night of Monday 26th June, I was working night shift on an oil rig in the Southern sector of the North Sea.  I won’t give the name of the oil rig but the closest marker to it is buoy 62144.We are not allowed cameras or phones outside on the platform as it is a hazardous area and it is an ignition risk so I will try my best to describe what I seen.  It may be a bit clumsy.At approx. 2330 hours, I was working outside and needed to urinate.  Rather than go up the many flights of stairs and all the way into the accommodation I decided to urinate over the side, into the sea.I proceeded to the South side of the platform and in front me was what at first I thought was a helicopter, we sometimes get emergency flights at night.Once I had taken in what I was looking at it was clear to me I wasn’t looking at anything I had ever seen before. It was very close to me and close to the surface of the sea.I will try my best to describe it--A large oval shape, cannot say what size, as there is nothing close to gauge it against.  I am guessing it was the size of a medium sized plane.  It had coloured lights around its centre, and these were moving from left to right, changing from red, blue and green.  It had a large amount of white light emanating from the bottom of it, this is why I thought it was a helicopter, it looked like a massive searchlight focussed on the sea.  It was extremely well lit up.It didn’t appear to be moving, or was moving very slowly at first but more looked like it had just surfaced from the sea.There was another red light much further and higher to the South of this one.I watched it for approximately 20 seconds, then decided to fetch my two work colleagues.By the time we got back it had flown a considerable distance but was still clearly visible.It was heading in a Westerly direction.  By this time the shape wasn’t discernible but the lights around its centre were still flashing from left to right but this time only appeared to be red.The stand by boat for the rig was close by and was pointed directly at it.  There was also a reasonably sized manned rig over to the West.Regarding sound, I was working in a reasonably high noise level area and had ear defenders on but I didn’t hear anything.  If it had been a chopper for example I would still have heard something as there are about 6 flights a day on here and you can hear them even with ear defenders on.The light that was coming off it wasn’t exactly subtle and it was clear it didn’t care about being seen.  I am struggling to process exactly what it was I did see.I am glad my 2 colleagues also witnessed it, albeit at a much further distance.  It was like nothing I have ever seen and until my dying day I will never see anything like it again.I have looked on line to see if any images come close to help me describe it and the one that looks most like it is the Roswell photo.  The colours best to describe it are in an image of a ufo with Tom Delonge.I’m attaching both to help with my description.I am stopping to tell people now because I am not being taken seriously and am in danger of being seen as nut- which is fair enough, as I know how it sounds.  I hope you believe me, you must get loads of these, but if not I feel better just for sharing.I want to document it officially before my memory of it starts to cloud.  (It never will), but don’t know how.I also don’t know who to contact to see if any other witnesses who also spotted something but this is a start.  If the crew of the stand by boat were looking outside they couldn’t miss it.Looked very much like the black and white photo but the lights around the centre were like in the second photo.The light at the bottom was slightly different, appeared to be more than one.I will never forgive myself for not getting a photo or filming it.",Duration:2 minutes,"Location: North Sea (on oil rig), ",Occurred : 6/26/2017 23:30  (Entered as : 26/06/17 23:30),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 6/29/2017 12:22:05 AM 00:22,Shape: Disk

I was alone in my car, exiting the parking lot of Bed Bath & Beyond (4102 S Meridian, Puyallup, WA 98373) and noticed lots of interesting cloud formations.  It almost looked like a bunch of angels fighting or like a “battle between good and evil” was happening in the sky.I turned left onto 43rd, Ave SW and started heading east toward Meridian Street, a busy main road that runs North/South down the center of Puyallup.  I called my friend, who also lives in Puyallup, to tell him about the amazing cloud formations I was seeing.  He looked out the east-facing window of his home, a couple of miles away from my location, and agreed that there were some interesting looking clouds in the sky.  He asked me to take some pictures, so I quickly took a few images with my camera phone, an ASIS Laser 3.Later, when I was looking at the pictures on my camera, I also noticed what appeared to be multiple “faces” in the cloud formations.  Two days later (June 27), I was showing these faces in the clouds to the same friend I had called earlier and he immediately noticed an object in the sky near the clouds.  He said, “What is that?…That’s a UFO!”  I was stunned because I hadn’t noticed the object in the picture before this time.We looked at the other two pictures I had taken and noticed the same object but in different positions in the sky.  The object had obviously been moving because it’s the only thing changing locations in the picture.  Everything else is stable, or in the same location: streetlights, the sign, trees, and reflections from the dashboard of the car onto the glass.I still don’t know what to think of the object.  I’m not a “UFO person.”  My friend, though, is convinced that it cannot be a reflection in the glass, an airplane, a balloon, or any other familiar/manmade object, and so urged me to report it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness submits photo, which suggests to us that the anomalous objects seen in it may be reflections of objects on the dash board of her vehicle.

They moved slightly up then slightly down, hovered for a few minutes, dropped lower in the sky and proceeded very slowly to the right.  The lights seemed to come from a fairly large craft but it was hard to tell due to distance.The lights disappeared for a while, but then reappeared a few minutes later in another spot.  We did not know if this was the same craft that somehow got to an entirely different place in the sky without us seeing or another craft entirely.  This one was closer and the lights were brighter.  It followed the same hover pattern for a few minutes and this too drifted out of our line of sight.  As we stood there this same thing happened two more times--flashing lights in different parts of the sky (I would describe them as having a strobe like effect).  The craft would hover and go slightly up, down and sideways for a few minutes before drifting off.  There was no noise and the only color we saw was whitish yellow light.  It wasn't shining a light as a helicopter might do if it was performing a search but more or less just twinkeled. I do not know how it was able to appear in different parts of the sky without us seeing it get there.

1060,"Sillver cigar shaped object witnessed by 2 people in eastern Washington.  Object hovered in western sky before vanishingMy husband and I were driving from Tekoa, Washington, to Spokane, Washington,  around noon last Saturday.  We were nearing the southern side of Fairfield, Washington.  My husband pointed to the north and about half jokingly said, ""Look.  A UFO.""  I looked and replied, ""Oh, that's a plane.""  As we got closer to Fairfield, we continued to watch the object, and the more we watched, the more we became convinced that what we were looking at was something out of the ordinary.  I would call myself a UFO enthusiast, though this was my first sighting.  My husband is a confirmed skeptic, but even HE couldn't say what the object was.  It was cigar shaped and white or silver.  It moved at a pretty good rate of speed from the North to the West.  We lost sight of it for maybe 30 seconds as we entered Fairfield.  When we saw it again, it was sitting stationary in the western sky.  I found this odd.  I said to my husband, ""If it hadn't been going so fast, I would say it's a blimp.""  It was also way too high up to be a blimp.  When we got further into Fairfield, we lost sight of it again, and as we exited the Fairfield city limits, we could no longer see it.  It was simply gone.  Anyone who has been through Fairfield, knows it is very small and doesn't take long to get through going north on the highway.  It might take a minute so it didn't make sense to me that the object was just gone.  It was a clear day and should have still been visible.

There were approximately 200-300 lights in a clustering.  The closest comparison I could think of would be similar to a school of fish or tadpoles.  The objects were paler than stars (like almost a blue, but not quite), and the light they gave off seemed less concentrated than the stars in the sky around.  The group moved like a school of fish slowly towards the horizon, with a few straggling behind the group.  The group did not move in a straight line like a meteor shower, but rather as if something floating along.  I called my father out to see, and he came and witnessed the event with me, and then shortly after, my brother came out and saw the last stragglers move across the sky.

1073,"Ufo spotted two days before possible MIB and electrical/radio interference and large owl sightingIt started a few days ago.  I was watering my plants on the front porch, when I saw this bright object in the sky.  At first I thought it was a meteor, and I told my father's girlfriend to come look.  She saw it as well, my father merely glanced at it from the backyard and said it was a ""plane or something.""  It was flying near Baker's Corner store in Longview, WA.  I knew it wasn't a plane crashing down or a meteor because it had no smoke billowing from it.  I recorded the part where it shaped into a ball from its fireball shape.  It was a very bright silver metallic that reflected in the sunset.  However, the recording is saved onto my snapchat so I am unable to post here...Yesterday, my friends and I went to Willow Grove Beach in Longview.  We stopped at Baker's Corner like we normally do to get tea and such for the hot day ahead of us (we have had record heat already).  When we got to the grove, however, this man came up to us in a van and told us that the park was closing in ten minutes.  I wanted to tell him, ""Oh, okay, thank you,"" but all that came out was, ""Oh"" and I turned around and walked to the beach.  I don't know what came over me, but I was very afraid of him, as were my friends.  We swam for a while with some friends, and once our friends were with us they stopped patrolling.  During our time in the water we noticed that there was a party taking place further down the beach and the security had not stopped to inform them of the curfew.  We stayed for maybe 30 min until another van came down the trail with its light flashing.  They were headed for us, so we rushed out of the water to my friend's truck.  They followed slowl! y down the trail.  They were both wearing sunglasses and they were pale, I didn't look at them long.  We left and went to eat at a restaurant in the sister town, but after dinner, I realized I had forgotten my purse.  It wasn't in the restaurant, so we had to drive all the way back to willow.  My chest hurt as we got closer to our destination, it was almost hard to breathe.  My friends seemed nervous as well.  It might have been because of the creepy security men before, but it felt much heavier than that.  As we started down the 2 mile stretch of road to the beach, the truck began acting strange.  The lights flickered and turned off then on and the brights turned on etc., and at first I thought it was my friend messing with the lights until she said, ""Did you guys see that?""  I looked up from my phone which was glitching out and focused on the lights on the road.  They turned off for a moment, the radio was disrupted, and it was eerily quiet.  Then the internal lights turned on brighter than I had seen them and the windshield wipers started ging at full speed, the gages twitched and flickered and then everything went dark.  We could see under the moon and decided to turn around in a farmers driveway right before the boat launch.  The lights came back and we took off.  We all felt sick and sufficiently spooked, and as we turned left back towards the highway, a huge white owl swooped down behind the truck and into the tall grass on the other side of the road.  We got back to our friends after midnight, which was strange because the grove isn't very far from where she lived.What do you all think?  Is there a correlation between the strange curfew and the strange security van men?  The owl?

I tried to drive in the direction I saw it after I lost sight of it, but I couldn't find an answer to what it was.  I talked to a couple different police officers on duty near the airport, I called air traffic control and I am waiting for a call back.Today was my second sighting of this object flying through the early morning sky, same location and about the same time.  The first time I saw this object was 06/19/17 in the North Eastern sky while observing Venus between 3am and 4am PST.  I tried to wake my wife up that night to show her, and of course it was gone by the time she came out.  I went out and bought a Nikon p900 to get some close up shots of the moon, Jupiter and Saturn this week.  Early this morning I went around the same time as I did on the 19th in search of this object, and there it was.  I ran inside grabbed my camera that I don't have a clue how to operate and shot this footage.  I did a terrible job shooting the footage, but hopefully it's enough to show what I was looking at.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Pasco, WA",Occurred : 6/23/2017 03:50  (Entered as : 06/23/17 3:50),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 6/23/2017 7:44:24 AM 07:44,Shape: Unknown
1083,"Red light moving rapidly across the sky in all directions at immense speed.Sighted at plane height over Omaha, Nebraska.  We watched from a hill and initially spotted it as a small, stationary, red ball of light.  It would occasionally switch to a blinking green light and then back to red.  After looking at it for some time, it rapidly moved to the left, stopped, and it changed to a blinking green light. It then ascended in the blink of an eye (literally).  As soon as you blinked, the light was an immense distance higher than it had been a second previously.  We could see it ascending through the clouds so quickly that it could've climbed out of our sight in probably two seconds.  It then turned back to a static red light (stopped flashing) and darted to the right across the entire sky.  It was moving so quickly that we had to sprint to keep up with it.  It covered the whole horizon.  It then paused on a dime, shifted slightly to the left, and began a fast descent until it disappeared from sight into storm clouds.  Only one light was observed.  It was so high in the sky, and so erratically moving, that we could not place it as any normal object.  We have never seen a normal object move so quickly and at such a high height.  It was also quite far away, so for it to look as though it was moving so quickly, it must have been going at an unfathomably rapid speed.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Omaha, NE",Occurred : 6/22/2017 21:06  (Entered as : 06/22/2017 21:06),Posted: 7/7/2017,Reported: 6/22/2017 7:58:23 PM 19:58,Shape: Light

I immediately yelled to my wife to come and look.  She came outside and saw exactly what I saw.  The 2 colors (green and red) were very bright.  I then told her to get my phone and of course by the time she got back and I turned it on and started recording, it was gone but that isn't the end of what I witnessed.A couple of caveats to point out.1.  This object ""just appeared.""  My chair where I was sitting just happened to be pointing in that direction, so I was basically looking at the area in the sky and it just appeared where as if it where a plane, it would have been seen coming from the left.2.  When the object disappeared, it didn't just disappeard, it was moving father and father away and then we could no longer see the lights.3.  No noise.  No sound  4.  The object was up in the sky quite a bit.  About 15 minutes later, an actual plane was taking off, and was about 70% lower than the object, really just right above the horizon.About 30 minutes later directly overhead we seen what seemed to be the same object except for this time it was extremely high in the sky but you could still faintly see the green and red lights. It was so high that you know it couldn't be any sort of tower.  What is odd that a star was sitting right to the left of this object and you could see them both fairly well although the star was much brighter.Cloud cover came in and I could no longer see the object but it was just sitting there for about 20 minutes.  I have no idea if this was the same object or a different object.  I will be on the lookout this evening.  This was our experience.  This is what we saw and I'm just glad I had a witness.  My gut tells me that this is our own craft because when it first de-materialized or appeared it would've been in the air space here.",Duration:2 minutes,"Location: Chiang Rai (Thailand), ",Occurred : 6/18/2017 20:08  (Entered as : 06/18/2017 8:08),Posted: 6/22/2017,Reported: 6/19/2017 1:29:45 AM 01:29,Shape: Unknown

1121,"Brightly lit almond-shaped craft static in the sky in Panama.An almond- (or oval-) shaped UFO in the sky in Panama City, Panama, was observed in a direction where no such object was observed for a whole two years prior to June 18, 2017.  Proximity to building provided reference point that the craft was static.  The object generated its own energy source as it was brightly lit.  (It recalled a previous sighting in early childhood in South America observed by the entire neighborhood which also featured an object that was similarly lit.  That object sat up in the sky but slightly higher than the horizon).  This craft was located much higher up, possibly in the Earth’s upper atmosphere.  But it was far closer than a satellite would have been and, again, it did not move.  Stars that evening were also clearly seen and looked like distant dots.  Object also appeared to have a rod-like shaft of light sticking downward out of its belly.  It is not possible to tell whether it was a light beam or a solid part of the craft.  The general impression was similar to that of a wasp in flight — except that the object did not move.  Because the craft’s shape was elongated, it could have well been a transport vehicle.  But it was too far up in the sky to make out any occupants.  It also looked rather large.  Observer does not know how long the object remained in place as it was only seen for an hour, after which the person went to bed.  Observer has seen craft with the naked eye twice before but never in this same area or country.  This object could certainly be described as having the broad characteristics of similar UFO.  Observer went out the next evening and ascertained that no such object could be seen in the clear night sky.

The lights appeared to be approximately 200 feet above my house.Then two days ago on June 23rd, 2017 my uncle who lives close by, was standing out on his deck with binoculars, and he said he could see two flying saucer like objects hovering above my house.  One was approximately 50 to 200 feet above he thought and the other was directly above that one, about 500 feet above the roof of my house.  They had red, orange and green lights on them and hovered there for about one hour.  This occurred at about 23:45 again until about 1:30 in the morning.

I didn’t notice it at first, because I was facing my back towards it.  When I looked up I saw what looked like a fireball flying in the sky.  It looked like it was quite far away,  I don’t know how far up or how big it was. It looked like an orange-ish and red circle with flames coming from the top of it.  It flew quite quickly, at first but then it slowed down, the flame also seemed to slowly be dying down, and after it slowly got smaller, it just disappeared, the last bit of flame went out really quick compared to before, it also seemed way too quick for something that was burning to be put out, but I don’t know much about fire so I might be wrong.  It was silent and didn't leave any trace.  It was only there for a short period of time before it disappeared.  I have recorded a few seconds of it, you can’t see a lot and I didn’t record it going out or it changing speed.

The rear of my house faces due north.  I looked up into the sky and saw lightning far off in the distance towards the north.   I then noticed two red balls of light traveling from the west  (approximately along the path of I-70) moving to the east at a fairly rapid speed.At first I thought it might be a helicopter, or two.  As they came closer, I heard no sound from any type of engine.  Two lights travelling the same distance apart in the same path.  Red orange in color, not blinking, but solid the entire time.As they came from the west, about the time they were directly behind my home, the lead light turned due north and appeared to gain altitude, fading from view, possibly behind clouds.  The second light followed the exact same path as the first one, and also disappeared.About two to three minutes later, from the south west of my home, and closer to my home, I saw three additional lights, the exact same appearance as the first two.  The first two were closer together, with the third one trailing a bit behind.   I called my wife out to see what I was seeing, and to bring her cell phone to take pictures.  She arrived, and confirmed that she was seeing what I was seeing.  She tried to take pictures, but they did not turn out very well.Again, the three objects followed the same path of the first two, and turned due north, fading away from my view.   No sound of any engine was ever heard, no other color of light was ever seen other than the red/orange solid light color.At first I thought it might be a Japanese lantern display of some kind, but the objects were moving too fast, and the winds were from the northeast, the opposite direction that the objects were moving.  The two separate groups maintained a distinct separation distance from each other, and equal speed.  Hot air Japanese lanterns would not behave this way.Aircraft routinely fly over our home as they move into the landing pattern for St. Louis Int. Airport Lambert Field.   I know what an aircraft looks and sounds like, and how it behaves.  I do not believe these objects to have been aircraft.I am not a believer in aliens, or UFO’s.

After a minute I realized I left my phone in the house.  So, I ran inside and grabbed it and started to record footage.  Keep in mind, it's night outside and I'm using a phone for video.  It was hard to keep it steady due to the zoom level that I used on top of it being on the completely black background of the sky.  It was making strange sideways and up and down motions, which is hard to tell on the video due to a lack of reference.  I watched it for another 2 minutes then went inside to grab a witness.

1145,"Several strange lights in night skyMy wife and I were heading out to get some late-night ice cream when a string of bright orange-white lights in the sky froze us in our tracks.  The reason I stopped the car was because the lights were so bright, there were so many, and they were moving in a strange way. We both jumped out of the car and I proceeded to run down the street to get a better look.  Six balls of light emerged from behind the tree line at the end of the road and rose together to form a straight line.  Upon closer examination, I could see smaller blinking colored lights on each larger circle of light.  I wouldn’t be able to say exactly how far away they were, but I would guess a few miles.These were not commercial airplanes.  Instead of flying in one path like a plane or helicopter they traveled straight up, in curves, and close together, at times seeming to almost touch, to form patterns. I took a picture that shows three of the lights in a triangle with one light alone at the bottom.  We watched these lights drift away out of view, and when we drove to the end of the street we saw another light rise from the same tree line.I looked up weather balloons online and they don’t look like the lights we saw and don’t move the same way.  I don’t know much about how satellites get into space or if there was any military or government activity that night. I do live near major airports and military bases.One thing is for sure, these lights were very strange and I have never seen anything like it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous; provides no contact information.

We noticed some strange lights to the South South East of our area fairly low in the horizon.  At first we noticed Eight white lights moving slowly up and down separately from each other and within about 1 minute the number had increased to Ten.  This lasted about 10 minutes.  The lights looked to all be individual and moved slowly in an up and down pattern as well in opposite directions.  They also got brighter and dimmer as the event was happening.  The lights appeared to be about 20 to 25 miles in the distance and looked to be over the Prescott Valley to Dewey cities from our position in Paulden.  This was very similar to my report from last week exce! pt the lights appeared to be getting bright to dim much faster.  At approximately 10:05 the lights started to fade and headed in a Southerly  direction and slowly vanished from our view.  I did take a couple of photos with my cell phone camera and I will try to forward with the report.

I noticed that it looked different from an aircraft (we live south of St. Louis airport so airplanes are common and frequent) and had an orange/red glow much like a flame so my first guess was that it could be a hot air balloon.  As it got closer, I tried to listen for the familiar sound of gas burners but was surprised at its total silence.  It soon lost the light and moved to more of a north course as a very dim sphere.  It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.  The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.

1159,"Bright White Sphere Flying Above Street.Our two-story house sits on the north side of a street that goes east/west.  We are directly at the end of a T intersection.  Another street starts at this intersection and goes south.On June 15, 2017, at 19:30 (7:30pm), I was doing some planting in front of the house.  The sky was clear and the sun was nowhere in my line of vision.  Standing, I had turned and was facing a large flat window on the house, about 3.5’ from me.  The window faces south.  Because of the thermal properties of the window, during daylight it is difficult to see anything inside, and everything outdoors is clearly reflected back.  I happened to be looking at the distinction of everything reflected and saw a bright white sphere, approximately 20” in diameter, travel east to west about 35’ directly above our street.  It was traveling about 41 mph, if my calculations are correct.  It did not waver up, down, or side-to-side.  It appeared to be following the street.  There was a slight visual softness about it that I consider to be an aura.  It produced no audible sound.  I turned around to face the street and search the sky to see if it might return.  I’m still standing there one minute later (with the house to my back) when directly above me I see the sphere re-appear about 10’ above my house, going north to south at the same speed as before and again, absolutely no audible sound.  This time, when it gets to where the edge of the street starts in front of the house, without hesitating it dips down about 5’ and continues to fly straight south.  I noticed, instead of flying directly over the road like it did when it went from east to west, it flew about 15’ to the west side of the north/south road and flew just above the tree tops.  There did not appear to be any comet’s-type tail or other lights, only a complete bright white sphere.  I immediately recognized it as being the same type as I had encountered twice previously.This sphere is the same, if not identical, as what I saw and had hit my car while driving on the interstate on August 26, 2016, (3 miles away but also at the same time of day - please see that report) and also on October 22, 2016, (same location as now on the street that intersects with ours but during the night and that one flew south to north and further to the west off the intersecting street – was also witnessed by another person – please see that report).For more than 20 years, we often stargaze at night, watching stars and satellites.

1161,"Witnessed a red pulsing light and what we thought was a white star.This incident occurred in Chula Vista, CA, between 5:00pm and 5:36 pm.  My Daughter and I are in town to assist my Mom after a surgery last week.  My Mom’s Neighbor invited my Daughter and me to take advantage of their swimming pool while she and her Family went out of town to go camping.  So we decided to do just that.  In her yard she has a lounge and as my Daughter and Niece were enjoying the pool I decided to lay on the lounge to relax.  As I was laying in the lounge I noticed a plane flying really high in the sky.  My Mom regularly has planes fly fairly low while waiting to land at Lindbergh Field.  This plane was definitely cruising much faster and much higher than other planes.This was when I noticed a faint white star in the North Eastern sky as I was lying facing North. It was clearly above the plane that flew by.  The star was faint enough to lose the image of the star in the ocean of blue sky in So. Cal if I looked away.  I used a palm tree to pinpoint the faint white star and kept staring at the star because it seemed to elongate then turn into a pinpoint, but I figured it was because I was literally staring at this star in the sky and my eyes were playing tricks on me.I decided to open up my star app on my phone, my Daughter and I love to use it up where we live in Auburn, CA.  The star app showed the tail end of ursa major or ursa minor I don’t quite remember which constellation.  In addition I am not sure if the app was calibrated properly.  Another plane flew by, again high in the sky, but not in the path of the star, which I thought was strange because I first saw the star because of the flight path of the first plane.  Then I considered the current plane is probably flying from a different airport to a different location hence the different location of the star in the sky.I continued to stare at this star when all of a sudden a red round light appeared right next to the star. Appeared is not the correct explanation it faded into view.  This red light pulsed and faded into itself.  The size of the round red light was smaller than the size of a round sewing pin when it was wide open and it disappeared when the pulse collapsed in on itself. I sat and stared at this pulsing light that was way above the next plane that flew by.  It circled around the white star all the while pulsing.At that time I thought I was seeing things.  No way could a red pulsing light be so high up in the sky circling around what I thought was a star.  So I called my 11 year old over and asked her to lay with me.  We use specific words to pinpoint stars in the night sky regularly so I directed her to the faint star in the sky.  She said, “Oh my god Mom!  I’ve never seen a star in the daytime before.  Is that a planet?”  Then she said in a concerned tone.  “Mom, what is that?”  I asked her to describe what she saw.  She said, “What is that pulsing light? Mom? What is that light circling the star?”  She had a little fear in her voice.  I said to her I was not sure what we both were seeing and that I’m glad she saw it too.  We both laid there and watched this pulsing light slowly move around the star one last time and then it moved east.  A tiny little pulsing red light expanding and collapsing in upon itself about 12” to 16” in the sky and then poof.  It was gone.I continued to watch that star for an additional couple of minutes and then I realized.  The faint star had moved North East in the sky about 6” toward the palm tree.  After thinking about this incident for the last couple of days I realized that stars move from East to West in the sky and that star moved East so slowly that I didn’t realize it until after I stopped looking at the star and took one last glance up.

1193,"Stopped to assist several entities.I'm not sure how this fits in but the experience has stayed with me; and I had to post something.I am a long haul driver and was travelling east on Interstate 8, just east of Fortuna, Arizona. Having checked the clock, it was 3:45 AM when I alerted my partner to the presence of three or four individuals standing in the middle of the traffic lane.  After sounding the truck horn, I began to slow our rig.  Given the fact that the area is well known for human smuggling and is dangerous to travel, I wondered if, perhaps, we should keep going.But, when it became apparent that at least three of the individuals were wearing some kind of uniform, I decided to stop along the right shoulder.  Nevertheless, my second driver emerged from the sleeper with the shotgun that we carry.  Both of us agreed that neither of us was going to step from the cab, and we kept the engine idling.Three individuals walked slowly toward me, toward the driver's side of the cab.  At about fifteen feet, I could tell that all three of them were suited, if you will, in some sort of gear. I wondered if the Marines, from the nearby Marine Corps air station, had crashed and were going to ask us for help.As I lowered the driver's window, the shortest of the three, bundled in heavy white gear, with what looked like white armor around the chest, and a partial faceplate that emerged from below the chin, said to me, in perfect English, ""Not to worry, we have a minor situation.""   He (it) motioned with his left arm toward the distance, off the highway.  It was strange because neither my partner nor I saw anything as we approached the group but, sure enough, something was putting out intense red flames, maybe fifty feet off the right shoulder from where we were parked.Before I could say anything, a triangle-shaped wedge of the landscape to our right, with the flames at the base of the triangle, rose up and sliced through the truck cab.  For lack of a better description, I felt like I was looking at some kind of image--as it came through the cab. I mean, the individual who spoke to me appeared first on the left side near me, and then appeared on the right side, the raised side, then on both sides, which appeared raised.My throat was so dry, my stomach in knots; honestly, I felt like I was going to heave. I figured we had it.  Three individuals, two in white, wearing helmets, and one who appeared burned or blackened and without a helmet, appeared in the image to our right, as they made their way around chunks of rock, walking towards our cab.  There was a lot of communication, like radio, between them, or between somebody.The one who had spoken to me, after I had lowered the window, now sounded metallic. So I turned once again towards the voice, to my left again, toward the open window and he (or it) wasn't there.  I turned toward my partner, in the right front seat, who was still cradling the shotgun, nothing. I mean, it was black. It was perfectly silent.  There were no flames off to the right in the distance.Our clock showed 5:15 AM, only the entire encounter felt like it had lasted fifteen minutes or so.  I don't know what to claim.

It went from horizon to horizon directly overhead going from northeast to southwest, and was perfectly straight and still.  It was the same shade of white throughout and about the width of a football field.  I was night fishing on Cherokee Lake when this occurred on a calm, beautiful night.  No other boats or people were visible anywhere due to being late on a Sunday.  After about 10 minutes, the perfect beam started to deform and shift just like a cloud does.  I watched the vapor/mist or whatever it was, slowly get wider and wider, ever so slowly drifting to the north.  After an hour, it looked like a normal huge cloud in the sky.  I was trying to record it and take pictures with my smart phone several times.  All were unsuccessful except on one picture which I took at 22:54.  I zoomed all the way in and got a portion of it on the image.  A straight edge and part of the beam are visible in the picture.

I laid flat on the grass and had amber driving glasses on, in addition to my myopia lenses.  I was looking straight up to the zenith, watching airplanes from LGA airport, etc..  The sun was almost but not quite overhead, and shaded by a leafy branch, so I was able to gaze into the blue without the sun against me.  The clouds were minimal and there was a slight haze and I had a little coffee to drink and was relaxing.  Slowly, but suddenly, like a ghost appearing, there was a distant craft proceeding westward and slightly northward at an angle, slowly creeping.  It had a distinct boxy appearance almost like it had ""solar panels"" on both sides, and there was a faint blinking sidelight hard to make out because of the bright conditions.  It was at the limits of my visual acuity to make out any detail, but it was optical in nature as I was able to play with the image using my fingers in a triangle pinhole lens and saw it refract.  Soon after this, to my right (north), a group of approximately 5 (or more) of the same ""craft"" appeared in a rough and slowly jiggling polygon along with an extra slightly off to one side (""apple"").  This cluster slowly appeared out of nothing, and they too had faint blinking lights.  There was no entry direction, and were ghostly in appearing.  It stayed like this for about 2 minutes and then as if on cue, all of them slowly faded back into nothingness without any abrupt motions.  The lone craft from the beginning was proceeding in its same linear direction and still visible, and then that, too, slowly disappeared in a ghostly fashion.  At the end of this, I checked the sky without the amber lenses and saw that the area where there was the cluster of the craft was blue without clouds and only some haze as it was a hot day.  The lone craft was in an area of very thin cloud.  They did not act like drones and there were too many of them, and they just appeared and disappeared.  They did not get bigger or smaller; there was no noise and they all looked the same.

1232,"Black object with luminescence seen in western sky moving south east.At about 10:15 A.M., I was talking to my neighbor outside on my porch, when I noticed high in the western sky a black orb looking object with luminescence.  I then ran inside and grabbed my camera.  The object was slowly moving south east, but stopped and changed directions several times, even moving north.  There were times when it was not moving at all.  It also seemed to cloak at times and bi-locate once (jump from one space to another) and there may have been a couple other white orbs in the vicinity.  It's hard to describe the shape of this object, and I will let the video footage speak for itself.  It was not a balloon because it was changing directions, stopping, appeared to cloak a few times, and was even motionless at times.  My neighbor and I witnessed these strange aerial phenomena for about twenty minutes.  They just seemed to vanish into thin air and disappeared out of site.  I was unable to capture on video the other orbs because there were no background clouds for reference, so I couldn't see them in my camera.  I was astonished at what I was seeing.  The object just seemed to vanish in thin air as it was heading north.  I have two video clips.  The one with me talking is at normal speed.  It is quite shaky, because I did not have a tripod.

1240,"Observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, at a high rate of speed.On the night of June 9th, 2017 at around 11:30 PM,  I observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, and travel in straight line toward the South East at a very high rate of speed until out of sight.I was home and in bed when one of the dogs decided he needed to go outside, so I got up and took him out to the back yard. The sky was clear and so I paused to gaze at the stars.  I usually hope to see a meteor or a satellite drift by.  But that night, I looked straight up and immediately saw a very bright light moving what seemed to be just above a 60' tree behind me.  I wasn’t sure what it was, but as I watched, 3 lights in the shape of an equilateral triangle slowly came into full view directly above me.The lights were bright, white, and steady (not strobes), however, they seemed to have a shimmering, star-like quality to them.  My first thought was that someone was flying a drone over our house, but it seemed odd, since I’ve never seen any drones flying in our neighborhood, and it was a bit late at night.The second thing I noticed was the absence of any sound — it was totally silent.  I remember thinking that it all seemed very odd, and if a drone was flying possibly only 100 feet above me, I would have easily heard the buzzing sound of the motors/rotors.Watching it, I felt a sense of awe; although it was also slightly disorienting since it was hard to tell exactly how large the formation was, or what the true elevation was.  They seemed to be moving very fast, maintaining a uniform triangular formation, and moved at a consistent speed in a straight South-Easterly direction over the house and yard.  It took less than 15 seconds until they were out of sight — which would be several miles away.I live outside the city lights in a dark suburban area, on top of a hill so I can see well above the tree line to the South.  I had a clear view of the lights during the entire observation, they didn’t disappear behind trees or clouds and I watched them as far as the eye can see.  I’ve observed balloons, meteors, satellites, jets, helicopters and small airplanes, but this triangle of lights was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.Finally, about 4 days after my observation, I mentioned this to a friend who also lives in the neighborhood.  He remarked that around that time, he and his wife were out for a walk when a bright light went overhead (his first thought was that it was drone) followed by other lights that seemed to come from the side and “join up” with the lead lights. They said they looked like bright stars, but they moved very quickly through the sky as a group.About one month later, I asked him if he could remember exactly when and what he saw.  His response shocked me.  He said he would “check his phone” to look at the “date on the photos”.  Turns out he has about 7 photos and a very short (3 second) video.  I’ve reviewed the photos, and they show at least 2 groups of triangular lights, and perhaps a 3rd or 4th group further in the distance.  My friend prefers to remain anonymous, so unfortunately, I can’t attach the photos/video.I’ve never witnessed anything like this, and felt the need to report it.  Any help in understanding what was seen here would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, my friend and I are both employed as software developers.",Duration:<15 seconds,"Location: Ann Arbor, MI",Occurred : 6/9/2017 23:30  (Entered as : 06/09/17 23:30),Posted: 8/4/2017,Reported: 7/27/2017 2:48:41 PM 14:48,Shape: Triangle

1242,"UFO Report 06/09/2017.  On Friday, June 9, 2017, my two friends and were at Smokemont Campground just outside Cherokee, NC, in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  We were not staying there, but had driven there from a neighboring town where we live, specifically to see the synchronized fireflies event that happens in late May, or early April, every year.We parked and decided to walk along the path along the creek to first see the “glow worms” that my friends discovered the year before in the root bank of a tree up the hill that had a small spring in it.  Tiny glow worms, but they're nonetheless, cool.We walked back to the campground, found the darkest spot away from the camp fires, set up our chairs, and waited for the show (synchronized fireflies event).  The turnout was low, probably because it was cool, and there was a full moon (strawberry moon, in fact).I had just gotten back from a short walk down the road, and when I returned, I noticed that my friends were looking up at something in the sky.  Naturally, I looked up and there in the sky was a white glowing object, seemed to be round in shape.  At first it looked like a giant firefly but it was too high up in the sky.  The first thing I noticed, was there were no blinking lights like an airplane.  It continued in a line, then stopped, then moved forward, then seems to turn on its side like a tire rolling down a road and disappeared.  The whole encounter lasted 20-40 seconds.  There was no sound and I would have expected a sound since it was that close to us.  The time was around 10:30 pm.Two of us early saw the object stop and hover.We left and the park and headed home.  On the way, several cars were stopped in both directions, and we could see an elk on the side of the road.  We thought that was all that there was but as we passed, we saw an elk calf was down in the road, likely hit by a car.  Being that we were from the area and the others were likely tourists, my friend called her friend that works in the park to determine who we should call about the incident.  He stated that park officers patrol all hours and that they would know in short order.  I am adding this one detail for one reason.  When my friend told her friend on the phone that we had seen what seemed to be a UFO, he then relayed a similar experience that he and a coworker had in the park just last Saturday.  He described a white object that moved through the night sky, then stopped and moved again, etc.I am a 57 year-old female.  I have never seen or reported a UFO.

The object moved silently and slowly from the west towards the full moon in a flight path directly over my campsite.

1250,"Drone-like sphere follows airplane in clear afternoon sky, then veers slowly away, before vanishing.At my apartment complex, I had just walked out to toss trash in a dumpster, when I heard, and then saw, a Cessna model 172 flying in an Easterly direction, above the trees and housing area nearby.  The sky was blue, and without any clouds.  The Cessna flew at an altitude that suggested it would land at nearby Fullerton airport.  It was perhaps about one quarter mile south of my location.Just a moment after looking at the Cessna airplane, I noticed a mostly round shaped object, about one third the length of the Cessna in size, was flying just slightly higher and behind the Cessna plane.  The object was colored mainly white and black, and had a single and very bright white light near its top that flashed regularly, like a beacon or strobe.The object flew on at a slower speed than the Cessna, and I followed it for about one minute as it flew farther away and farther South than the track the Cessna had taken.  When the object was then just a tiny point in the clear sky, it suddenly just vanished.  I watched for another minute or so, but it never came back.The best thing I can compare the object to would be the flying ‘drone balls’ that are in the Tom Cruise Science-Fiction film called “Oblivion”.  The object flew and looked much like those round drones in that movie, though I estimate it to have been much larger in size than those in the film were.  Maybe the size of a Smart Car or Fiat 500.I believe whatever this object was, that it was a remotely controlled vehicle.  Whether it was of an alien origin, or a secret military device, I can only speculate at this point.

1266,"My wife ((wife's name deleted)) was standing on our deck (south facing) and called me as she was wondering what a single reddish globe light in the sky was.  The object came from the south (from Westfield/Eden direction) and traveled towards us.  As the object neared, a second object (same color) appeared from the same direction.  Shortly thereafter, a third object appeared.  They appeared to be ‘globes’ and moved in a somewhat fast rate of speed.  There was no noise.  Their movement was very ‘smooth’ (no quick movements).Object 1 traveled towards us and, at one point, began ascending straight up (it disappeared).  Objects 2 and 3 passed the house (to our left look at the objects).  As they passed, I noticed what appeared to be a single light (underneath) the object.  I could make out a black shape (outline from the light) but could not distinguish what it was.  That is, they flew low enough for me to see that it did not have a bank of lights.I am confident in saying that it was not a plane as I did not see wings.  The light was bright and did not flicker or pulse.  I have seen and heard drones when deployed to Afghanistan.  This was not, in my opinion, a drone.I am forwarding a picture captured of object 2 and 3 from our deck.  I have other pictures but the size of the file would be too big to email.

I was watching a UFO documentary because, back in May, I had creepy dreams about being abducted by ufos and kept waking up to my window glowing Green light, and feeling a sense of sleep paralysis.  My window would also sometimes containing a bunch of computerized 0s and 1s, so I was doing my own version of ""research"" haha.  At first I  got nervous, and tried to use deduction to figure out whether it was simply a plane, a rocket, a weather balloon, or something unidentified, but then it began to act strange.  It stayed still for a good amount of minutes, which I couldn't make sense of, but took the opportunity to take a picture anyways with my phone (my hands shook out of nervousness so it came out looking odd instead of orb shaped).  All of a sudden though I saw some blinking planes (I assume they were planes) heading towards it, about two of them at first, and the orange orb started moving DIRECTLY UPWARDS.  Not diagonal, just upwards, which made me think of a rocket for a second.  That's when I took my phone again and started recording it, but my hands kept moving and I was breathing hard out of nervousness so that also came out bad.  Eventually it passed the planes, went over my house and when I stood outdoors, I noticed it no longer looked orange, but instead, was hard to see and blinking.  Then it went over the trees and vanished, followed by 4 planes.  Once it went over my house I took like 7-10 secs to get outside so it could've vanished then and afterwards what I saw blinking was one of the now 4 planes following the same direction, but I don't know what to make of it.

Perhaps 10-15 miles away from viewer.  Objects spotted and perhaps 10 mins total observation.  Speculation the objects were there before viewer spotted them initially.  Objects initially appear to be somehow connected as they undulated together in the sky as if they were connected, but later one of the objects broke pattern with the other two and did its own maneuver and then returned to the other two, and then the three of them continued maneuvers together.   Due to the undulating pattern, it is not thought they were just one object such as a dark plane with three lights (since one did separate from the two and then later rejoin) since the viewer has witnessed planes heading to or from DEN as the viewer knows the flight path over e! ast of Parker Road and basically down E-470 to DEN.  Objects went higher in elevation, lower in elevation, east, west, north, and south – moving further away and then closer in several different patterns, some looping, some more block-style in nature.  Ball lightening ruled out since ball lightening doesn’t last this long.  Total movement from time noticed until they disappear into the passing storm that was hitting Aurora area at this time was maybe 10-30 miles.  This seems too far for a controlled drone or drones and drones don’t seem to be able to fly in unison like objects.  Drones also don’t seem to have such bright lights as object were maybe 10-15 miles away.  Objects did not appear to be metallic, but some kind of darker material, so doesn’t resemble photos seen of weather balloons, and weather balloons don’t seem to have lights or ones that were so bright as the objects did.  Objects were making various loops, appearing to stop in mid-air, rapidly going from left/right (West/East) but were generally following either an Easterly or North-Easterly direction.  During this same time, a large storm with hail, rain and lightning was passing from West to East north of the viewers position with the objects between the viewer and the storm.  If this was under human control, why were these maneuvers being carried out extremely close to a monster of a storm?  The viewer cannot think of any plane, drone, etc that can make such maneuvers.  iPhone 6 video was captured (2 min 45 sec) in zoomed in mode.  No rain at time.  Video shows birds flying around and trees for perspective.  Video is a bit shaky.  There was no water on the camera since it was not raining yet when the video was taken.  Viewers voice can be heard on video wondering what they are.  Objects were seen by viewers eyes and captured on video.  Still images are taken from the captured video since the video is somewhat shaky.",Duration:5-10 minutes,"Location: Parker/Aurora, CO",Occurred : 6/7/2017 16:45  (Entered as : 07/07/2017 16:45),Posted: 6/9/2017,Reported: 6/8/2017 12:33:31 PM 12:33,Shape: Formation
1281,"I was driving on a very clear day, without a single cloud in the sky.  At an intersection, I noticed a silver object in the sky, which i presumed to be a very low flying 747 which struck me to be odd as I was 60 to 70 plus miles away from Ohare and Midway airports.  Looking at it closer, I noticed it was not moving.  I took off my sunglasses to see if I could see it better, but as soon as I did, that it disappeared.  Putting them back on, you could easily see it again.  I figured this was related to the polarized lens....very weird though. I immediately changed my direction to head north towards it.  Driving very fast, I was only about 2 miles from the object that was only about 3,000 feet in the air.  I had never seen anything like this in my life.  As I got closer the object began to move.  At this time, I immediately felt light headed and a headache ensued (which I rarely get...related idk).  At the same moment hundreds of birds began to flock away from the object from the adjacent tree line.  It changed its direction a few times and began to head north.  I hopped on I-57 towards Chicago and drove very fast so I would not lose sight of it.  As I did this, the craft picked up incredible speeds towards increased altitude dramatically.  If I had to guess, roughly 15 times faster than a typical 747, but this is likely an underestimate.  I was dumbfounded, concluding the only explanation is new military technology or extraterrestrial.  Unfortuantely, the object moved so fast that it disappeared in the distance in less than 30 to 45 seconds.  I decided I would turn around at the next exit at this point as it was long gone.  I slowed down a bit because I noticed an unmarked all black police car flashing white, yellow, red, and blue lights pulled off on the side of the interstate.  I could not identify the model, as it was a car I had never seen before, and I know my cars very well.  I would say the closest car would be a Chrysler 300 with a sleek body kit, maybe it's the 2018 version.  Who knows.  As I approached it, I noticed it had US Government plates, with no other vehicles pulled over next to it, and I could not see into the windows as I passed, they were tinted which striked me as odd.  I thought it might be related to the presence of the craft so I kept driving past the next exit.  I continued on the expressway for another 10 to 12 miles to see if anything odd would appear.  As I began to merge into the right lane to get off the expressway I saw it again...maybe 10 miles West of me hovering above a radio tower.  At this point I tried to snap a photo, but figured it would not work as I could not see the object without my polarized lens.  I got off the freeway and headed west towards the object which was likely above Frankfort, IL.  At this point I noticed a prop plane heading towards it from the east and two dark planes flying in formation from the north.  At this point I was only a few miles away from it, but as the jets approached the craft it accelerated south at a very high speeds.  The best pa! rt was the fact you could see it breaking the sound barrier within a matter of a few seconds.  It picked up speeds so fast and headed into the skies where I lost sight of it within 10 seconds. I pulled off the road to turn around and see what types of planes where approaching.  They were two fighter jets, maybe the F35 but I couldn't say definitely.  They had no chance of keeping up with the object though.  I hopped back on the freeway and on my way back home I noticed a strong presence of police cars.  I saw 15-20 in the 20 minute drive home. As I approached my town I noticed more police lights, a fire truck, and ambulance which was weird because it was right where I began to have a headache.  There was a car in the ditch on one side of the road and two cars that collided at the intersection.  Maybe it was just all a coincidence though, but it was very odd coincidence.  I reviewed the photos I took and I managed to capture the object on one of them, which I will upload. I watched the six o'clock news to see if anyone else reported it, but no news at all regarding craft, military testing, fighter jets, etc.  Hoping someone will see this post and possibly confirm some of these events.  Lastly, I have been keeping an eye out for an odd activity over the last few days.  I noticed a strange, constant light that traveled much faster than the any of the other planes that fly over my house the night after the initial sighting.  Additionally, I worked outside the day after and today on the landscaping.  I kept hearing roaring jet engines over the house. This occured 6 or 7 times since I saw the object on thd 7th.  Unfortunately, it has been cloudy here since then, but I can only confirm that I saw a fighter jet on two of these occasions during the day.  I've lived hear since 2004 and have only seen a fighter jet once so all of this is very odd.  Hope someone else can provide an explanation.  Thanks.  Note: the attached photo is the original unedited photo.  It has the object on the right side, if you zoom on you can see the radio tower in the distance 10 to 15 miles away or so.  It is directly above the radio tower.",Duration:30 minutes,"Location: Manteno, IL",Occurred : 6/7/2017 15:00  (Entered as : 06/07/2017 15:00),Posted: 6/15/2017,Reported: 6/9/2017 10:50:46 PM 22:50,Shape: Disk

1283,"Daylight object in close proximity to Sky Harbor AirportI was operating a sound system (mics and speakers) for the groundbreaking of a new Valley Metro light rail station at 50th St. and Washington in Phoenix, serving the Ability 360 Center.  This location is almost exactly one mile from the eastern end of the north runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, runway 26.  The event was taking place on the roof of the three story facility.  There is a shade structure running along the north and west portions of the roof.  A 20'x20' canopy had been erected to provide shade for the guests.  My position was near the northeast corner of the roof where I had a small audio mixing board set up.  At that time aircraft were departing Sky Harbor to the east, from the north runway, passing less than a half-mile from my position.	The event had begun at 8am with the Phoenix Mayor discussing details of the project.  At 8:20am, I noticed an object come into my field of view from the north, just above the Mayor's position at the podium, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.  It was elongated in the horizontal direction, reflective or very light in color.  I could not judge distance, but felt that it might be about a mile away, based on having witnessed countless aircraft approaching Sky Harbor.  I appeared to be similar in size to a small FedEx single engine turboprop aircraft which utilize Sky Harbor.  Its altitude was lower than that of an aircraft crossing over, so I immediately assumed it was making an approach, but it should have been much further west if that were the case.  I could not detect any vertical structure such as a tail, the reflective brilliance made it difficult to make out details.	It continued south for a short distance then suddenly either came to a complete stop or made an immediate “jog” toward the west.  At this point the idea of “drone” popped into my mind, but the apparent distance to the object made it questionable if a drone would be that visible.  The other reason to reject the drone theory was the proximity to Sky Harbor.  The object then continued making a fairly rapid arc toward the southeast, again with an immediate acceleration which seemed very “drone like.”  I lost sight of it behind the canopy until it emerged southwest of my position.  It appeared to be following the departure path of  runway 25, the center runway, toward the east, but more rapidly than a traditional aircraft. I continued to observe it for another 10 seconds until it moved behind a large structure on the roof.  I moved to the other side of the structure but I did not see the object again.	I could not detect any noise from the object, at least nothing which I could hear above the traffic on Washington Street and the PA system I was operating.  The movement was unlike normal aircraft in the sudden acceleration and deceleration.  The object's altitude seemed constant.	Based on the flight path I observed I would dismiss any thought of it being an actual drone.  My immediate reaction was thinking “how bold” to venture into the departure path of Sky Harbor in broad daylight.  I have almost 40 years of working in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and am very familiar with aircraft and aircraft operations.  This object did not operate by normal flight standards.",Duration:40 seconds,"Location: Phoenix, AZ",Occurred : 6/7/2017 08:20  (Entered as : 06/07/17 08:20),Posted: 6/22/2017,Reported: 6/19/2017 3:05:11 PM 15:05,Shape: Other
1284,"Red glowing object flying by on a cloudy night.About 2 weeks ago I was looking through my bedroom window around midnight.  The sky was completely covered with clouds.  Around 23:55 I saw a red light in the sky moving from the north-east to the south.  Thinking it was just a plane, I didn't really pay much attention to it.  Until I noticed it was impossible for a plane to be visible because of the cloudy weather and the red light didn't flinch like those of a plane would.  Because I'm an amateur astronomer, I grabbed by binoculars as fast as I could.  When I was back at the window with my binoculars the object was already halfway, so in the east direction.  When I looked at the object I still had no idea what it was.  It looked like an egg shaped object with a red light in it.  Because it was very cloudy, I guess the light must have been very bright.  Because no other objects were seen (stars, planes, ...)  The object suddenly vanished and was never seen again.  I discussed this sighting with others, but no one come up ! with an answer to what it could be.  After searching on the web, I found similar pictures of red objects in the sky.  One of the which looked the most to what I've seen was also in Belgium and also around midnight.

1286,"VIDEO PROOF - Bright star looking object heads straight twords me, directly overhead, then leaves - video on YoutubeMy and I were fishing right after sun down when we started to look up into the sky and saw a star looking object very far off zooming across the sky.  Then suddenly, a bright star looking object at a closer distance, in the opposite direction appeared to be getting bigger and was approaching us.  Immediately I started video-taping the object as it came right over head, hovering for a few seconds, then abruptly changed course.  It went past a star in the sky and then got smaller and smaller disappearing a few minutes later.  The object appeared to be changing in brightness and even color in a slight manner.  The object was much closer to us than the video made it seem, and it made no noise when it was overhead, which made me nervous.  This took place at the Beavertail Pond out-side of Missoula, Montana.

As there was no proper perspective, the lights could have been far away or maybe as close as five miles.  This is an unknown.  The lights were as bright as headlights and white in color.  (The other witness thought they were ""yellowish"".)  They appeared to be moving slowly from south to north together as a unit so I assumed they were one object.  The lights faded, blinked out, or shut off in a few seconds.  I have witnessed many flare drops but they last much longer than five seconds.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))No, Peter, I have seen many, many military flare drops.  At first, I thought this was possible but the sighting was too short of duration for flares.  Flares last many minutes.  The lights appeared before us on the higway and disappeared in 3-5 seconds.  Also, the location (in or about the north Salton Sea area) is not a usual military training ground.  However as you suggested, they could have been farther away, perhaps over the Chocolate Mts., which IS a restricted govt ""bombing range.""  Still, the short duration and the appearance that they were traveling south to north makes me dismiss that.The other witness says that I posted the wrong time.  She said it was more like 8:15 pm, not 9:15, as I reported.  That could be correct.  She also assumed that they were over Font's Point, a spot about 5-7 miles from our observation site, but I informed her of the perspective issue.  We just could no tell.  Five miles, or 25 miles?I also have some experience with viewing sky divers, as our airport (Borrego Valley) hosts the Canadian Army paratroopers twice per year.  They specialiize in night jumping, BUT they do it to practice in the dark.  THEY do not use flares.  They are all about surprising the ""enemy.""  As I said there were 6-8 lights in a straight row.  Unlikley that jumpers could execute this so perfectlyI researched the local news, MUFON, and the web in general, and have yet to see another report coinciding with mine.  I also have a small ad hoc group of local buffs.  We call ourselves the Dessert UFO Group, DUG.  No members reported anything.  I assume that you did not get a second report of this?

It was not pulsating or blinking at all but it seems as it was in the shape of the sputnik satellite, I can say the craft was not the space station because I have seen the space station in many occasions and it did not look anything like it but also it was traveling at a lesser speed than the space station.The shape was not completely round but kind of oval and the two (I will call it probes) for a lack of a better word,  Probes that had in the front also were shining with the whole craft; I was able to look at it for about two minutes and then could not see more because a tree line got on my way.What I will like to find out is if anyone else was able to see this that day??

1319,"""Fireball"" ufo sighted over west edge of Elk River, MN, for 4-5 minutes, starting at 11:20PM on June 3rd, 2017.June 3rd, 2017 @ 11:20PM.  The 2 Witnesses (Father & Daughter) were traveling westbound on County Road 30, on the west edge of Elk River, Minnesota, just over 1-2 miles before the city border line between Elk River & Big Lake.  Upon crossing the 4-way stop intersection of Joplin Street & County Road 30, the unidentified object suddenly appeared in our view  (where the speed limit picks up from the 30mph zone before the intersection, to a 45mph zone after the intersection).  The object appeared suddenly in the wide open clear sky, at a 1 o'clock position from our westbound direction of travel.  The object would be best described as a VERY BRIGHT ORANGE ""fireball"" without a discernible shape, surrounded in a wavering BRIGHT orange ""aura.""  The object was very low in the sky, as the few trees we passed along the north (right) hand side of County Road 30 initially obscured our view somewhat.  I would estimate the altitude of the object to have been no more than 200-300 feet off the ground at the *very* most.County Road 30 runs east/west parallel, next to and along the Mississippi river along that stretch, on the north hand side of the Mississippi river.  Distance from the intersection of Joplin&30, to the Pinewood Golf Course on Waco Street NW, is between 1-2 miles.  When the ""fireball"" suddenly appeared it was only that distance ahead of us, just a bit north of the golf course, almost directly over top of Highway 10. Highway 10 also runs the same parallel east/west as County Road 30 and the Mississippi river, just a few blocks north of County Road 30.A little more than half way from the Joplin/30 intersection to the Waco/30 intersection, is the Sherburne County Government Center to our right (north), located along the south side of Highway 10.By the time we had traveled (1 mile) westbound on County Road 30, and were directly south of the Sherburne County Government Center (which was directly to our right, north) the object had already slowly and erratically moved a little southward and was now right over the golf course on Waco Street NW.  We could clearly see the ""fireball"" had been moving southward, and was continuing to move southward.  However, the object did NOT move at a steady speed.  Instead, it was moving only a little south at a time at random intervals, stopping periodically in the sky.  Also, with each southward movement, it randomly would travel to a somewhat higher and sometimes lower altitude in the sky. (Note: County Road 30 along that stretch is perfectly straight for a few miles, and perfectly flat. NO rises or falls in the road.)  When we reached Waco Street, we turned onto Waco, and I immediately stopped the car to view the object which was nearly above us at that point.  We clearly observed from the roadside stopped as the object continued its random erratic traveling southward in short movements changing altitude up & down also with each movement, for just shy of 2 more minutes.  Also, throughout the duration of the sighting the ""fireball"" somewhat randomly increased and decreased in brightness.  Each time it moved mostly the brightness increased. Each time it paused in the sky mostly the brightness decreased.  All the while it maintained being the absolutely brightest object by *far* in the entire sky, other than the moon of course which was to the south (left) of us.Then the object, after being viewed from our stopped position at Waco & 30 for nearly 2 minutes, suddenly vanished, as instantly as it had appeared in the first place.  At the time it finally disappeared in the clear open sky, it had traveled southward enough to had crossed over the Mississippi river to the south side of the river.  From beginning to end, from Joplin/30 intersection to the time it disappeared south of the river, the entire sighting had lasted between 4-5 minutes.",Duration:4-5 minutes,"Location: Elk River, MN",Occurred : 6/3/2017 23:20  (Entered as : 06/03/17 23:20),Posted: 6/9/2017,Reported: 6/4/2017 11:18:57 AM 11:18,Shape: Fireball

It was a  black oblong flying/hovering object,  moving all directions, it would stop, go straight, then go sideways...then stopping and flying again, it would go stright up and down.  It would fly straight then take wide curves.  It would just take a 90 degree turns at a high speed and also straight 90 degree turns going up and down as well.  Very odd flight pattern for a blimp.  No wings.  Broad day light very high in the sky just below the clouds.  It appeared as of it were skimming just under the clouds.

Around 23:55 I  saw a red light in the sky moving from the north-east to the south.  Thinking  it was just a plane, I didn't really pay much attention to it, until I noticed it was impossible for a plane to be visible because of the cloudy  weather and the red light didn't flinch like those of a plane would.  Because I'm an amateur astronomer, I grabbed by binoculars as fast as I could.  When I  was back at the window with my binoculars, the object was already halfway, so in the east direction.  When I looked at the object I still had no idea what  it was.  It looked like an egg shaped object with a red light in it.  Because  it was very cloudy, I guess the light must have been very bright.  Because no  other objects were seen (stars, planes, ...)  The object suddenly vanished  and was never seen again.  I discussed this sighting with others, but no one  come up with an answer to what it could be.  After searching on the web, I found  similar pictures of red objects in the sky.  One of the which looked the most  to what I've seen was also in Belgium and also around midnight.

Then shortly before she left, she looked and noticed it was gone.  Yet the Big Dipper was still visable in the general area which dispelled the idea of it being a planet.

The military does navigate their satellites, they can change direction, never in the way you see in the video.

1352,"Bright light bigger than Venus, bobbing around in the southern sky at sunset for several minutesI am a retired medical assistant. Last evening, I was taking photos of the sunset from the end of our property, along the county road.  Upon turning around to walk back to the house, I noticed the moon just up over the trees across the road, so took a photo of that as well.  This has become a routine for me to do after I let the dogs out and give their meds, each night at 9.  It is also part of my exercise strategy to lose weight by doing something fun.  As I continued to walk home, I noticed immediately- a very bright light straight south in the sky, under 45 degrees or so (I am not the best at calculating that). and guessing it to be under 5 miles away.  At first I figured it was a plane going to the small airport a bit more to the West.  However, the lights did not change direction, there were no red or green ones visible to me like they typically have, it was too big to be a plane, and there was no noise.  Then I noticed it was bobbing around a little, l! ike a pulsation type movement.  My next thought was that it was Venus rising, but thought I surely would have noticed it while letting the dogs out before, and it seemed a lot bigger than a planet or a star.  A sudden excitement came over me as I realized this was most likely some sort of UFO!  For about 3 minutes I stood in wonder watching it, until I remembered I had my camera in my hand, so I took a quick photo.

1354,"Cloaking aircraft seen in Arden Hills, Mn.I was driving to work this morning, heading south on 35 W, taking the Hwy. 10 east exit to the Hwy. 96 exit.  At the stoplights there, I saw what looked like a typical jet airplane heading over the Hwy. 10 bridge in a northeast direction.  Today was a perfectly clear day with no clouds in the vicinity.  The craft appeared for maybe 5 seconds and then vanished out of sight.  This is the third time that I have seen a cloaking aircraft in the past two years.  Because of past sightings, if I see a flash in the sky I pay attention and do not assume it is a 'regular' airplane.  Frankly, I think there would be more reports on these sightings, if people only would pay attention.  I believe most people are desensitized to air traffic and a prime example of this was about a year ago while at a stoplight on Co. Rd. C and 35 E around 3pm, a black hawk helicopter was so low to the ground that you could feel its breeze.  Everyone around me in thier cars just sat there as if it was a normal day in the neighborhood.

1368,"Lights inside and outside with scratching noises.I was camping on my land in Birch Tree, Missouri.  I was asleep in the RV, it was 1:45 AM, Tuesday May 30, 2017, when I was suddenly awake.  I did not know immediately why I had woke up, but as I lay there, looking out of the window I noticed a very large, very bright star above the trees.  It was about four times larger than the other stars and bright like a stadium light.I had all the windows and blinds open that night to allow the breeze to keep me cool.  I watched the “star” thinking that I had never seen one so brilliant before, and suddenly four lights came out of the “star.”  I watched, stunned, as these four lights began blinking or pulsing and flew around the early morning sky.  The large light, which I had thought a star, stayed higher in the sky, but the four pulsating lights flew lower, closer to the ground.  The where perhaps 100 feet or so above the earth.  They were whitish in color, not as bright as the original but they were blinking or pulsating, not sure how to describe it, and flying not randomly but back and forth like they were searching.I was paralyzed with fear, not wanting them to know that I was there.  Suddenly, in a fraction of a second, everything around me flashed very bright then dark again.  I quietly get up and close all the windows and blinds, hoping to go unnoticed to the four flying “orbs.”  They were not really round, rectangle box shaped with rounded corners.  I laid back down, so I could peak under the curtains and that is when I noticed the blinking round light inside of my RV.I was really doubting my own eyes at this point. It was above me in the corner of the RV.  I was hoping that there was a hole in the roof.  I looked around me and everything inside was very dark except the glowing round light in the corner of the ceiling in the RV.This whole thing had been going on for about twenty minutes.  I was more frightened than I could ever remember.  I felt helpless against these lights.  That is when the RV moved, I was hoping a bear had pushed against it.  Then I heard the clawing and scratching coming from the left rear (across from the round light).  I was again hoping that it was a bear, armadillo or very large mice trying to get in.I finally just snapped out of my motionless state and grabbed one of the headlamps that I had close by and turned it on.  The round pulsing light was gone, the noise stopped and everything appeared normal.  I at 2:00 AM telling them what I was seeing.  My mind fought to find rational reasons for what was going on.  I turned the light back out around 2:30 and laid back down. I peeked under the curtain and saw the large “star” still in the sky.  The round light that was inside my RV did not return neither did the scratching noises.I had my two cats with me, one of them hid and the other stayed with me and was very nervous.I have no Idea what time I finally fell asleep.

The plane instantly became a red glowing orb and was doing a figure 8 pattern behind the tree in front of me, it would drop down heading west then pull up and around and head east over the top of the tree where I could see it.  It did this a couple of times - then as it was heading west again above the tree it stopped dead! in front of me.  I couldn't move, a part of me thought to run inside but my body wouldn't move.

They looked like stars but it was still a little early and light out to see stars.  They meandered slowly and oddly and gave off constant light so we knew it wasn't aircraft from Luke air force base.  They moved like nothing I've ever seen.  They headed east towards a bright star or close planet perhaps -east by north east- before they disappeared out of view.  It lasted about 10 minutes from when I first noticed them.,Duration:12 minutes,"Location: El Mirage, AZ",Occurred : 5/28/2017 20:00  (Entered as : 05/28/17 20:00),Posted: 6/2/2017,Reported: 5/28/2017 9:22:58 PM 21:22,Shape: Light
1383,"Pictures of Unidentified Flying Object over Malibu 05/28/2017I arrived at the Venice Beach boardwalk in the Los Angeles area to pick up my lovely lady Annette at approximately 6:50 p.m.(PST) and as I walked up to the boardwalk where I was going to meet her, I also looked around absorbing the beaches scenery and greeted her with hug.  I looked North towards the Santa Monica pier from where we were and I thought to myself what a beautiful sunset.  I'm not a big social media guy but I like posting pictures of scenery and places so I decided to post one that moment.  I stepped up with my phone and tried to focus on placing the beach, sun, and mountains as the primary objects in the shot.  I took a the first picture and quickly glanced at the result on my phones screen, immediately realizing that there was a shiny aqua colored spot in my photo, I quickly assumed it was a reflection spot of some sort.  In my mind I wasn't too satisfied with my picture so between the glance at picture 1st, and tapping the phone to zoom in a l! ittle closer, it took me approximately 8-10 seconds to take the 2nd picture later from the original shot.  As we drove home I told Annette to check out the picture I had posted on social media and I handed her my cell phone.  Immediately she pointed out the aqua sphere in the first picture to me as I drove, and without looking at it or skipping a beat I said to her, ""I know it must be a glare or something,"" while I said that she had shuffled to the second picture and quickly replied. ""the shiny spot's, on the two different pictures, and in two different locations?""   We stopped and zoomed in on the phones screen and to our amazement there were also multiple sphere's within this electric blue sphere.  The picture also captured the glowing spheres reflection in the sky.",Duration:,"Location: Malibu, CA",Occurred : 5/28/2017 18:53  (Entered as : 052817 18:53),Posted: 6/2/2017,Reported: 5/28/2017 11:41:14 PM 23:41,Shape: Sphere

After watching for several minutes I noticed there was a larger BRIGHT object and 5 smaller objects and the smaller ones were moving rather erratically.  I mentioned it to my GF who also confirmed that she saw it.  While she was watching I went inside and brought out my binoculars to get a closer look.  They were very high in the sky.At this point, 2 of the 5 smaller craft had left the area, but 3 of the smaller ones were still there.  The larger bright object had left also.  Once we had the binoculars, we could see that the 3 smaller objects that were moving in what resembled figure 8 patterns but still very erratic, were circular.

1412,"String of oval shaped lights circle each other to form a larger craft.I looked out my bedroom window at around 10:30 PM Friday, May 26th, 2017, to see a large series of lights rotating counter clockwise.  It appeared as though the lights were forming a very large circular craft.  There appeared to be a secondary craft about half the size of the first rotating in the opposite direction than the original series of lights and hovering adjacent.  I ruled out search lights as the sky was very cloudy, and no streaks of lights indicating a ground level light were seen, just large pull shaped lights slowly circling.  There was no sound to be heard.  The phenomenon lasted an hour and a half after I had originally seen it through my window, there is no telling whether or not it had started earlier.  At 12:00 midnight I returned to the window to check on the position of the lights and they had completely disappeared without a trace.  Another thing worth nothing: during the time that the lights were visible, three conventional aircrafts were heard.  I heard one helicopter, and two planes.  I live close to Logan Airport, commercial flights are very common to see and hear, but the two planes sounded distinctly louder and were only breifly heard.

1413,Bright white light moving really fastI woke up at about 3:00 in the morning was sitting in bed {with the window open to get some fresh air} looking at my tablet when a bright white light in the sky caught my attention and I remember thinking what the hell is that because it was too bright (I would say 3x as bright} to be a plane and it had no other flashing lights on it so I got up and went to the window to get a better look and realized this thing is scooting along pretty well it was hauling ass for a plain.When I first saw the light {my window faces south} it was traveling from the west heading east you know California to New York and as soon as It was almost above me it started heading south-east for about 5 seconds and then turned south heading away from me until it diapered behind some clouds.  It travelled that distance in about 30 seconds.  I realize now that the brightness of the light never changed even when it was traveling away from me and only dimed when it went behind some clouds.  I live near an airport and see planes come and go all the time.  I used to work at that airport and so what I am saying is I think I know planes fairly well.  What I saw was definitely not a commercial airliner.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous; provides no contact information.

1416,One main object moving all over the place eventually seemed to release two smaller objects.Went outside to take the dogs out- super clear night.  Saw a bright light going really fast from the west to the east.  The craft stopped abruptly and started coming back from west to east.  It then stopped again and was zig zagging all over.  The lights would get really bright then dim.  We could almost see a tail of some sort coming from behind or around it.  At one point it got really bright and two smaller lights shot out of it!  Those lights moved in a straight direction and then came back circling around the main craft/ object. It seemed to have a spot light coming off it at different times.  The movement was sporadic- it's almost as if its the beginning it was heading for a destination and then it got there and stopped and several different things happened.

SW at a steady speed faster than any satellite would ever move,-  as it sailed across the night sky.  That led me to notice the same bright light in the NW Sky that seems to pivot at times  and always noticeably brighter than any other light on any given clear night.  I mentioned it to A fiend of mine I had just met.  She pulled out her new phone & began recording video of the bright light I had been observing & taking pics & video of over the last 6-9mts.  My camera didn't pick up on all the other  light activity going on around the bright object..  Through here newer higher powered camera than mine, we were now looking at a stationary craft that had a distinct circular outline that can't be seen with the naked eye.  It seemed to be a large craft with other lights moving either around it, and/ or to & from it.  Some lights seemed to disappear then reappear randomly.  The large distant craft had a steady blinking red light just like a passenger airliner except it was stationary in the sky.  We observed 3-4 solid white lights just behind. As she turned her smartphone into panoramic view & zoomed in even further we could now make out several other odd shaped lights moving in & out or circling the craft high in the sky.  There is no doubt in my mind after last night that this is highly sophisticated yet seemingly uncoordinated military exercises, or we are not alone.

I also ruled helicopters/other human craft out because of the uncanny movement I observed.  The craft seemed like they were interacting with one another, slowly advancing, and then moving back to their former location.I went and got my brother so that he could witness the crafts as well.  He is a very smart individual and even he did not have an explanation for what he saw.  I then spotted a third craft a little west and directly straight up in the sky.  I went outside to get a better look.  I looked directly up in the sky and the craft slowly positioned itself directly above me.  I stood in awe.

The other night, we smelled smoke and went outside to look around in doing so I looked up at the sky and noticed a strange twinkling what I thought was a star, suddenly above shot a white light across the night sky.  My husband ran to get our binoculars and night vision goggles.  We started looking and saw a few twinkling spots and through the binoculars there was blue, green, red, orange lights flashing on what I assumed was a alien craft.  This evening we went outside and saw the same twinkling lights and as I looked I counted 11 crafts some of which the colors flashing brightly without any binoculars.  With binoculars and night vision goggles we could see all the lights, our neighbors also stood outside with us looking at the many crafts scattered across the night skies.  These crafts are very high in the skies sitting still as can be and completely silent.  There were a few helicopters and airplanes what I could only guess to be investigating what we are witnessing take place.

What made it unusual is that the light suddenly appeared and it wandered slightly (was not in a fixed position in the sky).

1446,"Unusually low lights that broke up and flashed about 20 minutes in Sumner, WAMay 22, 2017  Yesterday was a beautiful warm day.  The sky was clear with patchy clouds here and there.  As it began getting dark, I was disappointed because as usual, the sky was overcast, and not many stars could be seen.Maybe around 11pm, I was outside having a smoke and looking up to the sky. Night before last, within about 10 minutes, I seen what I think were satellites.  Two separate tiny white lights, like specks, no flashing or any other colors just steady white light zoom across the sky.  Tonight, all of the sudden I see one solid white speck of light but it's much lower than the two that I seen the night before.  Travelling fast, steady white light. I grab the camera but my screen is broken so I can't see what I'm aiming at.  Pointed it in the direction of the light which I can see with my eyes but it's already a bit away from me.  I did manage to capture a few seconds of it on video but the quality is poor.I had some house chores to do and made a late dinner.  Remembered that I needed to send an email with photos attached so went upstairs to do so.  I'm borrowing a computer from a friend and not used to Windows 10 and had to figure out how to download the pics from my camera.  And I got sidetracked...Next thing I know, it's almost 4am!  I turn off the tv and look outside and quickly notice a super bright orange light in the flight path but it seems to be descending. It was very low, grabbed the camera and pointed in it's direction.  Then a bright white light comes from same direction and looks to be slowing down.  I took five separate videos because the lights were busy - doing something for probably 20  minutes.  Two of those videos did not come out. You can hear me on them but no video was recorded until the last few seconds of one. I was surprised and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.  All together, I think there was at least four lights - low, and they would break into different lights flashing - at one point, the first two lights were making a cross of red, yellow and blue flashing very quickly but that doesn't show on the video.  I'm a bit embarassed of the quality of my video - it's extremely poor - Canon Powershot, video taken outside my upstairs bedroom win! dow through the screen.  Diidn't have another angle accessible for viewing. Got just a bit nervous towards the end of videoing because a couple of the lights seemed to flash close.  Don't know how to describe but my friend and I have captured many videos in the past and sometime when capturing unusual lights - it might not be noticed by the person filming at the time, but upon reviewing, it will seem like the light(s) will suddenly come up on you quick.  Oh, and my cat kept getting in the way.  In one of the videos, there's a weird sound, otherwise, it was quiet outside. I'm estimating some people around the Sumner, Pacific, Edgewood areas HAD TO HAVE SEEN THESE.  I have no idea how low they were but from where I was watching, the lights were below.  I almost called the cops because I've heard of other people doing that  - to see if anyone else had called but it was after 4 am and didn't want to sound like a crack pot.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Sumner, WA",Occurred : 5/22/2017 04:10  (Entered as : 05222017 04:10),Posted: 6/2/2017,Reported: 5/22/2017 4:56:30 PM 16:56,Shape: Light

The window of view was very narrow, between Giant Rock and the smaller rock at the East side of it.  At that point, I didn't have a NVG on hand, the object was very large, visible to the naked eye.  A girl with NVG on hand handed it to me to confirm the object is a UFO as she was new to it and not sure how to use the NVG.  I took the NVG and focused it to a clear view as it was blurry at that point.  With NVG now, I observed the object for about 2min, flying West/Southwest towards and behind the Spy Mountain.  It had a Diamond shape around it with a round center and a much smaller round darker area! at the 1/3 point from the bottom. It had a very pale orange tint to it at this point.

I, Melinda Leslie, was leading my Sunday night, May 21st, Sky Watch with Night Vision Goggle Intensive out at Giant Rock on the 3rd night of viewing events for CITD.  Luckily one of my participants, Graham Slater, caught this and many of our other sightings (from all 3 nights no less), with his black and white night vision video camera.  His additional footage of some of the other incredible sightings will be posted at a future date once they are compiled.Here's a description of the jet chase sighting:  At just before 10:00 p.m. (did not note exact time) some of my participants and I saw a large amber colored light low to the horizon just behind Giant Rock from where my whole group of about 50 plus people were gathered and using 15 pair of night vision goggles.  A contigenecy of about 20 of us ran to get a better view of it.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a large orangish (amber) light, that quoting some of the 20 people; ""flew like a bumble bee.""  One guest, [name removed/CMS/jpg], came running with a pair of the goggles in hand and got a good look at it.  She said that through the goggles it looked like ""a large diamond shaped UFO.""  She drew a picture of it attached here.  This object then flew behind a small hill right behind the entire Sky Watch larger group.  As those of us who ran off walked back to join the others, 3 military jets flew over in the direction of the object now gone from sight behind the hill.  Some of us commented that ""if"" ""they"" were following it, meaning the jets, they were a few minutes too late.Just then, we heard the sound of a low flying jet from behind the hill, and suddenly clearing the top of the hill and right over our heads, came a very fast military jet chasing a faster large red glowing light.  The military jet had both red and white blinking strobe lights and glowing afterburners and was VERY loud as it flew directly above our heads.  The large red light had NO blinking lights and NO sound at all!  It became clear to all 50 plus witnesses, this was NO jet!!!  Those folks present who looked with the aid of the goggles said they were seeing either 2 lights, or one object with 2 light sources on it.  After extensive review of the footage, I am nearly certain it shows 2 UFOs (fast moving lights), flying in perfect locked tandem with one another.  It appears you can see stars between them in the background suggesting that these are 2 separate objects.As is usually the case, this footage while incredible, does not do the sighting justice.  The video is in black and white night vision, not full-color naked-eye vision, and does not have any sound, so you are unable to hear the palatable excitement of 50 plus witnesses screaming and cheering.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Landers (Yucca Valley), CA",Occurred : 5/21/2017 22:00  (Entered as : 05/21/17 22:00),Posted: 6/2/2017,Reported: 6/1/2017 5:38:43 PM 17:38,Shape: Diamond

1458,"Bright light chased by Military Jet at Giant Rock during Contact in the Desert 2017.While on a UFO night-watch at Giant Rock with participants attending the Contact in the Desert event, approximately 50 of us gathered to watch the sky and share at least 15 pairs of Generation 3 military goggles provided by the host of the event.At approximately 10pm, a few people noticed a bright red-orange point of light glowing constantly bright, not blinking and moving from one field of view to another in between the two giant rocks and hills.  I and approximately 10 others joined the observers to catch a quick glimpse before it left our field of view.At this time, for approximately 1-2 minutes, I observed this light through the goggles.  The first thing I did was adjust the depth of field in the goggles.  The goggles were in focus for high altitude focus, making the stars above look very clear.  To view this object up close, I had to lens all the way to the closest depth to see the object clearly.What I saw during the time the focus was clear was a diamond shape with sides very close to being equal all the way around.  I could see definition in the object enough to make out brighter areas in all four corners of the object and once more in the middle.  In the spaces in-between, it glowed with less intensity.  Once the object was out of view from being behind the rock, I immediately drew what I saw on paper and shared it with the event host.Approximately one minute after, in the same area we saw the diamond craft fly from left to right in our view, now I saw three aircrafts following the same route.  I am aware that military aircraft blink with multiple flashes in quick succession, whereas commercial and personal planes blink once.  This is how I came to my conclusion.Moments after we noticed the above mentioned aircrafts, a large bright light appearing red-orange emerged from over the hill we stood below.  The light zoomed quickly over our heads at the height of approximately 1000 ft.  I remember noticing that there was no sound coming from the light.A moment later, following the light, emerged a military jet craft making loud noise as it flew by us.  The jet seemed to be chasing the light.  The light flew straight towards the hills to our other side, and the jet chased it until they could not be seen with my physical sight.One of the group participants using his own goggle recorded from his device a video, with no sound, showing the event.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports about the same event.

1460,"i witnessed a rectangle, very bright LED type light looking S/W and est. the distance of 8 miles.  It was huge.  The lights shut off.  GONEI looked outside my bedroom window in the Arden-Arcade area of Sacramento County at 21:41, looking South West and observed a Red/Orange RECTANGLE, very, very bright LED type light or combination of many lights.I estimate the distance of six to eight miles away and the size of approximately 200 yards wide and 100 yards high.  It was huge!  It appeared to be about 1000 feet in elevation.  It hovered or floated around not moving too much, just up and down a little.  The lights went to bright blueish and shut off, then reappeared back into the bright Red, Orange light, very intense light projection.It drifted South across my sight, same distance and elevation, then shut off.  I videoed it with my tablet, but my tablet only recorded a bluish speck, but I was able to take a screenshot from the video at its most intelligible position.  I blew up the speck so you can almost make out the rectangle shape.  I could see it through my tablet as I was recording it and knew it wasn't recording the same brightness and color, but at least I was able to record its presence.This exact same event took place last year starting on May 13th, 2016, and continued most every night for a week and I also took phone video and pictures with my phone of that event(s).I will attempt to get a better video with my cellphone, although it is not a smart phone, it does record better than my tablet.  I used my tablet because it has way better screenshot and enhancement features.

1462,"Heard popping sound.. then looking up, saw glowing ball above cigar shaped object.On May 21, I [a State HVAC contractor] was visiting a friend who owns an International Security firm.  We were at his home, just outside Jonesborough Tenn., when sometime in the afternoon as we were chatting, there was a popping sound above us.  Looking up we saw a small white light.  I say 'we', but he saw it first.  It was so small, it took me a few seconds to locate it.It didn't appear to be moving, so I grabbed my small 10x25 binoculars and focused in on it.  There was a shiney ball-shaped object that seemed to pulsate light, and under the light was a cigar shaped object that was pointing down, approxamately 30^ angle to the left.  There would be a pulse of light and the CS object was then pointing 30^ to the right.  These pulses occured approx. 3 seconds apart, with the object moving from one angle to the other, with each pulse.The distance of the CS object from the glowing mass was about 1/4 the length of the CS object.  The CS object itself was about 4-5 times the length of the lights diameter.  Other than its rounded ends, the body shape was constant.. like a cigar.It was difficult to guage how high it was, and it didn't appear to be decending.  It moved slowly to the west, as if it were drifting.. always at the same hight.  The entire experiance lasted 5-10 minutes.After giving it thought, it could have been something that was dropped from a higher vessle and when reaching a certain altitude, metalic parashoots opened.. which would acount for the 'popping' sound.The shifting degree's of the cigar could have been a 'swinging' motion, IF it was hanging.  Sunlight bouncing off metalic shoots could give the appearance of pulsating, stabalizing rockets, even though I've never seen or heard of 'metallic' para-shoots.Whatever it was.. it was pretty cool to watch!

1466,"Saturday May 20th, 2017, 11:30 p.m.  Silver Lake Kansas.  New moon so no moon that night, perfectly clear and windless, about 55-60º with a little moisture in the air from rains earlier that morning and the days before.A triangular shaped object that was cut in half a gap about 1/8 the total width of the object;straight down the middle making it appear as 2 separate objects to form one.  It materialized as a dimly illuminated condensation cloud/fog that disappeared just as quick as it came.My girlfriend and I were stargazing in the backyard of her stepdads house in the country, about 6 miles northwest of Topeka.  The only visible light was from the windows of the house.  We both were staring directly over our heads as the object seemed to go thru the moist air at a unmeasurable velocity of speed.  It was traveling due west and appeared for 1-2 secs.  It was as if it were cloaked and the vapor it caused were the only means of visibility.The only reference to size is my index and thumb about a inch, inch and a half apart with my arm fully extended in front of my field of view looking straight in the sky. Which the only visible portion of the objects travel path being about directly above us to over a tree that stands maybe 25 ft high to the west of us on the south side of the fence which on the other side is hundreds of acres of farming fields.From 1st sight directly above us; to disapperance; it covered this vast part of sky above us almost to the horizon in a matter of seconds, 2 max.  We were sitting inside the fenced in backyard of chain about belly button high.  We sat in a backwards leaning lawn chair with my girlfriend sitting directly on my lap with the back of her head on my shoulder so we both had the same field of view.  We had a blanket 3ft behind us on a clothes line which we used as a block of the ambient light of the house windows.The light it illuminated was almost rainbow spectrum In There Was No Solid Color To Associate With It.  I saw it flash above which is what drew my eyes, it being dark out i thought maybe my eyes were tricking me, so I asked my girlfriend if she ""just saw that,"" and at the same time as if she was gonna say the samething and finished by answering the question, she said she wasn’t going to say anything cause she thought her eyes were messing with her also, and ""umm...yeah i ((word deleted)) saw that!""  Even if we had the equipment to record the sky that night we would’ve needed about 6 cameras in night vision coving as much of the sky as possible and it would have been a one in a million chance of actually capturing it.I've been interested in RESEARCHING the unknown as pertains to ufo and ebe’s, to secret dark government/military space programs.  With all the channels I subscribe to and talk shows I listen to it was just a matter of time before my girlfriend would become interested in the subject herself but it was not until a few days ago that the 1st ufo sighting I’ve experienced and hers as well which brought all the things she hears me listening to and watching become something brought to fruition, a experience, something that was just a subject until we had a 1st hand witnessing  of something almost indescribable due to it or anything similar in nature have never been reported by anyone worldwide (to our knowledge) which created way more questions than the simple satisfaction of just observing an anomaly.That experience has turned my ole lady who is a former collegiate gymnast that gives private lessons to people who would let something like this make them think I'm ""one of them people"" and id have no clients for income.  From that standpoint  To now another believer via 1st hand experience.  In the years of interest in the subject and years of listening to coast to coast I have never heard anything close to describing the sighting that we had.  With the Uniqueness of the appearance of the object materializing/causing a disturbance in the air which gave shape, speed and size. Im a graphic artist and am currently opening my own costom silk screen printing  and tattoo shop.  I've been in the tshirt business for about 2 1/2 years running a store in downtown topeka. sometimes solo and still pushing out 300 shirts worth of orders.  On breaks id watch videos and as a graphic artist was highly disappointed in all the cgi and disinformation  out there that i didnt know what to/not to look for. Hence this being my 1st in 35 years of life.The reason I'm reporting this is due to its unique nature and the curiosity it spewed out of me. Wondering if anyone anywhere at anytime has experienced anything similar at all.That night we also observed a few other unexplainable events that we have never experienced. One being a unknown light due south of us close to the kansas river, about 1-2 miles away and what appeared 200-300ft above the ground, as we were looking upward, in the lower peripheral of our vision the light just appeared out of nowhere ad grew in intensity to the point of illuminating part o the sky, as the flash happened we looked for the light which had vanished as quickly as it appeared. Another light like that also appeared on the western horizon about a hour after the river one.We also witnessed what appeared as “stars” moving a high rate of speed. 2 of them going directly north to a south southwest direction. The third one seemed to come from the southwest and curved back towards the north west with another light directly behind it about 10-15 seconds. All of these id probably hafta say were satellites in orbit and maybe the iss.We witnessed what seemed to be a couple military aircraft that were flying directly across from each other maybe 10miles wing tip to wing tip at the same altitude and velocity with nothing but a red light to identify both of them as they came out of the western horizon and disappearing into the eastern horizon.Around 12:15 we witnessed a “aircraft” with A Single Bright Yellowish Light That Didn’t Flash, traveled north to south but the thing that caught our attention was the erratic movements. It seemed to glitch, the best ways to describe it. It’d seem to stand still for a couple seconds then dash forward, move left and right in very jerky, not smooth at all movement.  The best I can describe it is visual glitching causing it to skip fwd in space to make up for the time that it was in a static position.  Only explanation I have for that one is maybe the air temps and atmospheric variables that makes stars twinkle and seem to oscillate light intensities.",Duration:2 seconds,"Location: Silver Lake, KS",Occurred : 5/20/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 05/20/17 22:30),Posted: 6/2/2017,Reported: 5/23/2017 12:45:01 AM 00:45,Shape: Triangle

It was an overcast/wet night and bright blue circle moved east to west through the clouds.  There was no lightning etc.   I do not believe it to be a satellite or plane (only small, light planes fly in this area).This occurred approximately 20km North of Bunbury, Western Australia, whilst driving South towards Bunbury.

Cloud was a straight, narrow vertical line that looked very unusual and stuck out compared to the rest of the sky.  The only reason I really noticed this was because of the strange events on Saturday night.  I checked flight radar etc. and there were no planes in the area or nearby.

A moment later I looked up again to the east and saw what at first thought seemed like four helium balloons ascending separately a few hundred feet apart at an estimated 500 feet elevation.three appeared white and one had a dark metallic color.  Their trajectories at first were consistent with helium party balloons.  After three or four minutes watching the objects had receded from orb shape to point light sources and three of the four collard a convergent path while the fourth remained at a distance.  It was at this point that I expected the objects to appear as black dots and plane out with the upper level! winds if they were balloons.

I saw a large plane, like a 747, with what looked like a triangle flying next to it.I was looking to the north.  The plane was flying east, at fairly high altitude.  There was silver or white triangle flying on the right side of the plane just back from the nose of the plane.  The triangle was shaped like a very narrow paper airplane.  It was traveling at the same speed as the plane and was about half as long as the plane.I watched the two fly above a cloud and then come out the other side.

It was in the middle of the afternoon on a sunny day with a few clouds.  The plane could not have taken off at our local airport because of its high altitude.  Had it taken off at GEG, it would have been much lower.  However, Fairchild AF base is very near the airport.  I guess maybe it could have been one of their planes.

My senses are always on high at night since I have a bit of a phobia of the dark, but when I glanced out my bedroom window a saw a strange light in the distance; hovering over the large field thats across from my house.

The object seemed to be glowing red (sometimes I thought I saw orange).  The size kept changing..it seemed to shrink a bit. At one point the red light moved, slightly in a triangle shape. The red light was too far into the sky to be a drone.  I did not notice any other lights in the sky, but for stars.  It was making me crazy that I had no one to witness this, and my cell phone was dead.  I suddenly saw 2 teenage girls in the field to my left.  I shouted down to them and asked if they too could see the light from where they stood (I was up higher on the street, and the field was below me).  At 1st they could not see it because they were looking in the wrong direction.  Once they spotted it, they both yelled...what is that.  All the sudden it began to shrink in size until it was gone..about 3 seconds.  They both started shouting what was that..thanked me for showing to them..and I drove off.  The light was too far away to be a drone and way too far in the sky.  Too see my vantage point, you can google Key Stone Oaks High School,  My Lebanon, PA.  I was parked on Delwood Ave. in Dormont, PA.  I'd say I was looking toward the Southern Sky when I saw it.  This is driving me crazy!!

1520,"Solid orange linear balls of light over the ocean Garden City, SCWe were on an Ocean Front balcony when the first lights appeared.  They were two shapes on the first sighting a set of four linear round orange balls and four to five orange sphere shaped of a slightly larger size.  The lights were all on and then one by one went off.  They were not flashing, they were solid in color.  We were stunned.  We waited and about 10 minutes later they appeared  a little farther south over the ocean.  This time they were two separate sets of round orange lights (no sphere shaped) that were perfectly linear, a dark space of the sky separating the two, which made it difficult to tell if two objects or one large.  Each linear set was made up of 4 solid huge orange balls or orbs (we think, it's kind of fading in our mind, weird)  They once again went black one by one and we never saw them again.

I looked at my phone which had a full battery just 5 minutes earlier, and the battery went from a full charge down to no charge. I thought how strange.  I plugged it in and then heard a sound like a loud roar of thunder.  As I looked out the window I could see something in the distance emerging from the storm which was more of a light show from all of the lightening.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then soon realized this was no plane.  It was much too large and It was glowing red and looked like it had a very bright white light that came around, but from the inside as it circled around whatever this was.  As I watched it fly to the west towards the Mountains the loud roar seemed! to just stop, but the object kept moving. just seconds after it was out of sight the lightening and wind calmed down.

The first one was farther away to take a photo of.  The first was super high in the sky prepared to the second one was lower.  They both were moving slow at around the same speed.  The second was super close and going over a house past a plane that must of took off from midway airport.  I couldn't take a video of it because I was on the phone with an old friend.

I have Sony a350 DSLR, 1/2000, iso 400, f8 shooting specs.  I was shooting the Nellis AFB airplanes coming in for a landing.  I was looking North as some airplanes come straight down the Vegas Blvd to do 2 180 degree turns  and land at Nellis, there was about 22 planes in this group.  At about plane 18, I kept looking North down the Blvd and spotted a light coming behind and out of the clouds.  There were a few cloud banks in the area and I began to shoot, even if I couldn't see it, I still kept shooting, I managed to get 10 shots off in 10 or 15 seconds.  I recorded a image on 9 out 10.

I blew it up to about 200 percent and it looked like a cloud of circular smoke. I probably don't have the best equipment to say what it was.  And with! so few pixels, well we don't have enough solid evidence other than it descending path, which can be calculated by time to say, yes this was a UFO.  But the object started up at 1000 ft and pulled a 45 degree descent.  And then just and disappeared.  As the last frame shows it covered some distance really quickly that's why I was determined to just shoot blindly.

1549,"I was driving south 275 at 75 mph and saw an airplane and remember thinking it was strange how low it was flying.  I continued driving and soon caught up to the craft amazed how quick I caught up an airplane.  As I pasted it, I immediately could tell it was not a commercial airplane.  It was dark and more of a triangular shape with, I believe, five lights underneath.  The nose of the craft was facing south and it was just hovering over the trees off the right of the interstate near a neighborhood.  I could not tell if it made any noise due to my radio. I was left feeling shocked.  I thought maybe it could have been a military plane since I was about 50 minutes away from MacDill AFB.  But what raised questions is 1) being so close to the craft, why could not hear it over the radio, 2) what would the air force be doing flying so low through a residential area?

I was using the binoculars to watch a family of falcons near the woodline to the south of where I was sitting.  It was a hot, clear day.  Not a cloud in the sky, visibility was for miles from the sky, I'm sure. There were also high flying aircraft in the sky that day, and from time to time I was pointing the binoculars to get a look at the aircraft and their contrails.  I've been an aviation enthusiast for my entire life and have attended countless airshows featuring both military and civilian aircraft.  There was an aircraft flying at high altitude, leaving a contrail.  I followed it with the binoculars as it traveled from south to the north.  After following it for approximately 10 seconds or so, I noticed a strange metallic glint just to what would have been the aircraft's 8 o'clock.  I remember thinking, ""wow.. that plane is close to the other one.."" but then realized that this object wasn't moving, and wasn't leaving contrails like all the other aircraft at that altitude were.  I pulled the binoculars away to see if I could see the object without the aid of the optics, but I couldn't - so I looked through them again, found the object again.  It was completely stationary.  Definitely metallic.  I remember seeing the sun glimmering off the surface.  It was far away, and I was using 7x50 power binoculars..  I could tell it was egg shaped with what appeared to be.. spikes jutting from the craft.  I looked away from the binoculars again to try again with my naked eye, but couldn't see it.  I went back to the binoculars and was unable to find it again.  I'm under the assumption that it must've left the area, as I was unable to find it again.

There were four orbs first 3 green, one was blue and the other red flying with a movement that did not resemble a shooting star, jet, airplane or satellite in a square like formation.  They created a diamond shape formation as pictured below with the two of the greens being capture in the photo and the blue directly in the middle of the two simultaneously flashing.

They were in the southeastern sky (approximately 150 degrees on the compass).  The right and left lights were only very slightly one above the other with the left one being a tad higher.  The left light would wobble back and forth and up and down but the right light was as steady as a rock.  It seemed to be getting closer as we headed inside after watching them for a good ten minutes.  We did not hear any planes passing with in hearing distance.  When we returned outside 30 minutes later we could no longer see the lights.  The right hand light was fairly steady, the left hand light seemed to get a tad brighter and then darker.  I look at stars fairly frequently.  I checked my astrolabe app to ensure the lights weren't stars or planets.  I'm skeptical of it being a ufo, but I couldn't really come up with a good explanation for it.

1610,"Bright stationary disc of light in pre-dawnI get up early for work, and it is not unusual to take the dog out before daybreak.  On May 10, I was outside with the dog at 5:15 am, waiting for her to finish up so I could get ready for work.  I was looking at the sky to see what stars I could identify, but there were scattered clouds so I didn’t see many.  I realized there was a very bright light behind one group of clouds and thought to myself that the moon was extremely bright.  The clouds were low and as they moved past the bright light, what I originally thought was the glow of the moon was not the moon after all.I didn’t see any definitive shape, just a very bright light, like a spotlight, and I thought it must be a helicopter.  It definitely wasn’t an airplane--it didn’t move.  Then I realized for a spotlight to be that bright and that large, I should hear some sort of sound.While we do live a couple of miles from a freeway, at that hour of the morning, there is very little noise in the neighborhood.

1638,"EMERALD GREEN ORB PUTS ON LIGHT SHOW IN MARIETTA GA.The wife and I were sitting on our deck, looking at the stars and the waxing moon.  It was around 9:00 P.M. on a cool Spring Sunday night.  The sky was clear and cloud free. The moon was @ 95% full.  I was looking over the roof line of my house towards the south and east.  My wife was looking south and west.  Suddenly there was a flash of light over the roof line in my sight of vision.  It was an intense, luminous emerald green color.  It looked like electrical sparks with arcing shards of current.  It appeared to be 3 or 4 times larger than the moon.  From the center of this matrix emerged what appeared to be a round or slightly oval orb with what looked like a lightning bolt trailing it.  The short trajectory of the object curved @ 180 degrees (like the letter C) and it stopped at that point.  The trailing energy field that followed the orb was visually sizzling (no sound) like the fuse of a firecracker and eventually subsided.  The orb was standing completely motionless at that point. If the moon was a basketball this orb would have been a softball.  I yelled at my wife to look at the object and she stood up in time to see it begin to pulse and speed away.  It shot into the tree line and disappeared.  I have never seen anything move so fast from a dead stop.  It seemed to me the pulsing of the object correlated with it's rate of acceleration,.as if the pulsing was a proponent of it's propulsion.  The angle of the sighting was at a 45/50 degree angle.  It appeared to be moving laterally due south.  My personal opinion is that the object made a dimensional shift, like a car running off the road.  The initial light show appeared to be a force field that had been breached.

Its wingspan fully covered the two-car driveway I was walking on, and then some.  I was walking directly north towards my house after checking on my kids who were attending a birthday party at another home in my complex.I noticed something just above my line of vision.  At first I thought it was a cloud forming, as it had the consistency of a fine, mist type cloud.  As it continued to move forward, I realized that the object had a solid outline with a consistent shape.  At that point, I thought perhaps it was a hang glider, but considering that this was in Texas, where there are no large hills, that made no sense at all.  Then, I thought it might have been a flock of birds, but the object had a solid form and a consistency of shape as it flew by.  It continued to fly or glide at a consistent rate and a direct line path, until I could no longer see it.The object was completely silent.  There were no lights.  The object almost blended into the starry background of the sky.  It had a somewhat mottled color of white and possibly dark, navy blue, grey or black.  The event lasted approximately 30 seconds before the image either evaporated, disappeared, or merely faded into the skyline, where the lights of the city were glowing over the homes across the street.  It was a beautiful clear night with no clouds.  I was taking photographs of the moon earlier in the evening.The object was flying very low and appeared to be only about 30 feet above the roof line of the homes it was flying over.  The object was not moving very fast.  If I had started running very quickly I might have been able to keep up with it.

I was in shock and awe.  By the time my brain registered that this was possibly an UFO I had a split-second thought to grab my cell phone and record it, but by then it was gone.

During the ascent of this light or craft, a regular jet with blinking lights was crossing over the mountain range during this time, but considerably lower, as I believe the jet was landing either at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, or headed to Burbank (Bob Hope Airport).

For a minute I thought it was just another planet. Then thoughts crossed my mind if it was a man made satellite. It couldn’t have been however. It was moving different directions. First traveling towards the South sky. Then it began crossing in a back and forth motion. It would occasionally stop for a minute or two. Then it would go back up and move in this back and forth motion.At this point I stood up knowing it was not man made, as my friend tracked it, I ran quickly grabbed my high powered laser pointer (10 Mile radius Class 4 green colored) my friend pointed it out and we shone it to see if there would be reaction from it. It did seem to react which was very interesting meaning it must have spotted this light, at least a very low power of it. As soon as i shone at this light, it stopped and stood still. It didn't move for at least 5 minutes. It moved again and I shone at it again. The craft stopped again. By this point my friend and I ran inside and changed and began looking up who records these sightings.11:48 p.m CST.  (The call in)  After seeing this I began looking for somebody who would take in this sighting.  I googled exactly where to report and immediately called the hotline.11:50 p.m CST.I told the man at first how i swear it was not a prank call.  I forgot his name (I asked at the end and completely forgot) I explained it as “A fireball"" looking thing that switched directions in the sky”  It was in more words but if I were not so panicky of giving a 15 second detail it would've sounded better.  He told me to make a report on what me and my friend saw and in a way he could describe it.  Therefore, I made this report in order to show that a sighting is just a matter of paying attention.12:09 a.m CST.I began writing the report and finally finished at 12:30 a.m .

1667,"helicopter chasing orange light at low altitudeI was in my room in my apartment watching Dave Chappelle on Netflix, when I heard a helicopter overhead.  It sounded very low and powerful, so I figured it had to be military, and I-being a total nerd-had to run out to the parking lot to get a look.By the time I was out my door and in the parking lot, I had just enough time to watch a small orange ball of light being chased by what I assume to be a Blackhawk helicopter (because of size and sound) disappear behind the rooftops of the buildings east of me.    This struck me as bizarre because I saw something similar some months ago in the same general area (skies south of Lawrence, I live on the south side of town, not far from Baker Wetlands).  The light was small and orange in color and was about 50-100 yards ahead of the helicopter.  It made no erratic movements but was travelling at a fair clip as the helicopter was tracking it at almost the exact speed and it was moving pretty quickly.  As such, I have my doubts that this could've been a paper lantern (though the color and intensity of the light were similar to one) and the distance ahead of the helicopter rules out a refueling boom.  I'd give the altitude of the two objects to be between 500-1000 ft agl and the speed! of both to be about 100 kts at the time I saw them.Also of note, I saw another object in the sky in the general area at the same time, though it may not have been connected.  This object seemed to be an aircraft judging by the red and white lights it had on it, but it hovered in place for a moment until the lights slowly faded out with no apparent change in location.  The direction I was looking toward would be about a straight line to KCI, so I wasn't immediately suspicious, but--having seen plenty of air traffic heading to and from KCI on that flight path--this didn't look like anything I'd seen before (no landing lights).  I mention this because it was odd and because the previous sighting of a few months earlier of the same kind of event had 2 helicopters chasing the light instead of just one.  Maybe this was the second.",Duration:~1 minute,"Location: Lawrence, KS",Occurred : 5/4/2017 23:00  (Entered as : 05/04/17 23:00),Posted: 5/6/2017,Reported: 5/5/2017 11:42:29 AM 11:42,Shape: Light

I thought it was a commercial plan but then it moved fast and then just stopped in the sky.  I saw the other end of it and it was fire orange like some type of vent.  It at times moved in the direction the vent was pointing.  Oposite of what normal craft do.  This object moved so smoothly across the sky at fast speeds, slowing down, stopping, changing direction and angle effortlessly.  It was taller from top to bottom than it was wide, no wings.  The best was to describe is it was like a fly just smoothly making all the changes in flight pattern.  I saw a commercial air craft in between me and it and could judge distances from sizes of plane and it.  Hair stood up on my neck and I was very scared for the first min when I realized this is not normal and nothing I have ever seen before.

1693,"Orange steady lightThis description was given to me by someone I know. They have a video.Standing facing south in front of their home, approximately 200 ft from highway at 12:13--shortly after midnight, a strange steady orange light was observed south south west approximately a mile from home.  It was a clear night, no clouds were observed and very quiet.  No traffic passing on road and no wildlife sound.  The witness observed the light for about 5 minutes.  The light appeared to hover over buildings located in that area.  It appeared to be un-moving.  In the video, the light appeared to be a large object.  How large was difficult to ascertain.  The light can be seen above the tree line and was a steady non-blinking light.  At one point, the witness pointed a high powered blinking flashlight in the direction of the object due being unsure what the light was.  The witness was able to see some reflection of a dark shape around the light.  Right after shining the flashlight at the object, all electricity went out in the neighborhood.  This scared the witness who ran inside the home to check on the people inside.  All were ok.  The electricity came back on, so the witness went back outside and noted that the strange light was gone and an alarm was sounding from the building the light had been hovering over.  At this point, the sounds of wildlife returned...frogs, circadas, and coyotes.  Approximately an hour later, the witness noted the same orange light North of him and much further away.  The light appeared to be moving slowly away from the witness's location and then disappeared.  The witness spoke to the people who worked in the building the next morning to see if maybe there was a break-in the night before.  They agreed that the alarm had gone off, but there was no sign of a break-in.  Also spoke to a neighbor who also noted the electricity had gone off for a few seconds the night before.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Houma, LA",Occurred : 5/2/2017 00:13  (Entered as : 05/02/2017 0:13),Posted: 5/6/2017,Reported: 5/6/2017 3:44:37 AM 03:44,Shape: Disk

It came on again within 2 seconds.  I didn't think much of it since it was in a high flight path for airlines.  In between the light flashes, the object didn't move much more the a passenger plane would have moved, it flashed one more time and I never saw any lights again, it just disappeared.  I noticed there were no other navigation lights.  No red or green nor a flashing white. this flight path was west to east and would have to be 10 to 30 thousand feet.  No contrail was observed.  No sound heard.I would describe the light as very bright like a helicopter landing light.  The light was to my south and between 75 to 80 degrees, almost overhead.Within about 1 minute there was a plane making an east to west pass almost on a reciprocal course and altitude, all lights were visible, you could hear it, there was no comparison between the two.I spent 2 years active duty in the navy.

1697,"A few months ago, I was hiking in May sometime, around 8:30 pm, or so (whenever the sun began to set?).  I was located down by the big Darby Creek at the main park area (volley ball court, ranger station is located -- between Alkire and st. rt. 70).  While I was enjoying my hike down along the creek, I also just happened to look up in the sky and saw a slow approaching ""orange"" craft of sorts.  It approached from the southwest and directionally moving West toward the Dayton area (my own conclusion).  Naturally, I was trying to listen to it since it was a low flying, blurry-orange, circular craft of sorts,  The craft was approximately 200-feet above the tree tops.  Conversely, however, there was NO SOUND.  Speed was that of a commercial jet aircraft descending slowly in altitude just before a landing.  However, this craft just stayed at an even altitude just above the trees.  Just as it passed above me it kept flying straight, and then all of a sudden, it decided to ascend rapidly and silently at approximately a 65-degree angle.  The notable part was that it reached peak altitude (that of a typical jet) of approximately 37,000 to 40,000 feet within only a 5-second time frame -- YES, SILENTLY AND VERY VERY FAST!  This is the first time I've ever seen a craft like this.  As it ascended it also had a mysterious after glow in front of it, and directly behind it, hence the glowing effect with orange color.  Yes, it more or less freaked me out, but then again I still believe it to be terrestrial in nature (of the earth), and perhaps one of those little-hidden high-tech crafts ingeniously created out of some alien-type technology (area 51 stuff).  I have heard that Dayton's Write-Patterson air force base (about 50 miles away from Darby?) has some underground secrets, maybe that craft was one of them.  Yep, this sounds like just another nut-job trying to stir the mystical UFO pot, but I saw what I saw.I had a friend tell me that it was some small space debris burning up in our atmosphere, but I have to say this was not that.  It flew slowly, it had a purpose, and it flew exact and silent.  So I looked it up on youtube and low and behold I saw a craft(s) similar to what I saw -- wow.  Has anyone else on here ever seen such a craft?  I bet someone has.  Even if it's a clear night out (which it was when I saw it) it will still appear as though it's in a foggy cloud, hence, you cannot see any specific details other than a round orange shape, no sound, and definitely a flying craft.Take care.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1698,"Brilliant Blue Beam of light shot into kitchen from window, the flash stretched about ten feet and disappeared in secondsAround 9 PM, I was cooking dinner on the stove with my friend.  To the left of me was the fridge, and to the right of me is a window on the adjacent wall above the sink.  My friend was in front of the stove, I was about three feet behind him.  He was turned slightly toward me, when this occurred, but he is colorblind, so he saw the brightness of the flash but not the brilliance.  It was as if a straight beam of brilliant blue light flashed in from the window in a horizontal line in front of him, 2 feet above the counter, from the window towards the fridge.  It was so bright, I was unable to regain vision for a second after it happened.  I could swear that I heard a grinding noise in my ears when it flashed, but that may have been from shock.  It was not one consistent color blue, there were shades in it, and it had some orange tinges at parts.  It was the most beautiful light i have ever seen but if i didn't know any better, I would swear that for that few seconds, a seam in the universe ripped. I have had two other sightings earlier this year that were the same, but different from this one.  I am at work, but will try to report them later.  I do not know if what I saw was UFO related.

I got off the highway at the Peter’s Creek Exit (east side of highway closest to the mountains).  There is a parking lot with a large rock painted to look like a lady bug.  I saw what looked like a low flying plane, with a flight path headed west over the parking lot from the mountains. I pulled into the parking lot to look up and get a closer look of this “plane”. As I pulled to a stop, the object slowed to a stop in front of me and vertically descended to about 100 ft. Its shape was rectangular with four red blinking lights at the corners of its shape.  I remember saying out loud, “Oh my God, this isn’t a plane!”  After that, a white light in the middle of the object started to light up, and I started to get freaked out. I put my transmission into gear and spun around and left the parking lot quickly. It changed direction and starting following me north.  I started screaming because I was scared.  Whatever it was, was going to try and take me.  It was keeping pace with me and flying directly above me so I increased my speed.  It followed me from the parking lot by the highway exit to my street which is about almost one mile to my street.  I turned north from the side road from the parking lot to head towards my street and it was still following me.  I turned east down another street and then north again to head down my street.

1726,"2 larger than planet size bell/saucer shapes with bright amber/white light emitting from each hovered briefly then vanished.My wife and i were travelling east on Route 30 east of Chambersburg, PA, on Saturday 4/29/2017.  My wife suddenly told me to pull over on the road because there were two objects in the sky in the proximity of a waxing crescent moon phase.  I have seen UFO objects twice in my lifetime before this at least 40 plus years ago.  We both looked at the objects while we were facing the west.  The two objects appeared to be larger than a planet, saucer/bell shapes in the sky, both were bright with an amber to white hue cast sort of pulsing as they stood at rest in the sky.  I had hoped that they would continue to get closer coming eastward to get a better look at them, but after about a minute, the one on the right began to slowly vanish followed by the one on the left then slowly vanishing.  There was a slight overcast with very high altitude cloud cover with some clearing.  When the objects vanished out of sight, it appeared as though they exited our atmosphere very quickly ! almost straight up and out.  Back in the early 1970's when i saw my first UFO, it occured in broad daylight, and actually had time to get my telescope out (50X) and sight in on it, before it quickly raced across the sky many times the speed of a modern military jet aircraft, and vanished as well.  I understand from my reading that the USA government does in fact have secret propulsion technology at Area #51 and has had it for years, continuing to unveil this high technology into military uses today.  I would not be surprised that the two UFO's we sighted on 4/29/2017 were engineered by our own government.  It is very exciting to see these objects, because it doesn't happen but once or so in a lifetime.  This is my third sighting in 43 years.  Now i must look at the skies every night.  My cell phone camera is too cheap, it would not have showed up well, but to be honest i just wanted to see these UFO's with my eyes.  My wife was a witness to this sighting as well, but she really did not want to take the time to write her own version of the sighting.  It was quick,,,about a minute.

The formation of lights, no more than 200ft off the ground, silently passed overhead moving Northeast. Importantly, the lights seemed to deliberately dip and bob without breaking formation, suggesting they are indeed units comprising a larger array.The formation moved over Water St until it was visible over the Rowe Laboratory.  Interestingly, while moving, the lights adjacent to the trailing terminal lights on either end of the “V” gracefully switched positions.  The formation stopped after this and faded out of sight.

1736,"Bright flashing light moving great distance in under a second in south NJ.I was at a friend's house sitting on his front porch busy street busy area.  Talking about random stuff video games, etc..  He was like hey look at that, I'm like what ... look right there he pointed out a weird flashing object kind of strobish and similar to a plane flash but much brighter.  I said that's a plane he said no look how it's moving.  From where we were sitting he had a telephone pole to our right on an angle so we eyed it up with the pole to see which way it's moving if it even is moving and sure enough a couple of seconds after we did that it started moving.In between the bright flashes, within a mili second of each one, we saw it in one spot then wam it was at least 1,000 yards (from our eyes, could be miles in the sky) but away from its original position.  We had a hard time keeping up with it in between flashes and moving irradic from left to right up And down.  Nothing that a plane helicopter or drone in today's world that's known to the public can move with such speed and agility.  Literally between its flashes, which was absolutely in under a second, it was in a totally different spot far away from the last position.  We watched do this for at least 15-20 minutes moving around.  Then it started moving a little farther away from us south east direction but still very visible with the flashes so bright.  But now it would flash then go dark completely no lights and show up in a totally different spot then it was like before.  We knew by then it wasn't a normal  plane especially because there are a bunch of planes flying in the sky and you see their regular flashes .So we were asking ourselves how do these planes not see see this and move out the way or change course, but the way this thing was moving, it couldn't be near them at the speed in which it moved.  Then, after a minute or so of it going dark, a flashing, then dark again, moving to different spots.  It started flashing and rising up and just hovered while flashing.  Then lit up solid blue or white kind of like a floodlight, but nothing projecting down like you see with other common flood lights or search lights on commercial equipment, it just lit up whatever this thing was.  And for the way it reflected off the object it had to be a light colored object (white light with grey object projects a blueish color).It was fully lit up for about a good 25 seconds went completely dark again then within a mili second we saw the flash of it farther away from where it was lit up which is farther away from where we were.  So more south central south east .  The only thing out that way that it could be as high as it was a project that bright of a light is fort dix combined base  no other airports or private places for such a thing in that direction then fort dix joint base. And in that direction depending on which part of the base is a given 30 to 80 miles away from us.  So that thing was bright .After it headed farther away and disappeared me and my friend went to go get food took about 10 minutes or a little over got back to his house sat on the porch ate an we were still talking about it we never seen anything like it definitely unexplainable when all of sudden we saw it again back in the same area where it was before moving all over and flashing but did not light up solid or hover.  Just kept flashing then went dark and it was gone.  We sat outside for another 20 minutes looking at the sky, never saw it again or anything like it, just saw your normal plane passing by .It was truly amazing how it moved liked that in a blink of an eye.  A night to remember never saw anything like this here before hopefully someone else saw this too and didn't blow it off as a plane it was anything, but I know the area very well and seen everything from regular helicopters to police helis, blackhawks  An your military crafts fly by all the time with lights on and off day and night  just as common as your regular plane and you can hear these far away aswell as a very lit up landscape from homes ect so to be that bright to outshine everything else wow .  .

1747,"several glowing orbs &quot;dancing&quot; in the skyOn Thursday April 27, 2017, at approximately 7:30 pm, in West Kelowna, British Columbia, I was travelling home with my 3 daughters.  My 6 year old daughter said, “Daddy, what are those flashing lights in the sky?”  I was travelling in the southwest direction and I looked up to my left and I noticed several (approximatley 6) flashing lights up in the sky that appeared to flashing and what I would describe as dancing in the sky.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of them.  I thought they were some sort of flares or even military aircraft doing some sort of exercise.  But since I live in the Okanagan valley and there is no Air Force bases in the area, I knew they were not any of conventional military aircraft.  The objects that I was observing were absolutely silent.  Given the way these object were moving in the sky, I then realized that what I was witnessing was not a normal or easily explainable occurrence and was most likely Extra-terrestrial in nature.I quickly pulled off to the side of the road and grabbed my phoned\, got out of my vehicle to start video recording the lights.  That's when I noticed a second group of (approximatley 4 or 5) that suddenly appeared below the first group.  They looked like they were flying closer to Okanogan Lake, before the flew upward to join the first group.  The two groups formed two separate formations and proceeded to fly eastward towards Kelowna.  I had my camera zoomed in and locked on both groups and continued to record them as they were flying away.  Or so I thought.  After approximately 20-30 seconds of “recording”, I realized that I didn’t actually hit the record button on my phone.  I quickly hit the record button and was able to zoom in on the luminous objects as they were flying away.  I was able to record the lights, (which were flying in two groups, one approximately 6, the other approximately 4) for about 30 seconds until they essentially were out of sight.Important points:  although it was early evening and the sun was starting to set, there was still plenty of daylight outside.  These objects were extremely bright in sky the objects appeared to be well below the clouds when I first noticed them as well as below the tops of the mountains.  The second group of lights appeared to be flying lower in the valley near the lake although it did not occur to me at first but what I witnessed I would describe as orange glowing orbs, since I did not observe any sort of metallic craft with any visible lines.

We saw a low hovering (what we assumed was a plane at first) aircraft in the sky in front of us/in the direction we were heading but to the right (South of us).  It did not seem to be moving at first.  It had three lights on the underneath: two were a greenish tint and one was more of a regular white/yellow color turning on and off at random times slowly.  The one turning on and off seemed to move around like it was on a rotator.  All of the sudden, after we both acknowledged we saw it and started questioning what it was, it started to move East over the road very very slowly.  I had my window down and it made only a quiet sound. Then, on the tip of the 'wings' two more lights lit up (two on each end).  They were brighter than the three lights in the underneath middle of the craft.  We thought it was a very large drone after trying to rationalize.  It was a long skinny rectangle shape, but I saw no blades or anything.  If it was, it was a drone that was 15-20 feet or more. It was terrifying and my fiancé and I are very logical.  We asked the Indian man who picked us up in a golf cart to take us from the parking lot to the front if he knew of any drones the Indians had, and he acted concerned and said he did not.  He said the head Indians may have something like that for protection, but I honestly thought it had to be military.  Honestly, it looked like a multimillion dollar military aircraft with incredible mind blowing technology.  I was stunned and can not stop thinking about it!

1806,"Large reddish orange light that dropped many more lights out of it, and some smaller same colored lights shot out the top.I do star parties for hire with a large telescope I designed and built.  At 12:50 a.m., I was going east on Trancas Street in Napa, CA, heading home from a star party.  I observed a large orange/red circular light over about the area of the Queen of the Valley Hospital, about a quarter mile away from my position, moving slowly north to south, maybe 500-750 feet high (it looked lower than an airplane at pattern altitude).  The diameter of the circular light I observed I'd say was on the order of about the diameter of the length of a small airplane viewed at that distance, perhaps a bit smaller, so while very subjective, perhaps in the range of 20' diameter.As I watched it slowly moving, it dropped a large light out of it!  It fell straight down!  And then it dropped another and another and then a whole string of maybe 6 or more!  And more smaller lights shot out the top of the thing going up!  I did get some pictures but of course they're not great.

1810,"2 People witnessed 2 identical glowing objects in the sky over Irmo/Columbia, South Carolina, at approx 9:30pm, 4/22/17.My husband and I went out to our back deck at approx 9:30pm (21:30) on April 22, 2017, to sit for a few moments.  Upon exiting the east door to the deck we noticed the stars and Jupiter were quite bright and the moon was absent.  We shut off our deck lights so we could observe the sky since we know there was a meteor shower last night but we're not fortunate enough to see any.I thought perhaps we would see some left-over meteors tonight, so we stood facing east on the back/side deck area with the porch lights out.  To the south/south east is the city and it is brighter in that direction, there was also slight mist/clouds in that direction only (at that time).So, we both stood for a few minutes, and we both happened to be looking at the same thing, (which we did.  It realize until we were shocked at what we saw) two identical stars of exact same brightness, from our distance they appeared very small and high up, white in color, and approx 2-3 inches apart (of course we were on the deck looking at the sky), seems like normal stars, I thought the clouds were moving in fast but as it was it was NOT the clouds moving it was the ""stars.""  These objects moved exactly the same speed, were exactly the same size, exactly the same brightness, color exactly the same white, they appeared to never move erratically, they stayed exactly the same distance apart while moving, they both moved in the line of 2 at the same speed across the sky in an east/south east direction.  When they were directly in front of us in the sky, over our east neighbors rooftop, looking east, they grew VERY BRIGHT, the light was not quite white at this point it was more pale yellow, they both brightened at the exact same speed, the exact same time, the exact same size, they glowed for approx 3 seconds and then faded back to ""normal star"" brightness or ""average"" star brightness, and they continued to move in the line of 2 across the sky at the same speed, never changing direction that we could tell, and staying the exact same distance apart.  They never stopped, either.  We watched these two things move out of view and fade until! we could no longer see them.  They did not flash, blink, move strangely, or change movement, they glowed once simultaneously together very brightly.  No trail.  There were no sounds.I tried to get video but t was too late, and too dark.My husband is a technician, and I am an artist.  We have 2 kids who were both in bed at this time.  We were not drinking and we do not do drugs.  We often spend a lot of time on our deck with our garden and chickens.We have never seen anything like this before.  Not long after (about 10-15 minutes), I did see what appeared to be a satellite in the sky, similar to the above mentioned objects, but only 1, moving in the same direction, but directly above my head, it never grew bright or glowed, it remained exactly the same until it was out of site, and it also appeared to be moving faster than the other two objects so because it seemed different and much like other satellites we have seen, I assumed this third object was indeed a satellite but I thought I should mention it.Thanks.",Duration:1 minutes,"Location: Irmo, SC",Occurred : 4/22/2017 21:34  (Entered as : 04/22/2017 21:34),Posted: 4/28/2017,Reported: 4/22/2017 8:14:23 PM 20:14,Shape: Unknown

The lights were moving very slowly.  A couple of lights moved vertically, and then hovered, and then a couple moved laterally very slow.  One of the lights rose and then faded into nothing.  Another light faded when an airplane seemed like it was getting close to it.  One more light rose and then faded into nothing, until the last light descended in altitude and finally disappea! red altogether.  The lights seemed to be quite a distance from us.  I would guess they were probably 20 miles away, and maybe 5000 to 8000 feet high.

It had only been about 5 minutes since the first observation.  I was looking west; the sun was setting, when I saw a quickly moving object traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  It appeared silverish and spherical.  It was either quite high or very small.  Then I saw another object which seemed to be trying to overtake the first one, and another one and another one, 6 in all, following the first one.  Of course my first thought was helicopters but we did not hear any kind of mechanical sound.  It finally occurred to me to use my cell phone and try to get a picture.  All I got was small dots, but they are there.  The time was 8:07.  Interestingly a helicopter did fly over to Boone Hospital and it was easily seen and heard of course! it was landing.As an addendum to this report, a friend, who lives in Salem, Missouri, “was entering Columbia on 63 Hwy and saw a white glowing object between 500 and 1000 feet in altitude going over the Femme Bonne Creek.

My husband, who was driving, and I, were traveling east on East Broadway.  We were between Broadway Bluffs and Trimble when I noticed something very low in the sky in front of the car.  It appeared pale blue in color, almost sky color, about the size of a pea at arm’s length, maybe slightly larger.  It was on the passenger side of the car, so I had a good view of it, it seemed to be spherical.  I did not see any appendages, it appeared very smooth.  We stopped at the light at Trimble to make a left turn which gave me time to watch it.  (My husband watched in the rearview mirror.  He confirms my observations.)  At this point I’m thinking it must be a balloon.  It stayed at about the same height and distance from the road as it flew west over Green Valley Drive.  It was approaching a tall stand of trees at Hinkson Creek when it paused in midair and rapidly descended diagonally out of sight.  Ok, not a balloon.  Maybe it was a drone?

1860,"ufo that started as a bright ball of light but changed shape.  I am a marines fiance I am sure it was not a normal craft.  it followed meHello I hope you are having a good night, I am the fiancé of a marine who’s MOS is Mechanics for large helicopters and planes.  I am familiar with a lot of air crafts because of it.  I live in Ohio.  I was traveling from the Kent University campus to my parents’ house in Uniontown, Ohio.  I was taking a lot of back roads and highways that cut through the countryside, it was mostly corn fields and trees with the occasional house.  Neither of which was lit.I had been on the road for about 5-6 minutes after leaving the Kent campus when I saw the ufo.  I first passed it off as a plane with its headlights towards me (the ufo was a fair distance away at this point so it looked small enough to be a plane)  The only thing that initially made me think its flight path was weird was that it almost seemed to be hugging the tree line from far off, I thought that was low.  I was stopped at a stop light at the time, and I made a choice to ignore it.  But when the stop light turned green, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the object shoot across the sky at a speed I’ve never seen before, and it stopped about what I’m guessing gave it about 5 miles of distance between me and it.That fast movement scared the crap out of me.  I immediately gunned it and took off down the road.  I would occasionally glance around at the sky to see if it followed me because it scared me, but I thought I lost it for a while.  I didn’t see it again till I turned onto the road called Switzer street in Uniontown.  It was sitting dead ahead of me all the way at the end of the road.  It looked like a very bright light at this point I couldn’t make out the shape of the craft because of it.  I just saw the giant ball of light.  At this point it was about half the size of a full moon.I gunned the gas again and made it to my parents’ house and ran inside.  They knew I was coming so the door was unlocked.I didn’t tell my parents about it initially.  I didn’t want them to think I was crazy but when I was leaving the house later, I asked my dad to walk me to the car because I was still unnerved.  He agreed to.  As we walked it showed up again between the tree line.  This time my dad saw it first and told me to look in its direction.“What ((words deleted)) is that?” my dad asked, as he walked a bit closer to the edge of our property.“I think its probably just a plane.”  I responded.  I really didn’t want to call it a ufo at that point I was honestly freaked out and was trying to explain it away.“That’s not a plane, it’s just sitting there not moving.  Planes don’t do that.”  He said, exasperated.No sooner did he say that did the air craft slowly start moving so it swung around and stopped above our back yard.  Still at the same far distance.My dad was spooked at that point and told me to go back in the house with him.  I refused, I wanted to get back to Akron.  I did not want to stay in the country side anymore.  He argued with me, but eventually let me go, if I promised to call him as soon as I got back.  I agreed and climbed into the car and locked the doors.  I watched dad run back inside.  When I looked up at the sky again the ufo was gone.  It was a clear sky tonight. that shouldn't of been possible for it to just disappear like that.I felt a pit in my stomach I did not like what was going on one bit.  I pulled out of the drive way, paranoid, and still watching the sky.  I took off and turned on to a road called Cleveland, Heading back towards Akron.It was a few minutes before I hit my first stop light. It was a red light again.That’s when the ufo showed up again this time it was close!  It was directly above the powerlines that were running up the side of the road.  It turned out its big light and it was replaced with a bunch of small red and blue ones that traced the length of it.  It was very long, almost cigar shaped but thinner.  The lights were evenly spaced out.  Thanks to the lights I could see the ship was about as big as two commercial planes put together.  It had to be at least be 1000 feet in the air still.  Which only leads me to believe it If it had landed, it would have been a crap ton bigger.I gunned a red light to get away from it.  I didn’t see it again till I was merging on the highway.  At that point it was around 10:40pm ish.  I saw the same bright light as I did before, only this time it was at the same distance as it was when I first saw it.  I nervously watched it, it moved out of my sight again, just as I was getting on to I77.  I did not see it again.I called my dad when I got home and explained everything that happened and he gave me your organization's number and told me to report it.I was also asked by the man I talked to on the hotline to give the ufo’s point of elevation.  I am not sure what that is, but I will ask my fiancé when he is off duty.  He is stationed in Japan right now, and they are 14 hours ahead of us, so he’s in the middle of his work day. But I will include the point of elevation in an email along with a drawn picture of the ufo.  I just need to find a printer to scan it into.

1866,"Large and very fast, triangle/boomerang shape with a bright white light in middle and blue and red light blinkingI was driving with my boyfriend and our 3 year old son towards Madison.  We noticed the first one a few miles ahead.  It was very cloudy and very dark and it was below the clouds. There was some very light rain on and off.  We thought it was a helicopter at first only seeing a white light and red blinking light.  It seemed to be moving kind of slow almost hovering.  We stopped to get fuel at Kwik Trip off of I94 at Cottage Grove exit at 9:50. After we left we continued to drive West on Gaston Rd..As we continued to drive West we noticed 2 more and also the one we originally saw.  The other two were hovering and more west closer to the Capital and close to HWY 30.  The one closest to us that was headed west quickly turned around heading East towards us.  That is when we saw how large it was and that it had 3 lights.  A large, bright and white light was in the middle.  It almost looked like a spot light which made us think it was a helicopter, searching for something.  A blinking blue light on its left side and a red blinking red light on its right. It started going faster and had no noise.At this time my son said, ""Look at the plane! Look!""  As he said this, it started to go straight up towards the sky so the under side was visible.  It was clear just how large it was and it was not a plane or helicopter.  It had a triangle shape almost like a boomerang.  Once its bottom was visible it went faster towards the clouds and disappeared in less than 2 seconds.  My son did not see it disappear.  My boyfriend and I both did and it no longer was in sight.  I have never seen anything that large or that fast.  Literally light speed.  At this time we looked towards the others and the one near the Capital was no longer there.  The one towards HWY 30 now was a small red light at this point and was gone in the blink of an eye.  At this point my son asked, ""Where did the planes go?""  We did not see anything else.

1871,"Possible NYC UFO Upper West Side, two sightings separated by four hoursAt around 14:30 I saw a silver object that looked like a balloon.  It floated West, across Amsterdam Avenue and about 65th Street in NYC.  It floated in the West/North West direction, out towards the Hudson River.At around 18:31 pm I was walking South on Riverside Drive, at around 71st Street, when I noticed a group of these same “balloons” floating West towards the Hudson River.  They looked like balloons, but they also looked like UFOs.  They were coming from a completely different direction and time than the one I had previously seen.There were approximately four UFOs in this small group.  As they ascended, they all moved at the same speed towards the sun, making it hard to see them.  One of the objects didn’t float in formation.  It proceeded to move swiftly, heading North, before banking and heading South, now above the Hudson River.  It did this a few times, changing direction smoothly.  At the same time, it seemed to move in the general direction of the other objects.If they were a lot closer, I imagine they would have been relatively large balloons.The objects were silver, and, if they WERE aircraft, I imagine they were small…smaller than a car.  If they were balloons, they were large balloons.The part that REALLY drew my attention was the time difference between the two sightings.  There is no way that the one balloon I saw, descended to the earth, found three more balloons like it, then proceeded to ascend back on its course, four hours after the first sighting.Maybe there was an event in NYC, where a lot of silver balloons were let off…it was strange.

1877,"Large object (Larger than a C130), Unbelievable Speeds, Bright White light that shifts into different color lights, No SoundAt about 2400 hours, I witnessed a bright white light hovering over a house in my neighborhood.  I was sitting on my front porch listening to music, and since I like to listen to aircraft passing, I decided to pull my headphones off.  The strange thing was that there was no sound.  This light was hovering over that house for about a minute or so.  The light was very bright, but oddly enough, not so bright that I couldn't look directly at it.  I'm located in the Columbia area, and I could tell that I was facing north when looking at this object.That bright white light shut off.  What replaced that bright white light was a green and red light pattern.  It's difficult to explain, but the lights appeared to be one and the same, and yet separate at the same time.  This craft still didn't move and I could tell because it didn't appear to be getting bigger or smaller.  I couldn't make out the exact shape of the craft, but I could tell it was big.  It was like looking into the dark to see a blurry figure and you can't tell the exact shape but you can tell how big or small it was.  This thing was huge. I'd say it was the size of a C-130.About 20 seconds after the bright white light changed to the green and red light combination it shot off to the East at a speed that was ridiculous.  This was weird because it went from a stand still, to shooting off at such a fast speed.  There was no build up to the speed.  That kind of maneuver seems ridiculous because that has to be technology I've never seen before that allows an aircraft to go from a stand still hovering position to speeds I haven't seen fighter jets match.  It didn't make sense how fast this thing was, and yet there was still no sound.I couldn't believe what I saw so I stood up and looked around for neighbors.  I spotted one such neighbor who happened to be an Air Force veteran and we talked a lot because I'm an Army veteran.  I asked him if he saw anything weird.  He told me that for several nights he saw the same thing.  He too said there was no sound to this aircraft he was witnessing.  He said it didn't seem like a drone because drones don't move like what he saw and he thought it was weird he never heard any sounds coming from this object.I decided to call Shaw Air Force base.  I got in contact with the command post.  They said they didn't fly anything over my area.  They got me in contact with McIntyre Air National Guard base.  They said it could have been an Apache helicopter with ""whistle mode"" engaged.  Now I'm no expert on Apache helicopters, but I have ridden in one before, and I've seen the so called ""whistle mode"" in action.  That doesn't eliminate all sound nor does it explain the speed I saw.  Even the person I was speaking with couldn't explain why this thing was so unbelievably fast.I'm not sure what I saw.  I don't know what I saw.  I just know that I'm a combat veteran who was deployed to Kandahar Air Field (KAF) and I've seen all sorts of aircraft. I've never seen anything like this before.  That speed, the way the lights were so weird, the fact I heard nothing and the fact that the outline of this thing looked a heck of a lot bigger than an Apache is something I cannot explain.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent, and serious-minded.

Lights were North and East of my position.Lights moved with constant speed but did not follow a constant path.

They were white, glowing circles who moved across the sky.  At first I assumed it was just airplanes flying- but together to make a triangular shape?

We stopped and listened. We then heard a strange noise that I cannot explain..all I could say, is that it sounded like some sort of ""alien"" noise.  I have no idea what they sound like, or if they can even make noise, but I am 110% sure it was something...extraterrestrial.  While we were (low-key) panicking, we then heard three quick footsteps upstairs, going outside.  We didn't hear any door shut after those footsteps.  As we laid there in slice, and fear- we heard another noise outside.  It sounded as if some sort of machinery was running, and made a humming noise.  It lasted for a few seconds, but then the sound faded away.Coincidentally, I feel like these two experiences have something to do with each other.

1926,"Diamond shaped crafts test my perception and direction following abilities.Having only been aware of the extraterrestrial presence for the past two weeks or so, I have been watching the night sky every chance I get.  On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home.After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave.Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words ""Is that you?""  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides.At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly.From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them.There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light.They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky.Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs.The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix.I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet.I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.  I feel like they can hear my thoughts when they are in close range, like they know I'd like to meet them.  I do not feel as if these being have malicious intent, but they may be part of the collective.  I can feel a sort of pressure in the middle of my forehead when they are around, but I can't be certain if that is a placebo effect or not as I have read about the pineal gland and how many consider it to be the 'third eye'  I plan on investigating further.",Duration:90 minutes,"Location: Phoenix, AZ",Occurred : 4/14/2017 23:00  (Entered as : 4/14/2017 23:00),Posted: 4/20/2017,Reported: 4/16/2017 10:47:35 AM 10:47,Shape: Diamond

1933,"Dull object changing shape and flashing while moving in and out of visionIt was a warm night in Malibu, California; I was approximately half a mile from the ocean shore and the sky was particularly clear for a Los Angeles night.  Around 9:30, a friend and I went outside to hammock.  Around 9:50, my friend pointed out a strange ""white, but not bright"" object in the sky.  I looked up to see a large, floating object closer than a plane would fly.  As we observed the moving object, a plane flew high above it (it was descending into LAX), meaning the unidentified object was much closer to Earth than we first realized.I would describe the sighting as not a bright white object, but a dull almost brown shape that was changing size in a repetitive pattern.  It would twirl and become quite large, but get smaller as it rotated - only to be large again within seconds.  I would estimate the size of it to be fifty times the size of a star from the naked human eye on Earth.  Also, there seemed to be a red, glowing light from the core of the flying object.  I went inside to grab some binoculars, and within three minutes the object had moved to the south east towards Los Angeles and had become much smaller, as if it was flying further away.  We continued to watch it, along with a couple of other friends, as it gradually became smaller.  All the while, it continued to move in the same pattern.

The object looked like a plane at first, but then I noticed it was ""hovering"" over the one spot in the sky.  I've never seen a plane hover and it wasn't a helicopter.  It was certainly smaller than a plane, but bigger than a hand held drone.  It wasn't someone paragliding either (which is common in the region).  It looked like a distorted shaped black object slightly elongated, just hovering in the sky.  I drove off the expressway and looped around and still could see it in relatively the same spot as I drove closer to it.

1973,"Very fast moving bright blue/white lightTraveling home from Chapel Hill, NC, last night (April 12, 2017, at about 8pm) towards Monroe, NC (driving southwest), I observed a very intensely bright light ball moving extremely fast across the sky near Asheboro, NC, but in the rural part of Randolph County.  This was obviously not a plane or helicopter because of the lack of signal lights and the absolutely incredible speed.My first thought, after ruling out planes and helicopters, was perhaps that I saw a *huge* meteor; but, the object was different enough that I couldn't rationalize a meteor.  For example, it did not appear to travel like meteors I have seen in the past which appear high up in the atmosphere and quickly burn out.  In terms of assessing the possibility of larger, lower flying meteors, the object did not have the characteristic ""burn trail"" or ""tail"" that a low burning meteor typically has (at least in my experience of seeing photos of low meteors).  This object was clearly moving horizontally across the sky at what appeared to be a constant altitude with no trail.The object was an intense blue/white light ball, and it appeared to have a very slight haze near it, but this ""haze"" could have been an optical illusion, given the brightness of the object and the speed with which it moved.  Any ""haze"" that was present was no larger dimension than the diameter of the light ball, so it did not seem to fit with a meteor trail.I first saw the light ball when it was just about the center of my windshield as I was driving.  It moved to my left, traveling southeast, and across the sky to the horizon or tree line in an elapsed time of only about 3-4 seconds.  So, this light ball was clearly moving at an incredible speed whether low in the sky or higher than I suspected.  I estimate it to have been lower than 500 feet, but that is clearly only an estimate, as I have no way of knowing its true size or altitude.Again, unlike a meteor, the object did not burn out - it simply moved out of my sight at great speed.  Regardless of what it was, it was a fascinating experience.  This is the second time in the past 2 years that I have seen a fast moving object in the general area of central NC, once it the daytime (a ""craft"" of sorts previously reported here) and this bright, nighttime ball of light.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport,In response to your questions (my answers are given in brackets):As you faced the object, what was the approximate direction you were looking  [I was on the road, so I only know the general cardinal direction, assuming a line between Chapel Hill and Monroe, NC.  I did not think to look at my car direction indicator, so the best I can say here is that I was driving Southwest and generally looking in that direction.  Unfortunately, given the nature of winding roads in the rural counties, I cannot confirm the absolute direction of my vision]..and the angle of elevation above the horizontal plane [I had to move a bit to see it past my visor in the car, so it was up past 30 degrees for sure, but it was not by any means 90 degrees from the horizontal.  My best estimate would be about 45-55 degrees from horizontal line of sight]...Was the object in the northern sky, or the southern sky, from your vantage point, [Southern]..and was it traveling from your left to right side, or right to left? [the latter, right to left]Sorry I can't be more exact with some of these questions.  The entire event took me by complete surprise.  I am pleased to know that others reported this event.  I would love to know what you find out about the light, if indeed you are able to identify it.  Is there a means by which I can stay abreast of any updates?

1979,"Several Large UFO sightings over Bladen County, N.C. between 30 Dec 2016 and April 2017.It had been the fifth time this type of UFO has come to our area, which is our back yard.  The difference has been its size and distance to My home.  Every appearance, has drawn it closer and larger than the last one.  The first sighting was on 30 December 2016 @ 2300 hours.  It appeared and traveled down the street and above My neighbor's house across the street, then it came over mine.  It was so close I could have hit it with a baseball easily.  The neighbor in questioned moved from the fear of the incident.  This first one was saucer shape, reddish/orange, pulsating as it revolted, silently, eventually speeding incredibly fast over head and east off of Hwy 87.  The next two were on 26 January and 8 February, 2017.  These two were very similar in size, though larger than the first on 30 December 2016.  The one on 26 January 2017 appeared at 2145 hours, with three major reddish/orange lights equal distant apart, with a diamond like object trailing it behind and below the craft.  It diamond shape figure eventually joint the major part of the craft from underneath, then flow away as it traverse the trees at a distance.  The next one, on 8 February was huge, yet silent as well.  It didn't create no sound or disturbance of the atmosphere.  It remained steady state for approximately 45 minutes, if not more, because I was lost in its beauty.  This one too hard the three reddish/orange glow of lights, equally distant from each other and a trailing diamond shaped object.  The only difference with this observation was that the craft was larger than the last and the diamond shaped object moved more distal from the main object and freely over the neighboring homes and streets and tree lines.  The observation was the 11 April 2017, and without a doubt, the largest ever observed, and not just by Me, but by My entire family.  I've waited a long time to be vindicated by this current sighting, because all the others were seen by Me and when reported to My family, it was received rather unappreciated.  Then this sighting! occurre d and I was vindicated.  Like I said this one was the largest of them all, were every detail could be observed by everyone.  It too had the three reddish/orange lights equally distant, the bottom base could be seen perfectly, which demonstrated were the diamond shaped craft would descend from and the full range of what else there was underneath the UFO.  The bottom part, as I said, had the diamond shaped craft, along with what appeared to be a silvery bracket holding it in place, with some lighting as well.  You could see the way the edges of the UFO curved upward, all the way around.  The top seemed like a shimmering light blue glow about it. Once again, it was silent, and I expected some sound, considering the size of this UFO. The size, without question, had two be 3 and half times the size of My house, because as it traveled over it. It had extend equally on both ends, which would make it over 3 times 76 feet in diameter, since My home is 76 feet long.  Making it more than 275 feet in diameter.The only thing I question id why now? Why these recent visits to My area, and almost the exact same area.  Truth be told, since moving out to this area in 2005, I've since UFOs land near by, even to the extent of leaving circles in My back yard.  Some time floating between My property and My neighbors, but never this large or this close.  There must be something going on around here, if not with Me, since I've had several experiences in My entire life with these things, and for generations apparently.((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1985,"White light traveling fast across the sky.My wife and I were just happen to be looking up in the sky as we were taking our dog for his final ""potty break"" for the night.  While I was looking up, I saw a light of an object traveling at a much faster speed of a typical airplane or any other object that I could identify.The time was 8:40 pm.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  I was facing east and looking at the moonrise just beneath Jupiter.  Out to the southeast, I noticed this object that had a white solid light traveling in a straight path to the northeast direction.  The first thing I noticed was that the light was solid and did not flash or flicker like the traditional airplane lights we see in the sky.  I quickly brought got the attention of my wife and showed her this moving object and compared it to the much slower-moving airplane lights in the sky to contrast the difference between the object I am describing in this text.Once we identified this particular object as being so different, we continued to follow its path. It was a straight path.  At first, and as it was moving overhead, the light seemed to get brighter and larger. My wife described the light to become elongated.  The light quickly dimmed as the object continued to travel into the northern direction.  As it approached the Northern horizon, there seemed to be a flash of light (kind of light a shooting star), then the object disappeared.The total arc of its pathway that we witnessed was approximately 90 degrees arc and this took about 30 seconds.  The light was a constant white light. The speed of this object was much faster than any other planes in the sky. There was no sound with this object. Because it was nighttime, we could not see any vehicle.I could not identify what that object was. I looked up the ISS location and found it to be over South America at the time. As I continued to observe the sky, we saw lots of airplanes, helicopters that night. I even saw what appeared to be a satellite traveling overhead with the usual speeds that I've observed in the past.
