After watching it for a while it seemed to have flashing lights and be moving very slowly so I monitored it to see if it was a plane or some kind of aircraft.  I grabbed my binoculars out of my car so I could see more clearly.  It looked like some kind of flying craft with multi-colored lights flashing in blue, red, and green.

I looked up at the moon and was surprised to see what appeared to be the Big Dipper at first, just to the East of the moon.  I was surprised to see a constellation that close to the moon, because the brightness usually obscures stars.  As I watched, I could see that there were not just 4-6 lights, but many more, and then I noticed the entire array moving from East to West.  We moved to a position where we could see more of the sky, and these lights were in a ""V"" formation, with the point of the v heading West in the direction of travel.  After about 7-8 minutes, they moved out of the line of sight, and we went to the front yard where there are no trees to obstruct the sky, and saw an array of moving lights from the Southern horizon almost to the Northern horizon.

27,"On Thursday July 14, 2016, at around 11:30 pm, I went outside for one last cigarette before bed.  It was a beautiful clear night, so I was staring at the stars at the time of the sighting.  I also would like to note I live in a lightly wooded rual area.   I suddenly noticed a single bright object coming from the east heading west directly over my neighbors' yard.  It appeared from behind a cluster of trees and passed over my neighbors' house, before then disappearing  behind a wooded area on the opposite side.There were no trees behind the house, so I had a good visibility.  The house was roughly 80 yards from my porch.  The distance between the two clusters of trees would be roughly about 100 yards.  It was flying slightly below tree level, which I would guess to be about 30-40 ft.  I lost sight of the object after it disappeared behind the trees, and out of my view.The object appeared to be a basketball size sphere, with a silver glow to it.  It also left a trail behind it, also silver, that I estimated to extend roughly 7-8 ft behind the object.  It wasn’t extremely bright, more dimly lit I would say.  It did not illuminate the trees or the ground it passed over.  It was also moving very quickly.  If I would have blinked, I might have missed it.

31,"Round craft with bright emerald lights flashed and disappeared the second time the lights flashed.I was looking up to the east and saw an aircraft flying from the south, going northeast at about 3500-4000 feet.  This craft was not completely circular, and was not quite oval.  It reminded me of the shape of a crown.  I could see the bottom and sides of it. It was moving slightly faster than the planes that come from the north towards Williams airport.  It had only once color of lights.  It had two horizontal rows of bright green lights around it, and around the craft, there were some vertical bright green lights in sections. The top and bottoms of the vertical lights seemed to extend from the craft.  As it moved, I saw a sudden flash of the lights getting brighter, then back to the original green.  It continued moving, and when in mid sky, in reference to my vantage point, the lights flashed brighter a second time.  After they flashed, I saw only sky and stars in its place. There was no sign of the aircraft. Also, there was a rough, low sound during the time I sa! w the air craft, but myself and the other person who wasn’t looking at the craft thought it was a car or some machine in the neighborhood, although an odd sound.  When the aircraft disappeared, the sound stopped. I've seen strange lights over years, rarely, but this was an actual aircraft unlike any that I've ever seen.

37,"Floating light with cone followed by low bass rumbling sound with a different light.I was in the neighborhood, hanging out late night with a friend.  We were sitting at a bench in the neighborhood.  I walked towards his car, when I noticed a light about 350-400 feet in the air above the tree line to the East.  It looked like a star.  Sort of yellow.  From the yellow light was this funnel of light (sort of a cone) that was a sort of orange brown extending at a 5 o clock direction from the light.  Inside the cone were three blinking white lights that alternated randomly.  The blinking lights were spaced out evenly long ways inside the cone.  My friend and I were perplexed, staring at this light, because we'd never seen something airborne act in that sort of fashion.  After staring at the light for what seemed like 2 minutes (it could have been longer) the blinking dots stopped.  Then the cone started to slightly disappear.  Once it was gone, the light began to also fade away. Also forgot to mention that I was a sort of thin smoke pillar extend from the bottom of the cone to about halfway to the ground.  Never touching the ground.  Or even reaching the trees.  The smoke went away first, then the cone, then the light.After that about 1 minute later, I heard and felt a low low rumble.  Like very distant boulders falling from a cliff.  And then over the course of the next 30 seconds the rumble grew louder and more intense.  Parallel to the sound was a light eminating from past the tree line.  I could see the atmosphere grow with light.  I felt as though a nuclear bomb had dropped and the blast wave was imminent.  The low hum/rumble was extremely frightening. I honestly thought I was going to die.  After 30 seconds the sound stopped instantly.  And the light faded.Something else to mention,  I don't know if this is relevant, but there's a retention pond in the neighborhood.  Inside the pond were frogs.  Immediately after the rumbling light, the frogs all started to yip and make noise as a group.

It seemed to move slightly closer towards us, turned at the same point as the first, and followed in the same direction but in a tighter arc.When what seemed to be the exact same amount of time in between the first and second sightings had passed, and it was just getting out of sight, the third appeared.  After turning, this one made the widest arc and came closest to us by doing so.Despite standing in the middle of a parking lot, staring up at the sky, commenting, and recording the encounter, it was as if all pedestrian traffic resumed minutes after the third had passed, and the one person who did walk right by us in the middle of the event didn’t seem to notice either us or the sky.

77,"Two stripes speed across moon in telescope in barely a second; no trees in view. Quickly disappear.Sudden Appearance of Stripes on the Moon  On July 10, 2016 at 9:11 pm, I was taking pictures of the moon through my 6-inch Dobsonian telescope (Orion Skyquest).  I was using the afocal method, putting an Olympus SZ16 camera up to the eyepiece to photograph what I saw. I was not using my moon filter to dim the brightness of the moon.  (I used it later in the evening, but not at that point.)  I took a series of nine photographs of the moon at that point. I had taken an earlier series before photographing stars and planets, and a later series after photographing more stars and planets.  During this particular series, the striped moon appeared as number #6 of 9 photos at 21:11 and 42 seconds.As I was setting up photo #6 in the series, I had the moon in my sights which I checked by eye. Then I put the camera up against the eyepiece and adjusted it until the moon appeared fully on the LED screen.  I had my finger on the shutter button, when suddenly the top of the moon darkened as I watched.  Two dark spots appeared at the top of the moon, and then streaked at high speed from the top of the moon to the bottom of the moon, not quite the diameter because it was off center.  It left two shadowy stripes that appeared in less than a second. My finger was on the shutter button, I barely hesitated for a fraction of a second, and then I thought, “Branches.”  And then I took the picture.I then looked up at the sky.  The moon was high above the horizon in a clear field of vision. The trees in my backyard and neighboring yards were to the far left and right.  There were no branches obscuring the moon. I would know.  I have taken many artistic pictures of the moon behind branches. The view was clear.It occurred to me that a couple of my long, dark hairs floated through the open aperture of the telescope, which is like a cannon barrel, and landed on the mirror.  That would have been a problem for me with subsequent photos.  The best way to test the situation was to take another picture. Less than two mintues later, at 21:13, I took another picture of the moon.  It was clear.  When you compare the two pictures, you see that the striped moon has a dark area at the top, as if a cloud settled over it.  The stripes have a peculiar jagged aspect, almost like a zipper or a series of stitches.The diameter of the moon is 2158 miles.  The stripes sped across the moon off center. My guess is that the stripes covered about 1500 miles in barely a second.  Travelling at 1500 miles per second comes out to about 90,000 miles per hour.I showed the photo to my husband, who has a PhD in statistics and is very analytical. He said, “It's branches.”  When I discounted that theory, he said, “Two hairs in the aperture.”  I told him the hairs quickly disappeared, and hairs do not start at the top and zip across at high speed.  Then he said, half joking, “It's two spaceships flying at astronomical speed in formation.” I decided to report it.I am enclosing photo #6 in the series, the striped moon, and photo #7, which is the picture that was taken two minutes later. A Dobsonian refractor always shows a mirrored image, so the only post-processing I did was to flip the image so that the moon appears with the lit side on the right, which is how it actually looked in the sky.I know there is probably a logical explanation, but I can't think of one.",Duration:1 second,"Location: Montreal West (Canada), QC",Occurred : 7/10/2016 21:11  (Entered as : July 10 21:11),Posted: 7/15/2016,Reported: 7/12/2016 7:44:56 AM 07:44,Shape: Unknown

82,"Possible reptilian being sighting.  Greetings,  I am writing this statement on an incident that occurred on 10 Jul 2016, at approximately 6:00pm.  This is not a hoax, I am not looking for publicity or any such attention.  I am not sure is what I saw was a legitimate sighting and I am more looking more for answers to help me understand if what I saw was an actual alien being.  So, my friend, her son, and I drove from San Diego to San Francisco for leisure on Friday to Sunday.  On our way back, we were driving on the I-5 Fwy Southbound, towards San Diego.  We were approximately 10 mins south of Los Banos.  The scenery outside was barren, no buildings, structures  or people, just dry grassy hills and dirt roads on the sides of the freeway.  I was actually trying to get some rest when my friend the driver said, “What is that?” and pointed to the right side of the road.  I immediately looked over and saw a tall figure about 6 feet tall in a thick black monk/death looking robe with a big hood.  Now this was very unusual to me since it was about 90 degrees outside and in the middle of nowhere.  Why would somebody be walking around dressed in a thick black hooded robe in this heat.  So as we passed it, I had to get a good look at this person's face, so when I looked at it, it looked back at me.  And what I saw chilled me to the bone.  In this dark heavy hooded robe was a being that looked nothing human.  It had brownish green scales with a short snout and its eyes were large and blackish that glistened in the sun.  It was unmistakable even at about 100 feet away and it looked right at me with no expression.  It wasn’t carrying anything or had any equipment with it and it was walking slow and awkward as if it were looking for something.  I was scared to death, especially when it looked right at me, I thought maybe we should pull over and confront this thing, but honestly I was frozen and we kept driving.  I had asked my friend if she had seen what I had seen and her 12 year old son in the back of the car and they verified the same thing.  Again, I just am looking to see if what I saw could be a reptilian and if that is what other people report seeing.  I really wish I would have pulled over and went back to get some evidence or a picture, but after reading some articles on reptilians, I feel I made a wise choice.  I read that there may be entrances to their habitats in rural areas that may be unseen or hidden from humans.  That may indicate that there may be a entrance by Los Banos off the I-5 fwy going south.  I am not sure if other vehicles traveling down the road with us witnessed this sighting but it did happen and I am willing to swear an oath on it.  I also had unusual experiences that happened when I was a child that I believe was contact with Grey Aliens which is foggy, but I have some clear recollection and memories of some incidences where I may have been abducted and my mother can vouch for that and has some insight on that.  But that is another subject.  This is the first time I have seen a being like this.  Again, I am reporting this to hopefully gain some help to determine if what I saw yesterday could have been the real deal.  And I respectfully ask for discreetness in this matter.  Thank you for your time and I hope you can help me.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and we were impressed by his eloquence and apparent sincerity.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  We have invited his friend and her son to submit additional reports, and we have invited the source of this report to submit an illustration of what the face looked like.  He reports that the creature had a prominent snout, like that of a dog, and that it had scales on its skin.  The witness states that he was formerly a member of the U. S. military.

83,"four lights in a line in the evening skyAt approximately 8PM on the evening of July 10th 2016, witnessed, with two others, four lights in the western sky over the San Fernando Valley area of California.First observation was a close cluster of two green, a blue and a red light, blinking intermittently and relatively close to the ground - approximating 3/4 mile, at 75 degrees above the western horizon.The objects spread apart and actually seemed to move in a horizontal plane, while blinking. The lights were on a non-repetitive pattern and of uneven strength.We managed to obtain both still photos and video of the objects, as the illumination was quite bright, especially the green spectrum.First assertion was that the objects were balloons of some sort, as their lights diminished over time, ( perhaps 7 minutes) as if they were drifting higher and seemed to move with contrasting winds of various altitudes.",Duration:7-10 minutes,"Location: Van Nuys, CA",Occurred : 7/10/2016 16:30  (Entered as : 07/10/16 16:30),Posted: 7/15/2016,Reported: 7/11/2016 8:56:04 PM 20:56,Shape: Light
84,"Silver flicking light hovering over ocean.My family and I were taking a vacation to Bay Head and were on the beach most of the morning.  At approx. 1:30 PM we notice something reflecting and flickering up in the sky over the Atlantic  (At least a few miles off).  We watched it for almost a 1/2 hour, I took a picture of it with my cell phone, poor quality, but it moved slowly, then stopped and hovered, as if it was observing the beach or something in the ocean beneath it.  It was silver/white, no sound. I wondered at first if it wasn't a satellite, space station or debris, but it didn't move.  (I've watched the space station go overhead at night and it moves pretty fast, this was stationary)  The moon was also visible that afternoon and it was to my left of the moon.  I thought maybe a star or a planet, but then at that hour of that it would have to be something pretty damn big/bright.  It was too high and flicking too fast to be Mylar Balloons.  What struck me most was that I had watched a TV show about the origin of Crop Circles in England the day before.  (How they think a majority of them are hoaxed with boards and ropes, but how some of them seem have damage to the ""nodes"" in the crops themselves, which shows excessive heat/radiation exposure etc.) Anyway, there was a video man and his girlfriend took, while sitting on a hill of the valley below, a crop circle, and a farmer working his field (Approx. 1 mile below). A light flickered through the video, to the crop circle, made a 90 Deg. turn and went over the farmer, who didn't notice it, then the light disappeared. The flickering light we all witnessed on the beach that day, looked A LOT like that silver flickering light the man in England had video taped.  Coincidence, I honestly don't know but, I quietly made the connection in my mind the minute I saw it.  Shortly after we saw it, we left the beach to head home for the rest of the day.  There was a pod of dolphin  (They call it the 2 PM Dolphin Show, in Bay Head) and we stopped to watch.  I looked up in the direction of the light again, and it was gone.  We went to Point Pleasant the second day and I didn't see it.  If you zoom in on the photo, the shape is distorted, so it's hard to tell what it is really.

89,"I just came inside and its 3:32am now.  At about 1:56 am, I woke up to let my dogs out and I noticed a bright triangle shaped orange light flashing.  I can't tell exactly how close it was, but it caught my attention bc of how bright and odd shaped it was.  The lights didn't twinkle or have a glow like stars or planes and it looked like it was moving closer while moving to the right.  It looked like it could have been coming from MaKena towards Kihei.  The lights rapidly moved up about an inch, moved back down and then back and fourth.  It looked like it was moving closer and I got scared and came inside.  It made me feel watched.  I then came in my room and looked out the glass door and have been glued there for over an hour and a half now.  The light has moved in circles throughout the sky and moves unlike anything I have ever seen.  I have been trying to wake up my friends to get someone to see what I am but have had no luck.  It's moving across the sky and is on a completely different side of my window to where I've had to move.  Its movements unlike anythjng I have ever seen.  I don't know what to make of it.  I also started to look around this oddly moving shape so I started  comparing it to others and there are several more all around that area.

91,"My husband and I saw a bright Neon orange orb fly to the sky for about a minute.My husband and I were sitting outside on our apartment front porch when I saw a bright orange light coming from behind the trees northwest of us.  As it came from behind the trees it was obvious it was not a plane, drone, or helicopter because of the size, brightness and consistency of the light source, and also how low it was and how fast it was going.  The color of the orb was bright neon orange, and it did not look like head lights, or any other lights I have ever seen before, but it had a glow to it.  I got up and started video recording it, from our point of view it flew south towards the back of our apartment building, but was further past our apartment, then started going east then back south east.  In that process, the light dimmed a little bit then they dimmed even more and within a few seconds it disappeared.  When I say the object starting going different directions, I don’t mean sharp movements, but just slowly turning in those directions.  Also, besides the other factors I mentioned before about it not being a plane I could also tell it was different because of the way it flew it was obvious that the way it was never in seen in a perfect straight course line like planes are seen doing.  My husband as well as my neighbor, the whole incident lasted about a minute to a minute and 5 seconds long.  I do have a video that is 46 seconds long but because it was a cell phone recording you cannot see the orange glow.

96,"Lights/Orbs seen crossing the sky with no noise.This event happened on the night of July 9, 2016, at approximately 10:15pm.  At the end of a week-long camping trip, myself and a friend and his son were staying with friends at their cabin on an island in Case Inlet in Puget Sound, just north of Olympia, Washington.  My friends’ cabin is on the south-west side of the island.  The day had been mostly overcast and breezy, but the clouds had been clearing off in the evening and the breeze had died down.  All five of us were enjoying the evening conversations on the lower deck, standing around a campfire we had built in the pit.  I started to walk up the path towards the upper deck and the cabin when I noticed an orange light/orb rising up through the trees, towards the center of the island.  It really surprised me because the light was very bright and very orange/red and seemed out of place.  I turned back to the other four people and asked “what is that?” as I pointed to the sky.  They we perplexed as well.  The light looked like an orange or red LED light.  It was very intense.  I thought it looked like fire, but with no flickering.  We thought that maybe it’s a firework floating under a parachute, since the day was just past the fourth of July.  But the light continued to rise and come towards us from east to west and slowly arched towards the north.  The breeze that was blowing around 5 to 10 mph, was blowing towards the east, so the light was traveling against the breeze.  As the light arched to the north and was almost above us, it suddenly blinked out.  I mentioned to the others that it made absolutely no noise.  I would estimate the light/orb to be approximately 800-1000 feet high.Just as the light “blinked out,” another light appeared from the same area as the first and began to come towards us.  It took almost the same path in the sky as the first, but came further to the west.  Again, no noise and it arched towards the north and disappeared above us.  This time I noted the light was higher, but still below the clouds.  We again began conversing as to what this could be.  Someone mentioned a drone.  But no noise and why would its lights turn off above us?  Someone else asked if it could be military flares.  But no variation in the light and no smoke visible or no parachute.  Maybe a paper lantern?  Again, no variation in the light like a flame would make.  And why were they moving against the wind direction?  Again, just as that light disappeared, another rose through the trees, followed immediately by a fourth light.  At this time my friends wife and I began walking through the yard and around to the front of the cabin and on the road to get a better view.  My other three friends remained in the back yard.  Both lights traveled the same but slightly wider arch across the sky, moving about the same speed as a small airplane would move.  Both of those lights disappeared behind some trees that were blocking our view now.  A fifth light appeared from a slightly different place (or maybe us changing our location made it seem as so).  As this fifth light moved across the sky I heard the sound of a small airplane approaching.  I turned to the south and saw the plane flying towards the light.  I could tell it was an airplane.  The sound and the navigation lights, definitely an airplane.  The plane flew what looked like beside the light, but I noticed the light was a little lower than th! e plane.  I lost track of the airplane, but the light was straight above us and it had stopped in the sky.  This time I took a very good look at the light.  It looked like fire, but with absolutely no flickering of the light.  It had the intensity of LED lights, both red and orange like in a small cluster.  I noticed stars above it, because the sky was clearing.  As the light was stopped straight above us, it also blinked off.  I looked at my friends wife and she looked at me and we both asked each other “what are we looking at?” and “what is this?”  I told her I was going to my car and getting my dsl camera.  I also grabbed a very powerful flashlight.  I remembered all of our cell phones were inside the cabin being charged.Another light rose through the trees as I returned with my camera.  I tried to take a photo, but the camera only flipped up the flash and wouldn’t take the picture.  Too dark.  I took out my flashlight and turned it on and shown it directly at the light which was now moving directly above us.  The orange orb stopped in the sky when I did this.  I was flashing my flashlight on and off.  My friends wife looked at me and said “what are you doing?” In my mind I suddenly realized that I might not want to signal this thing.  I turned the flashlight off and the orb again moved across the sky.  As it got to our north, it also blinked out.  I guess I was trying to see if there was a balloon or parachute holding up these lights.  I saw none.After these six lights, there was no more.  We waited for another 5 minutes and saw nothing.  It was getting cold outside, so we decided to go in for the night.  My friend (the owner of the cabin) went down to the lower deck and made sure the fire was out.  When he returned to the cabin, he said there was one more orange orb that appeared.  The whole evenings events lasted approximately 30-35 minutes.The next day we discussed the occurrence from the night before.  Two of my friends seemed to laugh it off.  The other three of us were still perplexed.  I have never seen anything like this before and I cannot get it out of my head.  I checked on the internet and ran across the UFO reporting website.  While scanning through the sightings database, I came across a report from the town of Enumclaw, Washington 5 nights prior to our sighting.

101,"An object that appeared to be on fire passed laterally over open water then rose rapidly into the sky.We saw something in the sky we cannot explain.  Started lower than a plane and was definitely on fire.  Moved steadily across our field of view.  Within minutes, it rose and ultimately went completely out of sight. Way too big and fast to be a paper lantern gone awry.  And it moved up, not down, so also not a meteor or anything falling to Earth.My 11 year old son saw it from the couch and pointed it out.  I couldn't see it because of the glare of the inside lights.  He ran to the slider and we went to the balcony.  We live on the open water of Tampa Bay, so we have an unobstructed view of a large area of sky.I yelled to my husband upstairs to look out the window in the sky.  He came downstairs and by then it was already out of sight of our balcony, around the building, but still low.  We all rushed downstairs and out the front door and by then it was already high enough to see over our 3 story building.  Hubby was also puzzled and ran between the buildings to get a better look.  By the time we got there it was really high.

106,"Daytime UFO sighting over Washougal, WA, with PhotosFirst pictures are from where the cloud is overhead.  I noticed weird clouds and took these pictures from the home of a friend with her camera.  after this we proceeded to drive to the local walmart a few mile away.  On the way back I noticed the same clouds, but now with dual weird rainbows, real dark with a fireball like plum coming accompanying it.  I had my friend pull over to a suitable place to snap some more photos at a local marina some 5 miles from the clouds that are still situated above her house, this being after an hour shopping.  I start snapping pictures and within 2 seconds the whole cloud cloak, falls off the UFO, and reveals  a  3 sided pyramid, laying on side, with fireball plum coming off rear and intense rainbow at nose.  There is a second rainbow similar but not as intense.  I have no clue why it did not come out in the pictures.  the hypotenuse sides of the UFO were sharp and straight in completeness.  But on the facades you could see ! relief with louvers, portals, appendages etc. visible.  The other witness is viewing the same thing with complete amazement like myself.  It never moved, and being at 5pm I am facing due east so the sun was at my back.  We got back in car and by the time I looked up again it was cloaked and the rainbows were gone.  While looking at the peripheral of the situation I felt as if there were other craft in close proximity but cloaked by dark clouds. On a side  note, I have a couple of friends who independently at the same time saw from below these clouds dual concentric rainbows overhead.

120,"To whom this may concern:  Hello.  My name is ((name deleted)).  I am almost 32 years old and have been a resident of Cape Coral/Pine Island, Florida, for about 28 years now.  I like to think that I know the area very well and I am familiar with most normal flight paths around.  What myself and two other people saw in the night sky on July 8, 2016, was not normal in the least.I was driving home with a friend around 10:00 - 10:30 PM EST on this Friday night when I just happened to glance over to my left.  At first I didn't think much about it.  It was only 4 lights at first.  As I kept looking over to my left, paying closer and closer attention to them, there were suddenly more of them, and they were grouping up with each other somehow.  I immediately pulled over into a gas station parking lot and parked the car facing South toward the lights.  By this time it had been about 4 minutes since I first noticed them.After watching these things for a few minutes just the two of us, another car pulled up next to me, asking if we had any idea what these strange lights were.  He, too, had a cellphone camera out, with no luck in getting any sort of video or picture of them.  Now the 3 of us are watching these things move around and  witnessing their amazing and otherworldly maneuvering capabilities for a good 6-10 minutes until they started to disappear.  They disappeared one at a time over a period of about 4-5 minutes, the first two going straight up into the sky, no sounds or big light trails to note.  Another would start to move more noticeably, a couple of them eventually taking a more normal flight pattern and heading to the South or Southwest, fading away til gone.  The others seemed to just fade away into the dark night sky, again, always one at a time.  After a total of about 15 minutes, they were all gone.THE only video that came out with ANYTHING will prove only that someone else, someone not in the car with us originally, stopped for the same reason we did...  To safely witness what I know was an amazing atmospheric anomaly!  It was an experience that I will never forget and I am more interested in the unknown now than I've ever been.

138,"Starlike Object ObservedI was completing a report to the MUFON web site regarding an object that was caught on my vehicle's dash cam and wife's cell phone on June 16, 2016.  While near completion of the report, my wife called me outside to observe 2 objects.She told me 1st object was moving very rapidly across the sky while the 2nd object was moving more slowly.  By the time I got outside I couldn't find the 1st object but I did see the 2nd object.It was moving from west to east, was reddish/white in color, and was a little larger than a star.  I ran back inside the house grabbing my Sony 8mm night vision camcorder.  I was able to record approximately 2:50 of footage of the object.  My camera did have difficulty focusing on the object so it does go in/out of focus; however, I did manage some good footage of it.  The footage appears black/white/greenish due the night vision mode so the colors we observed will not be visible.  I converted the 8mm tape to a digital format so that it can be available for online viewing and uploading.Eventually, it disappeared into the night sky as it continued eastward. We did not hear any noise during the entire observation.  My family has observed similar objects near our residence the past few months.  I personally have seen strange objects in the sky, once on the ground, most of my life but this represents the 1st time I have made efforts to record them.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello -This is a follow up regarding a report I made to NUFORC today.

139,"Constellation of 14 to 30 dim lights, 3 bright blue lights performing maneuvers.On Thursday, July 7th, 2016, two friends and I were leaving the Star Pass Resort in the Tucson Mountains, west of Tucson, at about 9:30 or so.  After having dinner there, we walked out the east side of the resort headed to the parking lot.  We looked up into the northeastern sky to see a group of “stars” all of moderate intensity among thin wispy clouds centered about 40 degrees above the horizon line.  Because the night was partly cloudy, there were very few stars visible and I found it quite odd to see so many visible “stars” of similar intensity grouped equidistant from one another.  I thought there were about 14-16 lights. One of my two friends believed there were more than 20. He then exclaimed that they were slowly moving.  I looked closer, comparing the relative proximity of two of the lights and was amazed to find he was correct.At that moment, a bright blue light, the brightness of a significant meteorite and much brighter than the other lights, fell straight down, zig zagging slightly before it disappeared from our line of vision behind a wing of the hotel.  At that moment, two other bright blue lights of similar intensity passed over our heads on parallel paths.  We were swearing in amazement quite a bit at this moment.  They continued steadily across the sky until they met up with the more distant, dimmer lights in the misty cloud bank to the northeast.  This took about 15 seconds.  When they joined the other lights they took on the same level of light intensity.  Then they all faded away simultaneously.I am a native of Tucson, 47 years old with a Master’s degree.

150,"5 transparent rectangular shapes, in formation, at night, over ocean, the lit up shapes moved fast, vertically, then light went out.On the night of either July 6th or 7th, 2016 about 11:00pm-11:30, in Marathon Key, Fl. my husband and I were sitting in front of the Atlantic Ocean, both looking up at the stars in the sky.  There were a few clouds around and a fair amount of stars, which was all we saw.   We had been there approx. 10 or 15 min.  looking into the sky. My husband was sitting to my left and looking to his left, and I glanced to my right.  I saw 5 transparent rectangular shapes that were lit up, in a V or horseshoe formation, in the sky, above the horizon.  They were not moving, they were very large and defined, all exactly alike, covering a good amount of sky, and they were not solid; I could see right through them to the sky behind them.  I distinctly recall seeing a wispy cloud floating by in one of the rectangles. I didn’t see where the source of this huge pattern of light could be coming from, and in an instant they moved very rapidly, all together, upward in the sky, in a q! uick vertical motion and the “light” went out. I did not hear any sound. The sky was then exactly as it had been: dark, with stars. This all happened in probably 2 seconds; I was just about to say to my husband, “Do you see this?” but didn’t have time!  I’ve never seen anything like this in my 53 years and I’m not one for flights of fancy. The only thing I can think of to compare it to (in a way), was some years ago when I was on a stargazing trip out on a boat and the tour guide had one of those laser pointers, which he would very briefly, point into the sky--- I remember how far the light seemed to travel and the way it lit up the sky in the area he pointed to….this rectangular light reminded me of that.  But I’m not familiar with lasers and if they would be capable of doing the above as I described, with this huge shape and pattern.

The vibration around midnight is quiet and calm with the background sound of crickets starting to audibly tune in to the land's energy, or could it be that the sound is tuning the land and the airwaves?  The Stars were a million in the sky.  The New Moon was yesterday, July 4th, 2016.  Tonight's sky was so clear without a moon, that looking at it made us feel as we we were one with all of the vastness.   We are. Yes, we all are.We each had a beach blanket and a chair.  Kaitlynn was on her beach blanket, staring up to the sky as I had my focus on my camera, looking away at the perfect time to catch a bright shooting star sailing across the sky.  Within a 20 minute time she saw 4 more falling stars, as my eyes were intent on getting the perfect shot.  The camera is new to me and it certainly doesn't lie. Ever.  Especially when I'm a little shaky with the hand, it always tells the truth, and nothing but.  My camera is my boyfriend.We sat back in the chairs for one last look before we left.  Kaitlynn pointed towards the pier, slowly following something with her eyes and her pointer finger, asking if I see ""that.""  I saw a blurry, short white line of faint, slow but steady flashing light, that appeared to be moving south to north amongst the top of the low clouds on the horizon.  At first I thought an airplane, but the light was too smooth, too straight, and low, plus we could not hear anything to reference that it was a plane.  A plane that close to the water would echo.  It was silent.  I said ""Someone on the pier must have a laser.""  It did appear that they were shining a little laser light into the clouds, moving it forward.   When it was at the point in front of us, it instantly changed course moving west to east under the surface of the water, directly toward us; dim, yet now, solid light.  Its size did not change as it moved toward us, coming from the horizon.As its distance closed in on us, about 20 feet away under the surface of the water, Kaitlynn grasped onto her chair handles like bracing for something, this was real.  The moment after she braced, it moved to the north a little and emerged about 10 feet away, 4 feet off of the ground, looking like a firefly, then gently hovering just over the sand.  It lingered along the shore momentarily.  Us, losing it in the darkness, like it was hiding it's light.  It came to check if we had noticed it, and we had.  We started to walk towards where it surfaced, but since it was not lighting up, we did not find it and had that certain feeling not to look for it any longer.I would think that it would appear to grow larger, the closer it came, true?  It's mathematical.  This did not change its size, although each atmosphere that it entered, it was a different and a constant other size.  In the clouds it looked like a small plane but mathematics ruled that down to someone pointing a laser echoing in the humidity of the clouds.  In the water it appeared as a quarter-sized white light, over the sand it was the size of a lightning bug and yellowish.  Kaitlynn saw a blue color at some point too.Prior to the sighting, I wanted to hear a song that describes the sky perfectly since it fit the moment.  A few lines are simple metaphors that we all can relate to.  I love lyrics like that.  ""...the sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it."" was this starry night.  The song is Incubus' ""I wish you were here.""  It goes on to say ""I'm counting UFOs, signaling them with my lighter ... and in this moment I am happy.  Happy.""

182,"Red orbs over Buckley, WA.We had invited a couple over to have dinner and watch the neighborhood fireworks.  At 9:50 we walked down to our lower field so that trees wouldn't block our view.  After a few minutes I noticed an orange orb gliding across the sky.  All of the others noticed it and we watched trying to guess why it was acting odd.  I thought it might be a parachute from a firework that was on fire and drifting towards us.  As it got closer, we realized realized it wasn't on fire, so we thought it might be a drone.  The problem with that was it was starting to move faster towards our upper field and during a lull in the fireworks it was almost over head and there was no noise.  It was approximately 500 to 800 feet high.We ran to the upper field to watch as it went towards Enumclaw, gaining speed.  It had started from the direction of Orting.  Of course, no one thought of using their cell phones to take pictures. We were standing around trying to guess what it was, when I noticed that another orb coming from the Sumner direction, heading towards Enumclaw again.  It was about 2 minutes after the first orb.  This time one of us thought to use a cell phone to video it.  Again it moved quietly and fast.  At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my iPad since the phone video didn't come out. The color was consistently a red-orange with no variation in appearance.  There was no clear outline of structure.  The orbs were below the cloud layer and gained altitude as they headed towards Enumclaw.   3 of the 4 of us had been inspectors for Boeing, and one had been an air traffic controller, our facts are accurate. We stood around for about 5 minutes scanning the sky.  To hell with fireworks!  Ten minutes later another orb appeared coming from the South Prairie area, heading  towards Enumclaw again.  This one was higher than the previous two.  I was able to get a very short video and several pictures as it came closer to us.  Another orb followed following the same path about 2-3 minutes later. We stood around waiting and watching and finally gave up on seeing more.  About 50 minutes later, the ex controller spotted another orb, this time coming from the Wilkeson area and heading towards Enumclaw again.  This one was even higher, approx 3000 feet.  Another orb followed the same path about 2 minutes later. By then, everyone was tired and the couple decided to head for home.  As we went inside to gather things up, my husband came and said we wouldn't believe what he saw.  Another orb had followed the last two at a slightly lower altitude.  The orb stopped and split into two orbs and went into the the cloud layer. The first sightings started  from the Sumner direction, and ended coming from the Wilkeson area.

This fireworks display is clearly visible from my third floor (lakeside) deck and I intended to watch the 2016 display but was reading and forgot about it, until I heard the first Boom.  But as I went out to watch I was attracted to a small bright light out over the lake, directly east and moving north.  This was odd because there is never a light out over the lake at night but I thought it was probably a helicopter, moving at about that speed, headed toward Green Bay.  Then things changed.  As I watched, the light suddenly made a sharp left turn and started in my direction (and the direction of the fireworks).  I keep a pair of binocs hanging on the deck door and wanted to get them but was afraid I'd lose the light, now a bright orange and getting brighter as it got neared but finally hurried to get them.  Sure enough, the orange light was gone.  I'd lost it.  So it was back to the fireworks with some disappointment, until I realized it was not gone but had changed from the very bright orange lights to smaller, dimmer blinking ones, obviously on the bottom of something very large.  At that hour of the night, all I could see were the lights but by now the object was much closer, just offshore and slightly to the northeast of my position and of the fireworks display.  And though it was quite dark, there was the impression that the craft was triangular.  It held its position totally silent and motionless for six to eight minutes, as though someone in it was curious about the fireworks.  Then as I watched with the glasses it seemed like someone aboard flipped a switch.  The white, blinking bottom lights (levitating?) went out and the two very large and extremely bright orange ones snapped back on, ambient light illuminating the entire rear (power?) end of the craft, giving me a very clear view.  There still were no sidelights so impossible to determine actual size or shape, only the impression of big and triangular.  It sat immobile and silent for another couple of minutes and then moved leisurely to the southeast until it disappeared over the lake horizon, obviously abandoning its original destination.  Most interesting about this event is what it tells us about the beings involved, that is:  we are not being visited by preprogrammed probes but by ships was under intelligent guidance, they are not from our own future (not interested in fireworks), not our military for the same reason, and obviously not interested in direct communications so far.  I do a considerable amount of rendering and have made one of that part of the craft made visible by the large orange lights which I shall try to include.  Not a computer literate, but will give it a try.((NUFORC Note:  This report was originally posted with a date of June 4th, 2016.

220,"Red sphere seen changing color, intensity and sizeAt dusk on the evening of July 4, I was in my driveway, looking south-southeast.  At about 40 degrees from the horizon, I noticed a small red light, which was rather intense.  It appeared to be moving slowly to the northwest at about 1000' or so about a mile away.  I stopped to watch it because its intensity sparked my curiosity.  I often see planes as we have a few airports and flight paths in the area.  Small planes often follow the coastline but this was moving inland.  At first I figured it was a fireworks rocket, but it had no arcing trajectory.  As it continued in a straight line, it immediately lost intensity and grew or expanded into an ""orb"". As the intensity dropped, it developed a soft orange glowing center. I saw no other lights of any color and no strobe lights.The ""orb"" then disappeared, fading rapidly and not just blinking off.  I assumed it had passed into a cloud.

234,"Bright light beams scan interior of house for two hours on July 4.This email was received by Missouri MUFON Assistant State Director through our website and I thought it would be of interest to you since it is similar to other reports you received: ""My friend and I were house sitting at an older, 1 bedroom house in the middle of nowhere outside Sarcoxie, night before last.  Neither of us has ever spent the night there before and the house isn't particularly nice, or clean and has the portable kind of air conditioner, with 2 large hoses that you have to wedge in the window.  We had moved it to the bedroom and at 3 a.m., very bright lights came in through the area where the curtain was pulled up and to the side because of the a.c. hoses.  It lit up a straight line, going up until reaching the ceiling, about a foot thick.  This continued, line after line, almost like the lights under a scanner.   When we looked out the corner, the lights were so large and bright, it almost looked and sounded like some type of large farm machinery, and there are 2 big fields behind and beside the house.  On the right side there is type of metal barn, then the tree line begins.  It would be near impossible to even fit something like that next to the house, much less turn to go to the back.  After several minutes after ""scanning"" the entire room, it moved to each room in the house, doing the same thing, but not in the front, which faces the highway.  This was during a thunderstorm and the rain quit above the house the whole time this went on, which was for 2 hours.  The thunder and lightning never stopped and the thunder was louder than any I've ever heard.  Almost immediately after the lights left, the rain returned.  It was not a drone or farm equipment.  The closest neighbors didn't see it, so I'm thankful my friend did, or I might worry I'm going crazy.  I don't know what to do or who to call, but I am absolutely terrified.  Please contact me as soon as possible, at any time."" The event occurred at 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. in the early morning hours of July 4, 2016.  ASD contacted the witness by phone and obtained further information.  The witness went back to the house with her boyfriend the next night (actually later the same night July 4) and again the lights appeared but at the earlier time of 10:30 p.m.  The witness was afraid and called her parents to come pick her up immediately, leaving her boyfriend behind. He texted her at 12:30 a.m and said that the lights had finally gone.  The witness and her boyfriend searched the exterior grounds during the day but found no evidence of a landing or damages to vegetation or to the house.The witness contacted me through an email from our missourimufon.org website. I included her entire email in the above initial report.  I spoke with her for over an hour on the phone. The witness seemed genuinely upset about this event.  There was no UFO sighted, however, the strange lights observed for over two hours are a mystery.  The witness said she was awakened by bright lights coming into the bedroom with a beam of light seeming to scan the entire room very slowly, then moving on to the next room and so on until the entire house had been ""scanned.""  She stated that the driveway alarm did not go off, which would have indicated that a vehicle had entered the property.  This event continued for two full hours until 5:00 a.m., then stopped.  During the time that the lights were going around the house, no rain fell on the house even though they were in the middle of a thunderstorm.  After the lights quit, rain began to fall on the house.  This would indicate that some type of craft was possibly hovering above the house during the event.  Also, since the driveway alarm did not activate, this would indicate that this was an airborne vehicle.Oddly, the lights returned the next night and the witness called her parents to come pick her up since she was afraid.  They did so, but her boyfriend, who remained in the house, texted her and said the lights were there from 10:30 pm to 12:30 am the next morning.Her father is a retired psychologist, and is a UFO investigator.  He could not explain the event.Her brother served in the military.The witness seems very credible.Conclusion:  Likely a drone or UFO, but I'm marking this as Unknown Other since we just don't know what it was.

248,"We saw two bright  fireballs in the sky, which later disappeared very quickly.We were driving on Bonaventure Blvd on the intersection Griffin when we saw two bright sphere-like orange red fireballs. They were about 300 ft in the air and about 500 ft behind the traffic lights.  They also seemed proportionately large compared to traffic lights,probably 15 ft in diameter.  They were about two-three times brighter than a traffic light, and both emitted a haze of light around (that's how bright they were).  If I remember correctly, I made out some (maybe 3?) elliptical shaped ovals under the bright light on the left, not sure about the one on the right..  We were facing south and made a turn facing east.We noticed them as we were approaching the intersection at a red light but we quickly made a left turn(east) as it turned green in about 5 seconds.  After the turn I looked back up to see the UFO's however they were no longer visible and disappeared.  I did not see them disappear, but rather after the turn checked to see nothing there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It then hovered for about 5 seconds (showing both red and green lights) and then slowly traveled west behind a building until I couldn't see it anymore.The whole time, this thing made no noise.

256,"Baraboo, IW, 3 red / orange objects east of townAt around 10:05 pm, (July 3, 2016) two people, who were star gazing witnessed three UFO’s just east of Baraboo, WI, USA.  The first was perceived as a dim red, roughly triangular light, point down, about 5° above the northern horizon moving SSW. Inspection with binoculars confirmed that this was not an aircraft, although it sometimes ‘shined’ as if there were navigation lights or a rotating beacon of some sort.  This wasn’t the case as, none were present when examined with the glasses.  While the first continued toward the SW, another came up fast from the SE, heading NNW from behind a bluff (long, hills about 500 feet high, the couple were on the north base of a bluff east of Baraboo).  The object continued to the NE (about thirty seconds to a minute or so from about 45° south from zenith until it passed into the earth’s shadow).	The second object was a glowing red/orange shape, roughly triangular (point downward) until you looked at it through binoculars, when it showed as a bright yellowish light with a soft aura around it to the front and diminishing behind.  Oddly, the red orange triangular shape was not observed.  The light was rather oval in shape. When this second one neared the northern horizon, it faded and one observer realized it had passed into the earth’s penumbra.  This was evident because a black oval continued to travel without any light around it, suggesting this was a solid object that had been illuminated by the sun, rather than a self-illuminated object that had ‘faded’.  While it traveled this way, the first object faded and was lost to view, about 20° from true north.  As far as the observers could guess, it continued on a southwestern heading.	After about five minutes, a third object followed the path of the second where it had appeared over the bluff. It looked exactly the same and faded in the same place near the horizon as the second had, but could not be observed after ‘vanishing’ due to light conditions.  It is not impossible for this to have been the first object that was sighted moving SW, having regained altitude and followed the second’s path.	Other observations:  No sound, no deviation in course.   ""Altitude and size are unknown, but a little simple math applying the altitude of the earth’s penumbra at 22:05 on July 3, 2016, for Baraboo at 43.4711°N by 89.7443°W would give at least the altitude for when they entered the shadow.  Observers assume that this would indicate a descent from a high altitude.  Relative size was approximately ¼ of a thumb nail when observed with the naked eye from the ground.  Overall shape or form is unknown. Although the object was observed in silhouette through 20 power binoculars, the ‘oval’ observed is far from conclusive as far as any structure is concerned.	One witness is a former airport employee and military / combat zone veteran who has a very WIDE visual lexicon from fixed and rotary winged aircraft, flares, bombs, missiles and such. This was NOT a phenomenon of this type, nor did it seem naturally occurring.  There were no navigation lights on the object when it passed into the shadow and was observed for an additional thirty seconds until it blended in with the atmosphere.	No conclusions to what the object was have been drawn. It was ‘unidentified’.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Baraboo, WI",Occurred : 7/3/2016 22:05  (Entered as : 07/03/16 22:05),Posted: 7/8/2016,Reported: 7/4/2016 11:52:16 AM 11:52,Shape: Oval

In my opinion, the object normally would have been invisible to the naked eye, however, because the sun was close to rising, the object was unable to fully compensate for the light and dark with camouflage.",Duration:20+ minutes,"Location: Durango, CO",Occurred : 7/3/2016 04:13  (Entered as : 07/03/2016 04:13),Posted: 7/8/2016,Reported: 7/3/2016 9:44:25 PM 21:44,Shape: Other

278,"Blinking lights on for several seconds getting super bright and fadding out , a smoke orb flying low ,giant green orb very fastThis is getting a little crazy already.  Since I saw my first ufo a few months ago I've been seen them on a regular basis still in search of answer or explanations with no luck .  I'll start by saying I've spent on average 2 hours a night out side looking at the sky and just in the past two nights 7/2/16 and tonight 7/4/16 @ 12-1:45am I saw 3 separate crafrs. Starting with last night.looking toward a mountain range I enjoy looking at where I have seen weird things so I regularly look in the direction to see if I can get any luck on top of this range is a fairly dim  red light(due to distance) that goes on and off as a plane warning to let a plane know there is a huge mountain right there well.  I'll get to the point I was looking that way and I see what I thought was the red light at first but it was alot brighter and bigger didn't think much of it I thought maybe it was just a clearer night well I look about a mile to the left and  sure enough the one I see is! there still dim and remember I look at these mountains every single night and have never seen this light so I look back at the other object and it's blinking but getting brighter then dim then completely fade away for 10-30 seconds at a time then it would reappear in another spot although still close to the first spot and blink then it would even stay lit for 10-30 seconds I called my roommate outside he is not a ufo believer but he knows I have no reason to play games or lie about something like this . And he sees the plane warning light and says that's just a tower to warn planes in case it's dark I said not that. And I pointed and he was in complete disbelief he couldn't even imagine what could hover, blink turn off get brighter and dimmer and even move spots we walked about a 1/4 miles  down the road from our home to get a better look we stayed looking for 30 minutes when all of a sudden. A very bright light seemed to be following us getting brighter to the point we co! uldn't even look the the direction anymore it was blinding we ! got frea ked out and ran all the way home. And we finally looked back and everything was gone and did not come back . Earlier my roommate and I went for a walk to a  bridge close to home where it's super dark at night and I told him I bet we see something he said no way. About 15 minutes of looking we see a ball of what looks to be glowing smoke hovering very low to earth it looked to be far away but close to the ground as it floated along it literally passed my neighbors house it was so much closer than we thought and it went in front of the house passed the house and kept going we attempted to fallow it but it picked up speed and was to quick for us to fallow we watched for a few minutes untill it disappeared though it never change shape never got bigger or  smaller and never got lighter or darker so it couldn't have been actual smoke this was tonight well we finally went inside to watch some TV and wash clothes as I got done hand washing my work clothes due to delicate material th! at will get ruined if put in a machine .I went outside to ring the items out when I noticed two very distant stars that looked super close together so I took out my phone and used the app space junk to identify the stars as I was doing it . I see a flash what seems to the down the road and I look up this object was also very very low to the ground maybe only a few hundred feet it was a green orb biggest I've ever seen. I fallowed it from where I saw the flash and fallowed it as it flew right over my head at a very very high rate of speed and continued looking at the object untill it faded into the night sky this was one single orb I got a good look at it considering the whole event took 10 seconds or less . I want to say I have much better things to do with my time than write this and make things up this is not a hoax I don't need any attention I am just sharing my experience. Call me lucky or cursed  but lately I have seen many unexplained phenomenon in the sky I live in a! mountain area with no light I've tried over and over to take ! pictures with my phone with no luck I am going to invest in a very nice camera I know I'll see more soon . I'd really like to know why I'm seeing so many ufo if they are aliens do they want me to see them its overwhelming so many shapes sizes colors orbs blinking blood crafts it goes on . If anyone can contact me with similar experiences I'd love to chat this isn't a joke this isn't a prank or a hoax I am saying this because last time I saw something very strange . It said possible hoax I honestly felt offended made me not want to post but I'll give it another chance.

287,"Flashing light high above Sequoia National Park on July 4th weekend.Our family took a recent trip to Sequoia National Forest/Kings Canyon to have some fun on the weekend of the July 4th holiday.  The 4 of us (my parents, my wife and myself) stayed at the Montecito Lodge off of the 198 General’s Highway.  We only stayed one night--the night of July 2nd.The lodge grounds have several summer-camp style buildings, each with their own amenities.  We stayed in the main lodge building which includes the check-in and hospitality desk, kitchen and dining areas, recreation room, lodging and a patio on the southeast outside area for dining and lounging.Around 10PM on the night of July 2nd, my wife, my mother and myself wanted to get a look at the night sky. My father had already gone to sleep.  At an elevation of 7,400 feet and a very clear mountain night, we thought we’d take the opportunity to see the stars. We went outside and onto the back patio area of the main lodge:  it faces southeast down the canyon, with a clear view far into the High Sierra’s, with Mt. Whitney hidden off to the left, and the 198 Highway winding down directly ahead, and more of Sequoia down below and stretching far off to the South.At night, the view off the back patio was incredible -- completely unobstructed view of a huge area of night sky, with little to absolutely no local light pollution.  We counted 2 orbiting satellites and a few aircraft at cruising altitude (though the air traffic was far away, not passing directly overhead) and hundreds of thousands of stars.  You could clearly see the Milky Way with your own eyes.My wife left to go up to the lodge room around 10:25PM, but my mother and I stayed out for just a few more minutes.  We were both looking directly Southeast, in the lower 25% of our viewing area above the horizon when we noticed one small burst of white light.  We continued watching, as our first idea was that it was possibly aircraft beacon.  But it then flashed again, with similar intensity but not identical. We both said to each other, “did you see that?”  We kept our eyes focused on the area of sky -- we noticed an extremely dim almost pin-point light drifting upward when it flashed again twice, maybe three times, with in-consistent intensity.  We were both unnerved and were at this point asking each other, “what the hell is that thing?”  After flashing, the pin-point dim light would drift, up then down, left then right and stop -- flash, flash -- and then drift more.  This went on for roughly 5 minutes, and eventually it stopped -- appearing to have completely diminished.  It was just one sole source of light that seemed to be emitting the flashes, then drifting, to flash again before disappearing.The flashes of light were pure white, and very bright.  The flashes expanded to nearly the size of a pencil eraser head held out at arm’s length.  We realize that it was July 4th weekend, but this was not anything like fireworks.  It was also not civilian aircraft or satellite activity, as we had clearly spotted those aircraft earlier in the evening.  The altitude of the light appeared to be 50k feet or higher -- upper atmospheric, possibly--from our perception and location.To our knowledge, nobody else witnessed this, as the campgrounds were very quiet, and most people had turned in for the night at this time.  It was clearly something strange, and we both continued to talk about it for the rest of our trip, knowing we’d witnessed possibly something paranormal or extraterrestrial.Observers' backgrounds:  1) 30 year old male, office manager of a production company in Los Angeles.  2) 59 year old female, retired High School English Teacher from Southeast Texas on holiday in Southern California.The location of the Montecito Sequoia Lodge is: 36°41’41.80” N, 118°52’20.15” W, elevation 7,414ft.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Kings Canyon National Parks, CA",Occurred : 7/2/2016 22:30  (Entered as : 07/02/16 22:30),Posted: 7/15/2016,Reported: 7/9/2016 1:56:54 PM 13:56,Shape: Flash

294,"3 Moving Lights with Large Trails in Phoenix form a Triangle in the Night SkyLights Over Phoenix, AZ July 2nd, 2016 9:03 PM 	I was sitting on my patio in south Scottsdale near Oldtown, when I heard a loud bang.  As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I’m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there’s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense.	I’m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I’ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you’ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too.	Like I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I’m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I’m more than happy to help.

305,"Pulsating cigar shape object going across the sky.On Friday 07/01/16, at approximately 2215 hours, my friend and I witnessed an object in the sky.  The duration of this event was about 10 to 15 minutes.  I first noticed this object because of the light that was being emitted from it was very bright.  It was a clear night and the moon was not up.The object would pulsate with three small pulses that were not very bright and then a fourth pulse that was extremely bright almost comparable to a welder's arc.  The pulses were not in a pattern they were intermittent. It started from the West and traveled East bound sometimes staying stationary.  As this object traveled in which the speed was never constant did not make any noise nor a trail that was left behind.  It appeared to very high in altitude but hard to confirm.  When the object would emit the bright pulse of light it appeared to start from the middle of the object and spread outward which made it look like a cigar shape.Once this object was straight overhead a second object appeared near the original object and was conducting itself in the same manner as the first object.  The second object did not last long however, it lasted only about 3 to 5 minutes and disappeared.  Then the object went to a North East direction and out of sight.

308,"2 Sightings of Silent Fireballs:  Very Fast and Very Low, sceptic witnesses convinced by second showing.8 months earlier my wife and I saw 2 balls of fire flying together in the dusk sky.  They were low and fast and caught my attention because I could not discern their marker lights.  I thought to myself that some hotshot private owners were out for a fighter joyride and acting like hooligans.Their flames made them look like fighter jets, but these were not fighter jets.  They were completely silent and I noted aloud as they flew that we should have at least heard their roar by that point in time and at that distance.  The speed they were travelling would have produced more of a scream at that proximity.They approached from the East in a staggered flight pattern and proceeded South perpendicular from my perspective, single file.  By their appearance at profile, they did seem to each have a craft in front of the fiery ball, but it was nearly invisible.  Truly the size of a fighter jet. Absolutely silent. I was chided by my wife, my witness, for being overzealous in my intrigue.7/1   My wife and I were out stargazing when a single orange fireball made its way into view above the tree line.  I pointed it out immediately and we both discussed its features and lack of markers again, as it approached.  At this time we noticed a smaller, single propeller airplane at a much higher altitude, moving along the same path of travel.The sound of the plane was obvious, yet there was no sound from the fiery object, again.  We watched as it approached from the East and swept South just like the first 2 we'd seen last Fall.  This time, when the object turned South it became obscured by a small bunch of leaves and immediately disappeared.  The bunch of leaves is that of a dying willow, so they are small, sparse and not continuous.  At the speed and proximity of the object, it should have reappeared from behind the small leaves in a fraction of a second and would not have been completely obscured at any point, yet it never reappeared.My wife repeated that it'd come back about 6 times before she realized it'd just disappeared before us.

Then I noticed it looked like it had red lines underneath, projecting outward.  Then I looked around and every star seemed to look like that so I thought my eyes might have been tired since it was 11 pm, way past my bedtime.  I got my kids, 19, 18 & 11 and they all described the same thing. I noticed they were closer than stars, which we could see and were much farther away and looked normal.  We live in town so it’s hard to see stars because of all of the streetlights.All four of us could see the exact shape and colors and they were all identical.  They resembled a star (white), with four lines coming out under them in a shape similar to a penciled hangman.  Two lines went out to the sides (perfectly parallel) and two angled downwards like an upside-down V.There are at least twenty of them and they were all across the sky, in all directions. A few of them flickered, one went out and then came back a few minutes later, a couple seemed to move a little bit but not much, but most never moved and we stayed out there an entire hour.  We gave up watching after that hour but they were still there.There were a couple of planes that flew over while we were out there, so we knew these were not planes.  There would never be that many planes where we live.  We thought about Chinese lanterns since it is so close to the 4th, but most of them never moved.  We thought about satellites, but why so many?  And they seemed really close. They seemed to be just over our town.  I thought about drones, as I have seen a couple but why at night and so many?

377,"Photograph of an unidentified large cylindrical object in the air.This photograph was taken last evening at my house near Bow during a test session with my Leica R lenses and a new Sony A7 Mark II camera.I was shooting at the open blue sky at f/11 to see whether the imperfections on my images were caused primarily by dust motes on the camera sensor or in the lenses.This particular shot was taken with a 35mm f/2.0 Leica R focused at infinity and stopped down to f/11.I saved the images to my laptop, then pulled up each one and put it in Paint so I could examine it closely, and then draw circles around each ""dust mote"" to see if they remained in the same place (sensor) or only showed up on a particular lens.I was examining each magnified photo,seeing that I had also photographed some distant birds flying quite high, and came across what looks to be some sort of large and long metallic cylinder, obviously shining in the sun. You can see that the side facing the sun (right and west) is reflecting the light while the other side (left and east) is in shadow conforming with the sun being lower on the horizon tot he right (west).I did not actually see this object but only discovered that I had unintentionally taken a picture of it after the fact.As I finished marking the slide, I noticed what looks to perhaps be a second cylindrical object, far less clearly defined but it looks the same (lower left).The primary object would have been too high to make out with the naked eye.The object does not appear in any of the other lens shots so it is likely that it was moving.I cannot figure out what this might be.  Checked for the ISS but it had gone by much earlier here and besides would not likely show up with a 35mm wide angle lens.I am thinking that if this is an item inside the lens, it would also be out of focus and there would not be sunlight shining on it.Cannot think of any obvious explanation for what this might be.Incidentally, I have been an ornithologist for 50 years so am a very experienced observer of items in the sky.",Duration:Second,"Location: Bow, WA",Occurred : 6/27/2016 19:30  (Entered as : 06/27/16 19:30),Posted: 7/8/2016,Reported: 6/28/2016 11:34:35 PM 23:34,Shape: Cylinder

399,"Bright red/pink lights hovering over Tampa; appearing ascending high up and disappearing only to repeat pattern 3-4 timesIn our apartment complex, going to walk the dog for the last time before bed.  Looking south, over what would be the Wal-Mart area near Gunn Highway, we thought what a very bright red star.  Amazing to see such a close bright vibrant red star, and somewhat next to it was a red star nearly as bright and also seemingly closer to the Earth too.  Then the brighter of the two just started rising high up into the sky.  Once it got extremely high it would seem like just another hard to see star.  It would flash a time or two and then disappear.  Then the other star next to it moved off to left of it in a westerly direction, and slowly started to move high up into the sky just as the first one did, and then it did the same thing.  It just blinked out.  As soon as it did, another very bright red star popped into existence low into the sky and just sat there, still, not moving.  After about 5-10 seconds, it repeated what it had done before, just as it would be ready to blink out from being seen (it would reach a high level in the sky and then stop; and then vanish from being seen), there would appear a super vibrant red light down low in the sky and this pattern repeated again and again for 3-4 cycles.  We stopped to watch this in complete awe, and then after watching it for 5 minutes, it all just stopped.  About 3 minutes later, 2 very bright red lights/sphere just appeared high in the sky, but relatively low (like when the GoodYear Blimp is very high up, but comparatively low in relation to clouds/stars).  We had a great look at the brilliance of these two relatively close red lights, but then honestly we became a little nervous.  It was just me, the wife, and the dog.  I am a lawyer.

I am at work in the middle of the night and went outside to have a cup of coffee.  We are a suburban area at 400 E north avenue in Carol Stream, Illinois.I looked to the sky star gazing as it is nice out and the sky is clear.  I turned to the north and high in the sky I noticed what looked like a star, but it was moving around.  I could not see a specific shape, it looked like a star to me, but it was not stationary.  The object was moving very quickly and erratically.I looked at other stars in the area and no other star was moving and I saw some obvious planes as they had the flashing lights and moved in a constant direction.  The object I observed moved like a balloon with air escaping or a kite on a string darting across the sky.  I kept waiting for the object to move out of my vision, but it stayed in the same general area.The object moved in all directions and at times made big moves, darting to another area and at other times made smaller squiggly moves like a figure eight or a letter “S”.  I called a maintenance friend of mine to verify what I was seeing and he saw the same thing I did.

427,"Dancing Orbs and military triangular craft Near Mountain Home, IDWas just camping at Brueno Dunes State park near Mountain Home AFB.  First night, we saw stars that appeared to be zig zagging without any noise very high in sky.  Freaked my family out.  Next evening, on June 23rd, 2016, we were sitting at camp and it was about 11:00PM just before moon rise.  We heard a rumble and it got louder....next thing we knew, 2 military Osprey whizzed over our camp without any lights on.  Then those dancing stars started to dart around.  Next thing was crazy...dozens of triangular jets coming from the South (with light on until they killed the lights as they banked over the dunes).  They were coming from Nevada.  You could see the lights of them for miles.  The weirdest part of this is that they sounded like prop planes and jet planes.....literally I have never heard this from any plane.  They banked for Mountain Home AFB and must have been re-fueling because they were flying in holding patterns for at least a half hour then were taking off and heading east towards the rising moon.  This whole time, there were hovering Osprey and/or helicopters in the distance around the base.  As soon as they aircraft activity ceased, the dancing stars stopped too.  My family was freaked out.  Did we witness a maneuver with the latest technology or is our military observing these dance orbs?  I have a couple of pics of the orbs...they were hard to snap because they moved so freakin fast.

429,"Yellowish/orange light observed by two people following a jet airplane.UFO REPORT:  On June 23, 2016, my buddy and I were talking outside the shop building where we work the night shift.  It was a clear night sky with stars visible everywhere.  I heard the jet engines of an airplane so I looked straight up and it was directly above me and it was being followed by a yellowish/orange light.  I said, “Holy ((deleted)), look at this!”  My buddy jumped out of the chair he was sitting in and looked up.  I said, “There’s a light following that airplane!”  He confirmed that he saw it too.I estimate the airplane was approximately at 20,000 feet.  I say this because normally when jets fly overhead at 40,000 feet by the time we hear them they are already past us and high enough up that all you can make out is the blinking lights.  This plane was low enough that I could see the outline of the plane itself, and as soon as I heard it I looked up and it was directly above us.The light was about the same size as the stars in the night sky and was following the plane at about two airplane lengths behind it, and did not appear to be attached to any other object as I could clearly see the stars without anything blocking them out in the background.  The light was not blinking and remained constant.  As we watched, the light appeared to move under and ahead of the airplane.  Then it got closer to and moved ahead of the plane, got closer to the front of the plane and moved ahead of it again several times.I looked at my fit bit and noted the time was 10:55 P.M. Mountain Standard time.  I also noted the plane and light were moving from east to west.After about 40 seconds of observing the plane and the light, my buddy noted that the airplane's navigation light began blinking.  Up until then we had not seen the lights on the plane blinking.I can’t say for certain, but I suspect the plane was a B-1 bomber flying out of Elsworth Air Force base from Rapid City.  They fly into our airport often and the roar of the engines are unmistakable.  This plane had a similar sound to the engines.After about one minute we lost sight of the plane and the light.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  He said that he would try to induce the other witness to submit a report, as well, but he was not confident that the individual would be willing to do it.

We were enjoying dinner on her patio and using a star gazing app on my phone to identify stars and planets.  Below is a description I wrote down shortly after the event to preserve the details.  The first object traveled from the southeast toward my neighbor's house, in a northwesterly direction.  The light on the right appeared first.  I noticed it because i first thought it was a star.  When it moved I thought it was a plane.  It was some distance away (mile or more, so distant it looked like a small dot).  It started coming toward us.  I looked at it a couple of times and continued to notice it coming in our direction, still thinking it was just a plane.  I looked away again, but then a few minutes later, it was close to the roof line of the house at the end of the street (four houses away) and it didn't move any closer.  It just hovered.  The light got much brighter.  My neighbor's 9-year-old grand daughter was with me and said she saw it changing colors.Then I checked my flight radar app and saw there were no planes in the area.  When I looked up again, there was a second one (one on the left) but it was much dimmer than the one on the right.  They were spaced slightly further apart but then the dimmer one approached the larger one.  I snapped this photo just as they became about the same brightness.  They continued to hover there, the one on the left occasionally going behind the roof line of the house.  Altogether it was just a few minutes.  Then I looked away to say goodbye to one of my neighbors.  I helped my other neighbor, whose house I was at, clean up our dinner plates.  We went inside her house.  I didn't say anything to her about the lights because I knew she would be frightened by them.  When I went outside again a few minutes later and looked up, they were gone.  I wish I could have continued watching, but I didn't get to see where they went or how quickly they left.Please note that I live within 30 minutes of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, but as stated above, my radar app showed no planes in the immediate area, and the objects were too close to the roof line to have been planes.  They also traveled too great a distance to have been recreational drones, as I believe they would not have been within eye sight of any operator.  They made no sound.

I was looking at the night sky, nothing out of the ordinary from any other night at this point.While focused in one direction I noticed what appeared to be movement of two regular looking stars…..    The position from my vantage point was directly in front of me slightly to the right at about a 45 degree angle from the ground.As a point of reference I noticed a star at what I describe at top position and another star at a bottom position in a vertical orientation in reference to the ground.  The distance apart is not known but would be from about 20 degrees at the bottom to 45 degrees at the top star looking up from my chair.  On either side of an imaginary line between the top and bottom stars were two other ordinary looking stars on the left and one on the right slightly lower than horizontal.

The two stars on either side of the above mentioned top and bottom stars as a point of reference started to rotate as if rotating around a common axis.  They moved at the same rate of speed as each other.  The two stars both rotated simultaneously 180 degrees and changed position.  The one on the left moved to the position as the one on the right visa-versa.  When they reached the 180 degree position change they both stopped and then started moving in opposite directions from each other until out of sight.

436,"Very shiny object in the skyOn June 23, 2016, I was driving home from work in Houston heading west toward Katy on I-10.  It was around 6:20pm, so the sun was still high in the sky.  It was sunny and partly cloudy.  A shiny object in the sky caught my eye.  I would say that it was like an oval-ish shape, I couldn't see any sharp edges but it was solid.  The reflection was bright and it made it hard to see the actual shape of the object was.  I did not see it appear, I just happened to notice it.  I was around I-10 and Dairy Ashford and it was on my right, north of I-10.  It was wasn't too high but it wasn't too low on the horizon to where the view of it could be obstructed by trees or anything.  I just stared at it.  There was some traffic so I wasn't driving too fast so I was able to see if it had a trajectory path but it did not move, it stayed at the same position.  I was trying to see if it was a plane, but the way that it shone, it could have not been because it wasn't small enough, the reflection was too bright and it would require a lot more surface area.  The shape of a small plane could of not have cast the amount to light or reflection that this object did and from that distance, it would of been too small anyway.  At first all I could notice was the bright reflective surface, but the more I looked, I could see that it was silver on the bottom part.  Again, it was hard to see the actual shape of the object, but it was solid.There is a small airport on Groschke Road that is between Barker Cypress and Hwy 6.  I occasionally see small planes take off so its not out of ordinary for me to see things in the sky,  I have even seen colorful hot air ballons come from south of I-10 in Katy,  I am not too sure where exactly they come from but it has been a while since I have seen those.  However, this object or I guess UFO was rather large but at the same time seemed far away.  If I would guess where the UFO was on top of, I would guess that it was between the Mason Rd to Fry Rd and Saums to Clay Rd area.  So as I am driving I pass under the Hwy 6 overpass and when I look at the same spot in the sky, it was gone.  I looked around to see if it moved lower or higher but it was nowhere.  The Hwy 6 overpass only obstructed my view for about 5 seconds.  The length of time that I saw this UFO was no more than 1 minute. When I first saw it I felt curious and I was thinking of all the possibilites of what this could of be! en. When I continued to see it, I felt kind of confused because I couldn't understand what the object was and when it disappeared quickly I was just shocked and I also felt upset at myself for not taking a picture of it. I am sure that it would of been visible.If somebody knows what this object was or if you saw it too, please leave a comment.  I have been trying to forget or to talk myself out of thinking that I saw a UFO.  I am not one of those kind of people that think that there are aliens out there or those that do a lot of research on conspiracy theories but I cannot explain what could that could have been but I KNOW what I saw.

440,"A fast-moving, pentagon-shaped object rapidly transiting across the norhtern face of the moon.Observation of a Fast Moving Lunar Transit Anomaly Jacksonville, Florida, June 23, 12:31 EDT.   At about 0:31 hours (12:31 EDT, to the nearest minute) this morning, I was observing the waning gibbous moon from our driveway with a 4.25” f/6 reflecting telescope.  At the time, I was using a magnification of about 100X with a # 21 orange filter.  Although the rising moon was still low in the SE, seeing was quite good, and there were no clouds or haze.While observing features on the lunar terminator near Mare Serenitatis, I noticed a fast moving, solid black pentagon-shaped object traversing from west to east [moving from the terminator roughly in the direction of Mare Imbrium] across the lower (mid-northern) portion of the moon.  The estimated time of passage before it swept out of the eyepiece’s field of view was – my best guess – well under five seconds.  As I was not wearing a watch, I immediately went inside and looked at a wall clock (known to be accurate within a minute or so), and recorded the time.The most unusual aspect of this observation was the shape of the object.  Because it swept across the field of view so rapidly, I am not 100% sure that I am getting this exactly right, but my recollection is that its silhouette was something between a pentagon and a five-pointed star, as shown on the accompanying drawing.  This rendering is based on a quick pencil sketch that I made within a few minutes of seeing the object.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that this object was inky black and perfectly symmetrical – with no change of shape or tumbling effect as it crossed the face of the moon.As to the object’s size, I have tried to relate it to some of the named lunar craters in this area, and – again, to the best of my ability – it seems to have had an apparent angular size midway between that of Menelaus (27 km) and Manilius (39 km), so my best guess would be an apparent size of about 30 km, as projected against the lunar disc.Based on its eastward trajectory, moving roughly in line with the ecliptic, my suspicion is that this is some kind of large, earth orbiting satellite – but what could it be?  Although I have never witnessed a lunar transit by the International Space Station, I am familiar with its appearance, both as it has been imaged in telescopes and as it has been photographed traversing the moon, but the object that I observed looked noting like this.Has anyone else seen anything like this?((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides very nice illustration of what the object looked like in the field of view of his telescope.  PD))((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter --Thanks for your follow-up email on the report that I submitted this morning.  You wrote:""You do state in your report that the object appeared to be moving from west to east.  Am I correct in assuming that your statement implies west to east, as the witness faces the Moon, and not as he is looking at the (reversed) image in the telescope?  I think your drawing pretty well answers my question, but I would like to be certain on that point."" Yes, you are correct, moving from west to east across the face of the moon as shown in the diagram.  In my reflector's eyepiece view, everything is of course inverted but not mirror reversed, and I corrected for this in the drawing.  Always confusing.  One of these days, I am going to get a good penta-prism so I can get non mirror-reversed views in my refractor, lol.Of perhaps more interest, I shared my report with a friend, a retired aerospace engineer [His wife is a retired aerospace engineer, too, lol.] who was able to take the data -- with a few assumptions about a probable earth orbit height -- and perform the following simple calculations:((calculation))Hello ((witness name deleted)),You don't need trig for this one, just algebra.30km (object)/ 376364km (Earth, Moon Distance - surface to surface) = X/200 miles.  Solving for X, we get .0159 miles which at 5280 ft/mile gives a size of approximately 84 feet, about right for a large spy satellite or old booster tank.  Likely just more space junk.((name deleted))PS. You may find this site interesting. http://www.stuffin.space/ Click on an object to see what it is.Hummmm.  84 feet is not as large as I thought it might be, but it would seem to ""fit"" the data pretty well  I remain puzzled by the odd symmetrical shape, but perhaps this is the way that some satellites are constructed.  Anyway, thanks again for the follow-up on the report.  My feeling is that we have now, most likely, gone from a ""UFO"" to an earth satellite, albeit of unknown origin, lol.  PS--Yes, you have my permission to post the drawing, and -- if possible -- it might be interesting to post Richard's back of the envelope calculations as well as a postscript, so long as there is no need to specifically identify him.PPS--I always enjoy hearing your segment on Coast to Coast, and hearing about what other people are seeing in the sky these days.  As I have mentioned to you, my only ""real"" UFO observation was made back when I was a kid -- almost sixty years ago, now.  The truly amazing thing is how much data has been gathered about this phenomenon over all of the intervening years, but how little we still seem to know about what it all really ""means.""  Clear Skies --((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM #1))((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2))Hello Peter --       As for my friend's calculations, you are correct, there was indeed some bootstrapping involved, lol.  At my suggestion, he made the assumption, as a starting point, that the object was in low earth orbit at an arbitrarily chosen altitude.  Then, he applied the simple geometric calculations that you see to get its approximate size.          Obviously, if the object was not in this type of orbit -- in a higher orbit, or much closer to the lunar surface -- then it becomes much larger, and far more problematic in terms of an explanation.  The limiting case would be a huge object -- on par with the diameter of a moderate sized lunar crater -- flying at incredible velocity over the face of the moon.  Think Independence Day II, lol.       On the other hand, its [unhappily, not very well] observed transit time can also serve as a geometric limiting factor.  That is, if something is seen to cross the entire face of the moon in, say, five seconds, then this (from the application of simple geometry) gives us a strong indication about where -- and how fast -- it must be moving relative to the earth and the moon.  In this case, all of the parameters, working backward, seem to ""fit"" the more mundane explanation that this is some kind of earth satellite, but it still might not be...Going Down the Rabbit Hole       As I mentioned in my last email, the most interesting / deeply troubling aspect of all of this is that most of us -- you, me, and the Coast listenership -- seem to be struggling to come up with some kind of logical, rational, and more or less coherent and comprehensible ""model"" of what the UFO phenomenon is all about and what it might actually ""mean"" in practice.  Sadly, this is not the model that ""our"" government seems to be pursuing -- cf, the contributions of everyone from Richard Dolan to Dr. Steven Greer -- and we never seem to get much closer to a real understanding of what is happening.       As I remember you observing many years ago, such a deliberately orchestrated denial / obfuscation of reality is absolutely toxic to our form of representative government, and this would help to explain everything from the pent-up anger of the public [The Brits seem to have voted to leave the EU yesterday.] to the near total dysfunction of Official Washington.  We are, at best, living in a carefully manufactured official reality where very little is what it appears to be, including the sundry aerial phenomena that you record every day, and yet nothing much is ""done"" about it.       Unlike the more optimistic assessment of Dr. Greer and others, my fear is that we live in a world in which anything like official disclosure (or even a simple confession of ignorance as to the exact nature and purposes of the phenomenon) may never occur, and The Powers That Be will simply do whatever is necessary to make sure that their version of reality ""sticks,"" even though an increasing majority of citizens know better.  How our present system of government can survive such a dual reality in which everyone knows that its public officials are lying in their teeth about important things is open to question*, but it took quite a while for the Soviet system to implode, and TPTB now have much better ""tools"" with which to mold / coerce society**.*As seems to be taking place in the election of 2016, lol.** See, for example, Jane Mayer's recent book, Dark Money.As a number of people in the field of ufology seem to be calling for at this point [Many of these people have appeared on Coast and in other venues.], perhaps the best that we can do is to continue creating a citizen-sourced, distributed network model type of investigation that simply gives up on the idea the gov'mint will ever come clean with the public in this area.  Instead, we will, I hope, end up with something like a Wikipedia of UFO-related material that will constitute (for most people, probably) a viable alternative to the manufactured ""reality"" that the government and / or TPTB continue to shovel in our direction.  Then, based on this open, public consensus version of reality, perhaps we can begin to ""do"" something--whatever this might turn out to be--about our objective situation vis a vis the things that everybody keeps seeing in the sky.Thanks, as always, for your help with this --((witness name deleted))((END ADDENDUM #2))",Duration:5 seconds,"Location: Jacksonville, FL",Occurred : 6/23/2016 00:31  (Entered as : 06/23/16 00:31),Posted: 6/24/2016,Reported: 6/23/2016 9:44:25 AM 09:44,Shape: Other

464,"Oval shaped solid object non illuminated hovering motionless approximately 2000 ft over the East River of Manhattan, NYC.I am 57 years old and a paralegal for an investment advisor firm in New York City.  I live in a studio apt on the top floor of a 4th Floor walk-up in the Kip’s Bay area on the East Side of Manhattan.  There is a balcony in the back of the apt that has a view facing the skyline looking out over the East River towards Queens and Brooklyn.  I often go out to the balcony on warm clear nights to look at the stars and get some fresh air.  I went out 2 nights ago, on June 21st, around midnight, when I spotted a strange object hovering over the East River.  It looked like a roundish, oval shape that was not illuminated except for the city lights shining up on it and the nearly full moon behind it.  It looked to be about  1/5th  the size of a normal full moon from where I was standing which was about 5 blocks from the East River.  The altitude was higher than the Empire State Building which stands west of my vantage point.  It looked to be at least as big as a house in my estimation.	It was a clear night with just a few small puffy clouds still hanging in the sky near the object and I thought that maybe the object was just a small portion of a cloud but there was a breeze blowing North and the other clouds soon blew past the object and dissipated while the object remained in the same spot and hovered completely motionless.  At this point I thought I might have something out of the ordinary here so I ran back into my apartment and got my binoculars.  I steadied the binoculars against a balcony railing and managed to capture the object in my sights.  It looked oval shaped and had sort of a greenish, grayish color.  I could not discern any details such as windows or defining structure because it was difficult to keep in focus.  I thought I may have seen a few tiny pinpoint size colored lights but cannot be certain.	After a few moments it began to slowly move north towards upper Manhattan and I could see stars passing behind it as it moved.  I could not hear any sound coming from it.  After moving north for a few hundred yards it changed direction and started heading due East over Long Island City in Queens.  I lost sight of it after a very tall tree in a neighboring yard blocked my view.  I waited for a half an hour to see if it would return but it never did.

I was just getting ready to say to my wife, “What do you think that is?”, when she asked me the exact same thing.  To the naked eye, the lights looked like 3-4 round, brightly lit orbs that were somehow connected together or touching, moving very slowly, slightly southeast.  The lights just had a very floaty feel to them – best way I can explain it.  The light on the right side appeared to separate and move away for a couple of seconds, then rejoined the group.  The entire group faded out briefly, then reappeared again.  There were other cars on the road with us and you could tell they were seeing this, too.  A couple of cars pulled over to the right shoulder and stopped.  I told my wife to grab her phone and take some pictures.  We both have new iPhone 6SE’s.  She took six pictures as I was driving.  She doesn’t know how to do much beyond voice and text on her phone, so she didn’t think to use the video camera.  The pictures are pretty blurry from car movement and her trying to use the camera portion of the phone.  We did get the lights, though it may not be of much use.  Included are the photos just as they are from the phone.  This was the night of the solstice moon, but this was not the moon we were seeing.",Duration:7-10 minutes,"Location: Burlington, WA",Occurred : 6/20/2016 19:35  (Entered as : 06/20.16 19:35),Posted: 7/8/2016,Reported: 6/29/2016 2:49:30 PM 14:49,Shape: Light

472,"06/20/16, 3:30 Wisc. Crescent shape Watched for 30 sec. or so Amer / orange lights.I have seen many strange unexplained objects moving in the night sky for years, only because I like to star gaze.  But I have never seen anything like this and so up close.  It was a perfectly calm and clear early morning,  I was taking my dogs out to do their morning duties,  (I get up very early because of my work schedule I start at 4:00AM) when I looked up and out of the corner of my eye, to the southeast, I noticed a light.  When I turned and focused on it, it was moving silently northwest, completely void of audible sound.  My dogs were oblivious of the craft.  This craft was very close, the best way to describe it, was if you were to take both hands and hold them above and in front of your head about 12 - 16 inches apart, that is how large it looked.  It was a quarter moon crescent shape (as far as I could tell by the possition of the lights) and had 7 amber/orange lights on the forward moving part of the craft. We have some very tall, large pine trees in our back yard, and I had to walk to the north to look past them when it flew by and over.  It all happened in a matter of about 30 seconds.  My mind was racing trying to comprehend what I have just seen.  I know what I saw because I am a believer, but my mind was telling me differently. I was trying so hard to debunk it in my head.  So many different explanations were going through my head.  But I couldn't explain it.  I hurried my dogs up and by the time I was back in the house I was shaking.  I don't get shook, I'm 6 foot 2, 300 lbs.  But this got me going. Now it gets even more interesting...  The following day I am on the beginning of my 5 day off shift change.  I am doing my normal early morning rituals to stay on schedule, letting the dogs out so on and so on, etc. etc.  The first 2 days off were uneventful mornings for star gazing.  It was cloudy and overcast.  But on the third day it was very clear so I was looking up and about like a mad man trying to see another UFO.  To my amazement (because I was just hoping not really thinking I would see anything) I saw to the southwest, towards Milwaukee, very high in the sky 4 objects moving about.  These objects looked like stars but were moving in all directions.  I kept an eye on them and scanned the sky with the other and there it was, the same object I saw 3 days earlier but much farther away. It was to the northwest, towards West Bend.  This time it was moving very erratically, up, down, left to right, in circles and in a figure eight type pattern.  This time it was about the size of a pea because I believe it was much farther away.  I watched it for about a minute or so, then it moved very quickly to the north and just faded out of sight.  I thought this may just be a drone but for as fast as it moved and with no sound I have to rule that out.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This time it was yellow yellow red.  As we reached a clearing a little down the road we were able to see the object pretty clearly as it slowly went downward.

476,"Sky opens portal and orb shoots through it and begins to travelDirector@  I was at Costco  store in Burlington, WA, by the gas pumps, just parked my car.  I was checking out my camera on my Samsung Note 4 and I was going to drop the phone and when I went to save it, I accidentally pressed the picture shooter and the camera began taking continuous shots, multiple shots per second.When I was done shopping, and arrived home, I started looking at the photos and realized that one had what looked like it had a funnel that appeared in the sky (which now I think is a portal) and/or sonic boom; the next photo shows the funnel reduced to a round pathway and an orb shooting through.  The following photo shows the orb travelling, as well as the following photo.  Then it looks like a ring develops around the orb.  Finally the orb continues on and disappears.At first I thought it was a cloud (the first photo), but as I zoomed in to the far right, it was obviously a formation of some sort.I knew what the object was because I have read and seen photos of it.  I also know that many think that orbs are just weather balloons or satellites.  I think that these photos tell a different story.  The object looks like it came through a portal that opened up and immediate closed as the object shot through and began to travel.These photos were taken slightly over a second as it was a rapid photo shoot.  These were captured by accident.I am not convinced that it is a weather balloon.

It's pace was determined and it did not float.  Neither of us have ever seen anything quite like it.  There was a clear sense that it was mechanized or moving by its own power.  We've looked at quite a few examples of iridium flares and they are not the same.  This shape was bigger and more transparent.

Within 15 min we heard a distant grinding sound from above us on the large hill behind us, but we made noting of it at first.  But then the sound seemed to travel over us and then seemingly right in front of us.  The sound was like some sort of grinding noise.  I can only describe it as electrical arcing and whirling metal that pulsed, it came and went eerily.  All of the bugs stopped their chirping, and the light breeze blowing through the area stopped suddenly.  We ran under our tarp loaded our guns and, after a moment to compose ourselves, slowly started walking toward the sound, but as we did it seemed to begin to move quickly away towards Indian Ridge, and soon it was gone.Later, as we were all packed up and leaving, driving down the dirt road back to Cold Creed Rd., I dropped my phone under my seat.  My brother stops the car and I get out to get it.  We then hear the noise again.  It seemed to be on the ground maybe 50-100 ft away; but again we see nothing.  While the noise pulsed we checked the sky for drones, aircraft or anything but saw nothing.  Being a Sunday, no crews were working and the NDOC training facility was closed for the weekend.  There were other shooters, but there gun shots were clear and distinct from the noise, actually there were no gun shots while my brother and I heard this noise.Was this a UFO?  I have no idea, we saw nothing.  All my brother and I heard was the noise.   We thought it creepy because it came towards us, lingered, and when we approached it, it seemed to avoid us.  Has anyone every experienced this before?  Maybe have an audio file I could hear for comparison?  Maybe even audio sounds of commercially available drones?

I exited the tent to find out what was causing the pulsing pressure sensations.  I looked all over the small valley and saw nothing.  It was dark but the moon was pretty bright almost full I was suspecting a earthquake, but then I noticed that there were no stars visible in the sky above the valley, and the moon was visible through the break in the trees to my left.  I could see stars all around the valley sky except for the area along Elk Creek where I was camped.  The entire valley was in a shadow and the starlight was being blocked.  I could not make out by what as the object was so large that its span reached from the top of the hill on my left to the top of the hill on my right a distance of about 1500 feet, and may have reached further.  I could not detect its shape until it stopped pulsing and started to lift up then I could tell its shape.It was dark no lights no visible windows or ports, while it was pulsing it was about 2000 feet above the forest, it rose without a sound to about 5 to 6 thousand feet about me, then segmented into several identical shapes and was gone.

To the right of the moon, and slightly lower, I saw what appeared at first to be a bright planet, or a giant bright star, much bigger than surrounding stars.  It began moving to the right faster than the satellite was traveling.  The skies were very clear with minimal thin clouds.  There was a tail to the left of the brightest light and it grew in size rapidly.  It continued to move and grow without a tail visible then it began to reduce in size and stop.  At 10:41, two bright flying objects came from the central bright light.  One flew to the left and the other to the right.  They were traveling fast.  The one on the right increased in size quite quickly and appeared to have at least three separate lights in a triangular shape.  Both flying objects continued until we could no longer see them.

536,"White sphere materializes out of vapor trail.Around June 16th, I was out in my backyard talking on the phone to my friend.  This is something I do all the time.  I live fairly close to the Boise Airport and I see planes coming in all the time.  I also watch them fly over all the time on their way to other locations.In my backyard that day as I was watching an airplane that clearly was not landing in Boise because it was I would guess about a half a mile away in the sky.  I was watching this airplane fly over and away from me and I always watch the vapor trail dissipate as I was doing on this day.As the trail broke up into clumps and evaporated one of the clumps did not evaporate and was in fact a perfectly round white ball.  It looked like a giant ping-pong ball hanging there.  I thought that was odd that it was so round and did not evaporate like the rest of the trail.  As I stood there watching it I was trying to figure out what it could be, I have never seen anything like that and I had a light bulb moment and got excited because I was thinking oh cool I’m seeing a weather balloon.However, as I kept staring at this object it did not ascend, or descend it literally just stayed in one spot so I ruled out weather balloon.  I stood there watching it for about another couple of minutes and then it just was gone.  It just disappeared instantly.  It was a clear, sunny day and there was nothing around this object after the trail evaporated.  It was very interesting, so I thought I would share.I am a stay at home mom and a student currently studying for my degree in education.  I am a down to Earth person and do not go around looking for spooks and such.  I thought what I saw was very strange and I could not identify what it was, not only that but the fact that it just stayed there and appeared out of the vapor trail of the airplane gave me pause.

546,"Yellowish/orange/fiery spehre seen in PA countryside skyAt approximately 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday June 15, 2016, I was driving along a “field road” on a farm between the villages of Hebe and Klingerstown in Northumberland County, PA.  I was with a friend and two of our children, looking for deer.  As I came up the farm lane, directly ahead of me, I saw a glowing/fiery circular object which appeared to be enveloped in a something of a haze, lowdown in the sky, just over a small mountain about a mile or two from my location.  From my truck the object appeared to be the size of a tennis ball, but it was obviously much larger as at least a mile or so away.  The object appeared out of nowhere a little above the mountain and at a rate which seemed slow to me traveled on a downward angle from right to left and disappeared behind the mountain.  I slammed on the brakes and exclaimed something like “what the hell was that?”My friend had been looking for something on the floor, and the two boys were playing a videogame in back, so none of them saw anything.  I expected a huge explosion from the other side of the mountain, as at first I thought it was a plane or helicopter which was on fire and coming to the ground.  However, when no explosion occurred, I had no idea what I just saw.Due to my thoughts that it could have been a plane or something like it we quickly drove to the other side of the mountain and drove up and down the road looking for whatever had come down.  We found nothing.Looking back, one thing that seems strange is that this object had no “tail” such as you might see from a plane or shooting star streaking across the sky.  Further, I have seen shooting stars and this was nothing like that.  It couldn’t have been a plane or helicopter crashing as we would have seen the aftermath for absolute certainty.  As it bothered me for days I looked around Google and found a picture which looked very much like what I saw, which picture was labeled an “Orb” in a setting of UFO’s.For what it is worth, I was not under the influence of any substance.  I have never really believed in UFO’s despite once before having before seen several green “dots” chasing each other around the sky when again out in the countryside of Northumberland County many years before.

547,"Unusual light moving across the sky.At approximately 9:45 pm I saw a light moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  When I first saw the object I mistook it for a bright star.  It was white and moved across the sky at a moderate rate of speed (much too slow to be a meteorite).  There is an airport nearby, so I see planes almost every night.  Normally a plane has flashing lights and has the usual jet or propeller noise.  This object was completely silent.  It did not flash or change color.  I cannot estimate its exact speed or altitude.  Its speed was not unusual.  It moved in a straight line and exhibited no abnormal changes in direction.  It appeared to be flying fairly low in the sky, much lower than most conventional aircraft that I regularly observe.  I cannot claim that this was a genuine UFO, but I have never seen a conventional aircraft that looked like a bright white star.  It was low enough in the sky that I should have heard some sort of engine noise.  Again, this obje! ct was completely silent.

549,"2 credible witnesses saw a massive, &quot;V&quot; shaped UFO, appearing to bend the atmosphere while moving slowly overhead before speeHello sir/madam/Mr. Davenport;  I recently had dinner with friends.  He (38 yrs) works for the local school board.  His wife (34 yrs) is in retail management.  Neither of them is a 'believer' in UFOs.  During our dinner they told me of an incident that occurred in mid June.They were sitting by the fire in their yard after dinner.  After some time, the husband noticed in the sky what he described as a 'V'.  He said it looked almost like geese flying, in that the 'V' was so prominent, but that it wasn't geese, because it was way up in the sky, ""at least as high as an airplane would be,"" he said.  He also stated that although he couldn't see a ""back edge"" (completeing the triangle) he could tell it was more than just a ""V"" because he couldn't see the clouds through the area behind the ""V"".  (I hope that makes sense).He and his wife both described the object as being ""at least 10 times bigger than an airplane,"" and ""dead silent"".   He told me that they both sat in their chairs, looking up at the object in disbelief and wonder.  He stated that it appeared to ""bending the atmosphere"".  They both stated that it was moving, but agreed that it was moving far too slowly to be anything they're ever seen before, and that as they sat there watching the object, it went from ""barely moving"" (for 8 - 10 seconds) to flying away faster than anything they'd ever seen, until it was out of sight (1 - 2 seconds).As I stated, neither of them are believers, yet have no guesses as to what they saw.  They didn't say ""maybe a satellite.  Maybe a drone.""  They were just puzzled, and thinking/hoping I might have some answers.  (I'm 'that guy' among our friends/family).My answer for them was to contact the fine folks at NUFORC and file a report, but it was obvious to me that they weren't going to do that.  In fact, me mentioning it to them pretty much ended the discussion.  Stigma, my guess.  You know how it is.So, I thought the least I should do is inform you.  For your records, and such.  I have known the fellow for over 20 years.  He isn't going to lie me about this, or anything else, to be honest.

Then we thought helicopter??  But it seemed really high for a helicopter and we couldn’t hear anything, we can usually hear a faint roar when a plane flies over.  So then one of the “lights” starts moving really slowly through the clouds heading east, while the other stayed still.  An actual plane flew by as this was happening, the plane was much faster with blinking lights and we could hear it.  The east light moved for about 5-6 minutes then stopped and hovered.

Strangely, there were no other cars at the light with me, but going east/west and south there were.

570,"Odd trio of orange lights looking north toward LAX on evening of June 12, 2016I'd just left my house to pick up a takeout order from a local restaurant.  It was just before 9 PM local time.  I looked up in the northern sky, which was dark.  Normally I see air traffic on final approach to LAX, which is only a few miles north of my home.  Traffic moves East to West on final approach for normal wind patterns, and hence traffic moves right to left as one looks North to the airport.  Tonight, I observed three bright lights, quite high in the northern sky.  They were irregularly spaced, and quite bright, of roughly the same brightness, in roughly a horizontal line (not precisely), and all were orange in color.  The color was strange to me, given the normal landing light (white) and navigation light (red and green) colors.  Usually, with LAX traffic, one can distinguish individual lights on the planes coming in for final.  These were single points as far as I could tell, and no flashing anti-collision lights.  The trio must have spanned 10 or 15 degrees from my vantage point.  Many times the size of a full moon in terms of angular separation between the leftmost and rightmost lights.  The other thing that seemed odd is that they were moving slowly from left to right - in other words Eastward.  That is very unusual for traffic at LAX.I kept my eyes on them on and off as I drove Eastward myself on Artesia Blvd (and Slausson) to the restaurant.  I pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and just as I was looking for a spot, I noticed that the lights were fading out.  No change in flight path.  Soon afterwards they disappeared entirely.

It appeared to be moving very slowly to the east then stop.  But at the same time there was some clouds coming from the east slowly and stop near the object.  I am assuming the clouds stopped due to the offshore flow coming from the west.  I thought it was too early for Venus or any star to come out with that much light in the sky.  So it seemed awkward for the object to be a star or planet.  At 7:40pm I go inside and comeback out at 7:45pm, the object is still there. I go back inside at 7:49pm then comeback out at 7:51-52pm and it is still there but no other stars or planets in the sky yet.  At 7:55pm, I look up for a few seconds then just as I was going to look away the object took off west and disappeared.  Let me explain “took off,” it was moving and quickly gaining momentum then sped off ultra fast until it literally disappeared.  The only thing I can describe the acceleration looking like is a top fuel dragster launching or a Javelin missile being fired, except 5-10 times faster.

573,"Spherical UFO with rotating light spotted moving south over the Puget Sound and Narrows Bridge.On the evening of June 12, 2016, I was sitting in the living room of my aunt & uncle's house, talking to my cousin.  I was facing a large bay window and through it I saw what I thought was a plane.  It was heading south, towards us, and had 3 blinking lights.  Two on the left (when facing us) and one on the right.  These lights blinked 2 then 1, 2 then 1, left then right, left then right.As it got closer I couldn't make out its shape so I asked my cousin, ""What's that?""  He thought it might be a helicopter.  To check if it was a helicopter I went outside to see if I could hear it.  I could not.By now the craft was overhead and west of us.  It was essentially flying over the Narrows Bridge along the course southward over the Puget Sound.This is when I took out my iPhone and shot about 35 seconds of footage.  It was now 7:42 pm.I stopped filming because some trees would soon obscure my view.  So I went in the backyard to continue watching it.  I asked my uncle what it was.  He didn't know.  I asked if it could be a helicopter, but he said it was too high.  It was definitely very high and flying at a constant velocity on a flat trajectory.I asked my uncle if he had binoculars.  He went inside and grabbed a pair while I continued watching it.  I pointed out the object to my aunt and 8 year-old son, too.  None of us knew what it was.The object continued moving southward and was soon nearly too small to see.  When my uncle returned with the binoculars I was only able to find the object in my sight once before losing it again.  The sun was lowering and bright enough to where I needed to block it with my hand.  It made finding the object at a distance challenging.  The object then became too faint at such a distance and I lost it.The whole event must've lasted approximately 10 or so minutes.

The sky was so clear that night.  We were looking up at the stars.  I then looked straight ahead and saw what I thought was a bright blue star.  It was completely still and shining a bit brighter than the other stars and it was definitely a blue-ish color.  I then pointed it out to my BF.  As soon as I pointed at it (and we were both looking right at it at this point) it moved quickly to the right and changed colors - to a reddish blinking light. It then jerked up, then left, then down, then right.  The turns were very sharp - almost like it stopped in the air and turned right back around to go the other way.

A few minutes later we saw two triangular pla! nes (one after the other) flying parallel to us the turn left toward where the object was.

It definitely could of been coincidental as they turned towards where Logan Airport would be (we see planes fly over all the time in Cambridge).  I know what I saw was something different and no one will convince me otherwise.  It was not a plane, helicopter, drone, laser light, or anything like that.

It appeared to be an orange fire orb, circle in shape with no flashing lights and completely silent unlike a plane.  Best way I can describe was almost like a low pulsing circle flame.  The cloud layer was super thick and a break in the cloud allowed for this low flying fire orb to come through the cloud from the direction of the ocean and head northeast.The fireball flew what appeared to be extremely low, lower then any plane and then appeared to speed up and continue below the clouds for apprx one min and them disappeared off in the distance.  I only say disappeared because the flame went out making the orb no longer visible.Approximately 30 seconds later another fire orb appeared at same altitude but much faster across the sky, them 2 more fire orbs back to back with the same altitude equally spaced apart came across the sky.  All four came from the same direction and had the same exact formation as the previous fire orb, I have never seen anything like that.

Over 50 plus lights of various sizes, or maybe size variance in individual lights created by individual distance from us, created the illusion of different sizes.  They moved very slowly and the whole incident lasted about 5 minutes.  The cluster was very similar to a fireworks burst, only it didn't dissipate.  There was no sign of smokiness as with fireworks.  Each light was distinct and singular and moving in formation over the buildings and trees and then, still moving very slowly, moved straight up into the dark evening clouds.  One of the lights broke formation and traveled downwards very slowly then blinked out.  The cluster was still visible among the evening clouds but barely.  Then eventually faded and disappeared altogether. This is real.  It did happen.  It was very exciting and scary at the same time!

Both aircraft traveled from the southwest to the east, and made it from horizon to horizon in no more than 15 seconds.Each aircraft entered the sky and exited the sky in the same location within 10 minutes of each other.After each sighting, we witnessed heavy air traffic in the vicinity of the exiting location by presumably both human and indentifiable aircraft.  The presence was not threatening, at anything it was welcoming and I  even shouted for the aircraft to take me with it.After witnessing the second aircraft we sat on a nearby swing set to hopefully have 1 more sighting.  Approximately 15 minutes after the 2nd sighting had concluded we witnessed what appeared to be an aircraft that was stationary and astetically identical to a star begin moving from the northwest to the southeast and disappear into the night sky.

600,"White dot/sphere seen by four campers mid-day.So I was up in the Colorado Mountains this weekend, Thursday through Sunday approximately 25 miles southeast of Walden.  Saturday, I was in the camper preparing lunch.  It was about 11:00AM.  My son, a friend of mine, and his son were sitting outside chilling when someone noticed an object way up in the sky behaving oddly.  They were talking about it for a bit when I finally couldn't ignore the conversation anymore.  When I went to check it out, it took me a bit to find but there was a clear object way up. About airplane altitude.  Or at least that is how it appeared.  It was a white dot or ball.  No wings or any other shape was discernible.  It moved across the sky with about the speed of a high altitude airplane or maybe a little faster but made no sound and its movements were definitely not an airplane.  While watching, it did a couple of 360 degree turns and a hair-pin 180 degree turn.  We had no cell reception, so I didn't have my phone handy or I would have filmed it.  I was really wishing I had my binoculars but I didn't pack them.We watched about 10 minutes before we lost sight of it and we never did come up with a good explanation.  A bird could possibly explain the behavior but it was WAY up there and again we couldn't see anything that resembled wings.  We were already at 9500 feet of elevation.  I just don't know if a bird would be that high.  It could have been a weather balloon I suppose.  It looked like that but I'm not so sure about the behavior.  How would a balloon move like that?  The other option could be some military aircraft I suppose.

It was a solid white color.  It was flying fast through the sky then entered a cloud where it vanished for a few seconds when seconds later I see something similar exit almost the exact stop where it entered.  But this time it had two lights on each wing with a flashing red light in the center. when I noticed that was a plane and the other object finally exists the other side of the cloud.  Realizing they were both flying at about 35k ft,but the white object was much quicker and I watched it   travel across the rest of the sky untill the end of the horizon while passing several other planes, with one looking to be in pursuit but who knows at the time their was an unusual amount of air traffic.  All the planes exhibited the same features with the same two lights on each wing and re! d flashing in the middle.  It was clear at this point it was not a plane.  Too low to be a satellite or space dandruff or ice falling it flew across the sky never loosing elevation.  This most likely rules out drones flares or anything man made.  I also saw a meteor fall from the sky half hour after this and it was completely different.  I've seen alot of orbs and flying objects, since I look for them after a terrifying sighting which left me a believer yet still skeptical of just anything I rule out all possibility and do research to back up my claim.

I was outside in my side yard looking West when from my left (South) I observed what appeared to be a fireball entering from high in the South.  It traveled North North West.  It was approximately 3 times brighter than Jupiter (which was up) and very bright white yellow orange and had a slight tail pointing South.  I instantly thought fireball, but the object was slowing down, so I instantly thought this object was space junk.  This object was ""dropping"" what appeared to be hot material that was same color as the object.  The object continued to slow down and dripped the strange material two times on its trajectory before the object slowed to a complete static stop.  I was baffled to say the least.  As the object remained stationary, it dripped the bright material momentarily.  The flight time from when I saw the object to when it came to a complete static stop was approximately 10 seconds - which is far too long of a time for any fireball or space junk, which I've witnessed countless times.  I observed this object stationary for approximately 2 minutes in absolute amazement.  I had my iPhone in my hand and shot one still photo of the object prior to it coming to a complete stop and I shot video as well.

630,"Silver-white cigar shaped object(s) floating above the Grand Strand.My mother and I were leaving our house in Little River, SC, upon leaving the neighborhood I saw 2 whitish-silver cigar shaped crafts, one appeared to be smaller than the other.  the larger one appeared to not be moving and the smaller of the two did move, it seemed to be slow moving.  They were spotted in the South West sky.  (not over the ocean like the infamous ""Orange lights"" I have previously seen.)

At first my mother did not see them until I handed her my sunglasses.We lost sight of them as we traveled south east, we ended up in North Myrtle Beach to run errands and I spotted them again. NMB is approx 10 miles from my house and the first place I spotted the crafts. When I spotted them this time they appeared to be slow moving in two different directions.The third time I saw them today I was down in Myrtle Beach approx 29 miles from my front door.I called my father in little river, told him the direction (SW) to look and he was able to see the larger of the crafts from where he was.  This tells me whatever this was, was high enough in the sky and big enough to be seen from where I was in Myrtle, to where my father was in Little River.If this were a craft, military or otherwise 1.) you could see it clearly without polarized glasses. 2.) it would not have appeared in the exact same place in the sky over the course of three+ hours. 3.)

We were outside of a ride waiting in line when I looked up at the sky to see the stars.  I saw what appeared to be a satellite.  It was headed south/southwest and was a reddish orange color.

At this point my friend looked away and the object stopped a second time.  It turned from a reddish-orange to yellow and let out a sky blue beam out into the night sky on its left side and disappeared into the clouds.I cannot believe that my friend looked down at his phone just before it started to act like it was not a satellite but maybe other people saw it too.

We are away from the bright lights of any city, and we often stargaze on clear nights.  This morning, while looking towards the northwest sky, we both noticed a bright and shining light that seemed to (at first) be pulsating...we have an app called sky guide that shows us where objects are in the night sky, and this was not an object identified on any of our apps.  As we continued to watch, the light appeared to be moving in various formations, and actually seemed to split off and away from another similar entity before returning back to the object (or beside it maybe)....it hovered and zoomed about as if it was teleporting to the side/to and fro from the central origin point and appeared to be at least 2...probably 3 in formation moving in unison.  What was most amazing was the rotation of colors that presented!  We are typically used to seeing the GPS aircra! ft above us (they have red, white, and blue blinking lights) that are VERY common, especially in the past few years.  To a novice viewer, these GPS craft can very easily seem exotic.  This was NOT any type of craft or sky object that either of us had ever seen before-in fact, I couldn't stop staring in amazement as each second seemed more and more unbelievable.  Right above the distant silhouette of the tree line, this ""light"" actually transformed  itself from a glow similar to that of a bright white star to greenish blue to red (in rapid succession) and then eventually back to white while hovering, glowing brighter (similar to watching the backside of thrusters being engaged) then fading and appearing to finally move away and quickly increase altitude until it was GONE!  Afterwards, I studied the placement of the stars, etc, Mercury was at the same height of the entity but directly southwest vs northwest where the light had been.

666,"Roundish shaped object about size of basketball, bright white on front, flames out back on multi-second descent from sky.My wife called me at work to report seeing an object descending from sky in a rainbow-like arc.

667,"Spindle-shaped object with no wings, no sound, no vapor trail seen in clear sky in daylight.On Monday, 6 June, 2016, from approximately 10:30 to 10:35 a.m., under a clear blue sky, with sun shining and no obvious haze, I witnessed a strange silvery-gray aircraft(?) fly over my property.  I stood in my garden and watched it for what I would guess was just under 5 minutes as it seemed to glide or “slip” through the sky.  (I did not have a watch on, but looked at the time when I went back into the house a few minutes later)  The craft was long and thin, rather spindly, than cigar-shaped, with tapered ends, and it appeared to have no wings or means of propulsion.  I did notice what looked like a shadowy line or slightly darker area running vertically about two-thirds of the way back from the leading end or front of the craft.  Other than that (and I should stress that that mark was truly nothing more than a shadow-like area—not a clearly defined stripe or change of color from the rest of the craft--almost more a “suggestion” of a stripe) there were no marks, visible protuberances of any kind, lights, color or decoration anywhere on the object. It was simply long, smooth, and silver.  I watched it as it came into view from the southeast—keeping it in sight until it disappeared into the northwest—but I never heard a sound (not even the suggestion of sound) or noticed the slightest change of shape to indicate that previously unseen wings or other parts may have been hidden by the angle of flight.The craft appeared to be at a relatively high altitude—extending my arm fully and pointing it at the craft, I could almost cover it with one finger but it was not quite as long as two finger widths.  (Maybe an inch long at arm’s length when pointing to what would be about an 11 o’clock position in the sky, if the horizon was at 9 o’clock, and noon was straight overhead.)  I saw it coming towards me, as it went past, and then as it went away from me, but nothing in the way of wings or anything else ever showed—even in suggestion.  It was 100% smooth.  However, I don’t want to mislead anyone.  I was never presented with an absolute end-on or front-end view that might have allowed me to see it in cross-section.  My observations were strictly from below and to one side, although the fact that the length of the spindle grew longer, then shorter, as I watched its progress, shows that I did see at least a slight three-quarter view as it followed its path across the sky.There were two rather interesting and puzzling things about this object that I find hard to describe (other than its being soundless, wingless, featureless and having no vapor trail at all, I mean) ...The first is that it seemed to have a kind of very faint luminosity about it that did not seem to be the result of light reflection.  It somehow managed to look as if it were both a dull silver-gray AND lit up from the inside at the same time.  Sort of like a faintly charged glow-in-the-dark object but with a clearer, colorless light.  I imagine it might be what you’d see if you put a light source behind a mylar sheet, but there was no focal point of brighter light.  It was diffuse and very faint, as if the light came from the object’s surface, rather than interior.The second thing is that the entire object or craft appeared to have a kind of halo or aura in a perfect circle around it a fair distance from it.  The aura was something like the corona you see around a full moon under certain conditions except that it was dark rather than light and so faint as to be nearly invisible.  I actually thought my eyes were playing tricks on me,, at first, and that I wasn’t really seeing anything but those annoying “floaters” people sometimes get.  I tried rubbing my eyes and even looking at other parts of the sky to see if the phenomena was in my own eyes, but I could not see it except while looking at the craft. After ascertaining that there really was something there, I began to wonder if it was some sort of rotary device—like helicopter blades—spinning so fast that it was nearly invisible, but I think I would have heard something like that, especially when I started thinking about how enormous it would have to be.  If the craft was approximately an inch across at arm’s length, the circle around it would have been more like two inches across by the same measure—much too large for a rotor, I would think.  And of course, it floated completely independent of the craft.  There were no connections between that circle of faint darkness and the craft itself.I wish I could describe this better, but despite being on many an Air Force base and at airports around the world in my day, I’ve really not come across anything quite like this before. Let me correct that …  This marks the fourth time I have seen this craft over the last several years.  (I cannot recall the exact dates, unfortunately, but I would say that I first saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and have seen it twice more between this sighting and that first.) In each case, except the third occurrence, the sightings were on clear, sunny days in late spring or early summer and each time the flight path appeared to be either east or southeast to west or northwest.I live in a very rural area near a national forest and have goats. In both of the first two incidents I was out with my goats and got a very good look at it.  The third occurrence was less distinct because I was preoccupied with something too important to stop doing and I only got a chance to glance at it a bit in between.  However, I do remember that it was also a fine day, though I do not remember what time of year it was or which direction the craft was traveling.You will wonder why I am reporting this now when I did not report it before.  I can only say that because I have a rational mind I have spent the intervening years trying to convince myself that what I saw was nothing more than an unusual aircraft of unfamiliar design.  I was helped in this by my husband who has always maintained that I did not see wings because the angle was wrong or light got in my eyes, or something …  He explained away the lack of sound by saying other sounds may have disguised it; it was not traveling in a direction that allowed me to hear the sound right away; or I simply mis-remembered it.  The same for all my other objections.  I began to be half-convinced that I was simply mis-remembering everything … until today.I watched this thing for long enough to be judge and jury today.  I questioned myself on every point and  acquitted myself of insanity and faulty memory on every score AS I WATCHED IT.  ""Does it have wings?,"" I asked.  NO.  Does it have a vapor trail?  NO. Does it emit any sound?  NO.  And so on.  It is as described.  What that is,  I leave you to decide.I will email a simple drawing of the object following this submission.",Duration:~5 minutes,"Location: Cedarcreek, MO",Occurred : 6/6/2016 10:30  (Entered as : 06/06/2016 10:30),Posted: 6/10/2016,Reported: 6/6/2016 11:26:19 AM 11:26,Shape: Cigar

679,"Multiple continuously-luminous craft, flying silently at very high speed, with irregular greenish flashes.This sighting was made during the ""Contact in the Desert"" event, held 3-6 June 2016 at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center (JTRC) in Joshua Tree, CA.  Spanning an approximately 10-minute period beginning at about 10:30 PM, we (my wife and I) observed a total of seven (7) continuously-luminous flying objects approached JTRC at very high speed over the Western horizon (direction of Yucca Valley).  The objects arrived singly, one after the other, and in pairs at irregular intervals over the approximate 10-minute observation period.  None of the objects exhibited standard red, green or white blinking aircraft navigation lights.  Each object flew exceedingly smoothly, silently and rapidly towards the East and then each turned smoothly toward the North/Northeast when they arrived directly North of the JTRC grounds. The distance to the flying craft was estimated to be less than two miles, but could have been as little as one mile away at their closest approach to t! he JTRC.  Throughout their approach from the West and eventual disappearance to the North, the objects emitted a continuous pale bluish/green to soft amber light.  The craft were sufficiently bright and large to be very easily observed without the assistance of night-vision optics or binoculars.  At irregular intervals during their flight trajectories, each craft displayed bright flashes of an iridescent green glow.  The glowing flashes did not appear to emanate from a fixed point on the craft, but rather seemed to be diffuse in nature and sweep over the craft in an uneven manner.  The flash duration was about 1 second or less.  As mentioned above, the craft were fairly close (estimated 1-2 miles) and when the green flashes occurred, it was just possible to make out some kind of hull structure to the craft, i.e., the craft did not appear as sharp points of light or amorphous balls of light.  When the craft were targeted by one or more hand-held lasers, they sometimes flashed green.  But they also flashed a green glow at times when they were n! ot illum inated by lasers.  From its first appearance on the western horizon, each object took about 30 seconds (or possibly less) to complete its west-to-east flyby past the JTRC, perform the sweeping northerly turn, and subsequently gradually disappear over the northern horizon.  The estimated distance of the objects when they first appeared over the western horizon was 5 miles.  Similarly, the estimated distance to the point of disappearance in the north was also 5 miles, resulting in a total (visible) flight trajectory of 10 miles.  Assuming this distance was traveled in 30 seconds or less, the minimum speed of the objects may be estimated at about 1200 miles per hour.  Importantly, no sound of any kind was detected as the objects flew past, which would be consistent with an unconventional (i.e., non-jet engine) type of propulsion system.",Duration:~10 minutes,"Location: Joshua Tree, CA",Occurred : 6/4/2016 22:30  (Entered as : 4 June 201 22:30),Posted: 6/10/2016,Reported: 6/9/2016 4:12:38 PM 16:12,Shape: Oval

682,"100 plus ppl have sighting at Contact in the Desert Conference of 10 very fast muliple colored objects.I will attempt to be succinct in order to keep this report brief.  Please call me for additional details.  I am the Owner of UFO Sighting Tours in Sedona, AZ.  I have completed 588 tours with the use of PVS 7, Gen. 3 Military Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  I was hired by the CITD conference to run their Night Vision Events at this year’s 2016 conference running June 2 thru 6, 2016.  The previous 4 listed reports on this site from Joshua Tree, CA, were from attendees of the Saturday, June 4th event that I led.  I know many additional people that were in attendance who may be contacted for reports/interviews and I may provide phone numbers.  I am a trained observer and a past MUFON investigator.  I was a past member of the Board for MUFON OC, CA.On June 4th well over 100 people were gathered at Orion’s point lookout, a location at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center.  At approx. 10:00 or just prior, most of the attendees witnessed what I am about to describe.  There were 18 pairs of NVGs provided, as well as many individuals privately owned goggles present.  Yet the following were clearly visible with the naked unaided eye and were seen by most present without equipment.  The following sightings lasted approx. 20 minutes total time.  I was busy leading the group and instructing them on a PA system and did not note the time, but many of those present informed me after the fact.  Videos of this event are surfacing and are being gathered.  A professional documentary film crew was present on behalf of CITD and achieved footage of these sightings, but I have not seen it.  I will provide it as soon as it is available.As I witnessed it:  Approaching from the west and flying east across the valley in front of us, and coming low over a hill, were the following large colored lights flying extremely fast.  First to appear was a blue light, then shortly thereafter a red or amber light, and then 2 bright green ones.  After a brief pause of a few minutes came 2 more green ones followed by a single green one, again, flying over the hill at an extremely rapid speed.  This second grouping then slowed way down and came together to form a distinct triangle formation and continued to fly across the valley maintaining this formation traveling all the way in a very slow even pace.  Eventually this formation disappeared from vision right in front of us.  I was not holding NVGs at the time, but those that were said this triangle formation was seen speeding up and shooting up off into space.  Many said that somewhere in this mix was a purple light, but I did not see that.  This was a total thus far of abou! t 7 clearly visible craft.People were yelling out, applauding and very excited during these events.  After a about 5 minutes had passed, Jimmy Church, popular radio talk show host and his wife Rita approached me.  A friend of theirs’s had called them on her cell and told them to come quick!  I informed them they just missed some remarkable sightings.  When suddenly in comes yet another large green light from over the same hill to the west.  And shortly after even another green light.  They witnessed these 2 green lights (naked eye) along with other objects that they saw using the NVGs over the next 10 mins.  Soon after those 2 green ones, a very large amber light came right over us all and very quickly disappeared right above us.  Including this amber one, the total crafts sighted in about 20 minutes was well over 10.  All 10 major sightings were way, way, way too fast to be satellites, completely silent, went from hauling in to slowing down to a snail’s pace immediately, and then completely disappea! red before us.  All of which are things military jets and satellites CAN NOT DO!  We started viewing that night at 8:30 p.m. and didn’t stop till 11:30 p.m. and continued to have sightings on and off the whole while.  I educate everyone on all the various type of planes, shooting stars, and all about satellites in order to be able to rule those out.  Then and only then are we left with unknown or unidentified objects.  All these sightings were clearly unidentified! Also in use were multiple high powered green lasers.  I had brought eight 5-mile, two 10-mile, and one 100-mile visible length of beam lasers and they were distributed throughout the crowd and some people had brought their own.  As these 10 total objects over about 20 minutes were witnessed many people were hitting them with the lasers.  We use the lasers both for pointing out objects and for flashing at them to get possible UFOs to flash back.  This has proven successful on most of my tours.  As these 10 objects were hit by lasers, myself and others realized that while some may have been flashing back in response, that most likely our lasers were hitting actual metallic surfaces and reflecting off of the objects!  Many of the people standing near me, including Jimmy Church, thought this is what we were actually seeing.  This would also mean that these objects were extremely close.The response from the crowd had been overwhelming.  Many people have expressed that this was a paradigm changing event for them.  I’m spoiled.  I get to see real sightings on all my tours.  But this night, same as those, I loved providing that experience for others.  I never get tired of people’s reactions.  For me, it’s always confirmation that UFOs are real and seeing them is truly believing.((NUFORC Note:  We would like to convey our gratitude to Melinda Leslie, a UFO researcher, and one of the speakers at the Contact in the Desert 2016 Conference, for sharing the information in this report.

They were first seen rising over the top of the house myself and the other observers were gathered at.  We were all positioned in the backyard, looking to the south.  One person pointed them out, then everyone watched for what was ultimately about 20 minutes.  The objects appeared to be completely black, though the large one had what looked to be lighting of some kind on one side, but it was difficult to say definitively, as they were quite a distance away when this was noticed by one observer.  Nobody filmed them, though I don't know if it would have mattered anyway - on footage they would have just looked like black specs.  The movements of the craft were strange.  They didn't float away like a balloon, but rather they appeared to rise in a slow, deliberate manner, in a fixed direction to the south, with their distance increasing simultaneously with their height.  There was no sound associated with the craft that we noticed.  At first there were two smaller objects, one positioned somewhat close below, and the other just below the that.  The third, lowest of the three, seemed to move off to the East, and was quickly lost sight of.  The other two, however, remained in view of myself and the other witness for quite some time.  The craft stayed the same distance from each other for the duration of their movements, and never seemed to deviate.  Eventually the objects rose so high that it was not possible to see them anymore, and everyone went back to what they were doing.

699,"small bright white lights apppear in a starry skyIt was about 1:25 a.m. Saturday, June 4, 2016, (this morning).  I ventured outside with my husky following a thunderstorm.  The night sky was filled with stars!  To the south, a town or two away, was lightening in the distant clouds, but no streaks of lightning; no jagged lines or ground contact--just electricity lighting up that section of clouds.Looking in that direction and a bit to the east, in a southerly neighbor’s yard, suddenly a flash of light appeared by the tree top.  Perfectly round, small, bright.At first, I thought it was a firefly, yet it didn’t zigzag like a firefly; it merely blinked for a moment.  Then a second one directly next to it appeared to the right.  The two lights shone simultaneously about a yard apart, in a straight line, then disappeared.I turned and walked a few feet to the west, admiring the planets, and constellations.  Such a clear sky! A couple of planets, and so many stars!  I had a clear view of the big dipper.Within seconds of facing due west, the big dipper to my right and a bit north, a small, round, bright white light appeared much higher in the atmosphere.  It was identical in size and brightness to the first two and seemed to appear from behind a different neighbor’s tree, moving north along the sky, much higher in the atmosphere, silently;.This light appeared like a twinkling star,as did the first two, then disappeared.  Yet it reappeared much further along its straight-lined path to the north, much higher in the Earth's atmosphere.  The light intermittently blinked it’s way across the sky rapidly moving northerly then disappeared out of sight in the northern sky.There were no sounds for any of the lights; no plane noises nearby.  None of the lights moved as comets would, or planes, or fireflies.The experience felt soothing, magical, and precious.",Duration:1 minute,"Location: Manhattan, KS",Occurred : 6/4/2016 01:25  (Entered as : 060416 1:25),Posted: 6/10/2016,Reported: 6/4/2016 12:55:21 AM 00:55,Shape: Light

The Airplane and UFO were in the same vicinity for about 15 seconds…it almost seemed like the Sharks Tooth was following the aircraft.  So the plane was approx. 2-3000 ft and climbing, whilst the Triangle was maybe 2-300 feet below the Airplane.  The Sharks Tooth suddenly accelerated and as the Twin Propeller airplane was climbing slowly, the Dark Red Triangle went from my 5 o’clock (counterclockwise) to my 10 o’clock in about 5 seconds and just disappeared into the early summer night.  And just like that it was gone, but that plane was still climbing, it was kind of funny.  So the craft was a triangle shape, but with long-sides ( k! inda like a sharks tooth).

When I headed into the Harrington shopping center, I happened to glance up and see something odd.The object had pulsating blue, red, and yellow lights.  It was tumbling upward.  Not flying straight like an airplane or hovering like helicopter or drone.  It was tumbling in a way I’d never seen anything move before.I took a picture and a close up of it looks almost like a drone, but a later screen grab from my video has it looking like an orb with a light flashing on the side.  I don’t know what it is, and it really frightened me, so I wanted answers.I shared the video with friends and family.  Some say it was a drone.  The thing is, when I examined the video, there is a part where whatever it was “glitched” and it suddenly was somewhere else.  I didn’t see this with my naked eye at the time, only upon viewing the video.  I’ve never seen a drone move that fast.  Unless there was a problem with my phone during filming.  Anyway, this thing was tumbling and then it suddenly reversed until it was right over me.At that point, I stopped filming because I was startled.I live in a few miles an air base.  That does nothing to answer my questions because as I said, it looked like NOTHING I’d ever seen before.  Whether a civilian or military craft – and I see a lot of both on the regular.

Upon exiting my vehicle in front of my apartment, I looked up at the sky to admire the stars as it was a fairly clear night.  Fallon has a fair amount of light pollution making it difficult to see a lot of stars.  I looked at a patch of clouds in the eastern sky and observed a pale glow reflecting off of the clouds and some type of aircraft coming through the patch, heading toward the west.  It was flying in a straight path at a relatively fast pace, but not unlike a jet airplane flying at a low altitude.  It appeared to be small and triangular, blackish in color, with a pale light on each point.  But its size is relative to its altitude so I am not completely sure how small or large it was.  It may have been flying at 5-10,000 feet relative to the eastern patch of clouds.  I noticed how it covered the stars as it passed ! above, which made it easy to track its  flight path in the sky.  I only observed the craft for approximately two minutes or less and it was out of my line of sight quickly.  I was standing 20 feet from my one-story apartment door which impaired my sight to the west.

A moment later, we heard knocking at the door. I knew it was my brother and assumed he forgot his phone or wallet and needed to get it before leaving.When I opened the door, my brother asked me to come out and see something strange.  When I walked outside he pointed to two orange lights just above the tree line towards the Northeast.  I immediately dismissed the lights as aircraft.  He corrected me and said they were moving unlike normal aircraft.  He described the objects having moved parallel to each other before rotating and changing direction.  Again, I dismissed him as I only saw two orange lights.  One was stationary and the other was moving similarly to an airplane. He asked me to note the orange nature of the objects and compare them to the light blue stars and the light blue lights of another obvious aircraft behind us.After the comparison, I did admit to the variation in light but simply dismissed the one moving object as an airplane.  The other object I assumed was a planet due to its stationary position and orange glow.By this time, the moving object had disappeared behind the tree line while the stationary object remained in view.  My brother attempted to explain the strange nature of the object's movements when, suddenly, the stationary orange dot began to move.  This startled me.  I watched with astonishment as the object moved along the sky and was temporarily obscured by the tree line before coming back into view.

There were no clouds from horizon to horizon in any given direction.  The temperature was in the low nineties.  I was in a patrol vehicle at my place of employment traveling in a northern direction and drifting slightly east.  To the north west of my locating about a half a mile away there are some small peaks that are maybe a thousand feet higher in elevation than my location.   These peaks are strung out east to west.I glance at the peaks and saw a round dark shadow that followed the surface contour of the landscape moping from east to west.  I only saw it for a couple of seconds before it passed the most western peak.What was strange about it was that the sun at that time in the morning is almost straight up and the peaks are very close to my location.  I immediately stopped (less than five seconds) and got out of the vehicle looking for an object that may have caused the round shadow, but there was nothing to be seen anywhere in the sky in my general location. There was nothing between the sun and those peaks.  There was nothing moving out of the area heading west as far as the eye could see.  Many miles to the west (about twenty miles) I could see Sky Harbor International traffic along the I-17 corridor flying from north to south, but those shadows would be cast further to the west.  I had seen shadows before across those peaks caused by aircraft but they moved slower and had the definite shape of an aircraft.  This was round and moving very fast.

It initially appeared to be moving slightly downward and was thought to be just that, a meteorite.  It then appeared to level out ever so slightly, still at very high altitude.  It had a Southern heading.  As it was tracked visually, its abnormal shape became more apparent.  The chevron-like outline was the only part that appeared to glow (now a white/blue) and thus was clearly visible, but the interior portion, while difficult to make out, was definitely opaque (making the object a triangle rather than just a chevron).  Just before the object left line of sight, it abruptly and instantly changed direction and increased speed, heading East, toward the Atlantic coastline.  There was no trail, haze, or sound throughout the duration of this sighting.As a military veteran, I initially suspected some sort of stealth craft upon recognizing the unnatural shape, but nothing in the United States military arsenal (that is known publicly or that I've seen during my time in service) can travel that fast or instantly change direction at such speeds.This was my first unidentified flying object sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

818,"Light orange/white/yellow 'Fireball' sighting in Milliken, CO.At 2352 hrs. on Friday 28 May, 2016, my friend and myself were traveling southbound on Highway 257 towards the town of Milliken.  The terrain drops in elevation as you approach the town, which affords a wide view of the horizon.As we turned the slight bend during the elevation drop, we both immediately noticed a bright light orange/white burst of light approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  I initially thought the object was a commercial aircraft making a maneuver towards Denver International Airport, as this location is in the flight path of the airport.After the initial burst of light, the ‘fireball’ appeared to dim slightly while changing to a yellow color.  At this point the object began to descend and hover lower above the horizon. It then moved in the sky irregularly up and down before regaining a higher altitude.  During the entire sighting the light pattern flickered at an irregular rate with varying intensity.  After approximately sixty seconds, the object was out of our line of sight and appeared to disappear from its original sighting location.This sighting seems to be similar to the other ‘fireball’ sightings occurring over the last four years as regularly reported by NUFORC.",Duration:1 minute,"Location: Milliken, CO",Occurred : 5/27/2016 23:52  (Entered as : 05/27/16 23:52),Posted: 6/1/2016,Reported: 5/28/2016 10:33:24 AM 10:33,Shape: Fireball
819,"Large, discus shaped object, silently hovering 60-70 ft AGL in front of my home.  Surface smooth, & glowing orange-white.I came out to close my garage door when I noticed an orange-white glow directly across the street from my house.  I stepped to the garage doorway and saw a discus-shaped object silently hovering about 60-70 feet AGL.  The object was approx 60 feet in diameter, and 20-25 feet thick from top to bottom, and the body occulted the star field and sky behind it.  The distance to where the object was hovering from my house was approx. 150 feet.  The front door of my house faces south (180 deg.).The glow was not very bright, and appeared to be radiating from the surface of the object.  There were NO other anti-collision or navigation type lights as required by the FAA.  The overall surface texture appeared to be smooth with no observable windows or excrescences, such as antennas, air intakes or engine cowlings.I immediately walked into the house to get a cell phone to shoot video.  I told my girlfriend about the object, as I went to the front door of the house.  The garage and front door are side by side.  I stepped through the door and re-acquired visual on the object, which had not moved.  As I lifted the phone to begin video, the object silently accelerated away to the SW, disappearing in 1.5 seconds.  There was no engine sound or rotor sounds such as a helicopter would make.My longest time observing the object was in the garage, which lasted for 20-25 seconds.  In that time I went through the momentary shock of seeing an object of this size, shape, and lack of engine noise hovering just above the power lines.  Once I grasped what I was observing, I began to look at the details and structure of the object.I have been around aircraft and aviation since I was a child, and can recognize almost any modern aircraft, including kit planes, helicopters, military aircraft (including RPV's), and commercial jetliners.  I have 2,700 hours time piloting single-engine aircraft with an instrument (IFR) rating.  In my entire experience, I have NEVER observed an aircraft this shape, size, or configuration.  And I have NEVER observed an aircraft silently accelerate from ZERO to what had to be multiple Mach speed and leave no sonic footprint.There were no other aircraft nearby, overhead, or with the object.  The nearest airport is KPGD ( Punta Gorda ) approx. 12 miles away to the SE.  Conditions were CAVU (ceiling and visibility unlimited), with a clear star field.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very sober-minded.

823,"Blue to bright red spherical light over Selfridge Airforce Base; landed.On the night of 5/27/16, between the times of 11:05 and 11:11 pm, my co-worker called me out of the home we work at to point out a weird object flying in the sky that was traveling from the west, headed east, and finally came to rest positioned somewhere over or near Selfridge Air Force base.  When the object first appeared it was very blue and very brightly illuminated, the lights weren't flickering or dimming like in typical aircraft.  This was not like any star or planet I have ever seen in the sky before.  The object was slightly bigger in appearance than the North Star, and emitted no sounds, and moved very smoothly, until it came to a complete stop northeast of where we were looking and positioned.  When the object came to a stop about 3 to 4 smaller orb like blue lights came out of the bottom of the object and hovered there for about 1 minute, before the orbs disappeared back into the object and the object turned solid bright vibrant red.  The object remained still in the sky for about another 2 minutes, and then started to lower itself to the ground.  It continued to descend to the ground while remaining bright solid red, until it disappeared out of our visual field.  The whole time the object remained the same size and the lights were always visible to my coworker and me.  This event lasted a total of 6 minutes.The house we are located at is in Eastpointe, Michigan, at 9 Mile Rd., just west of Hayes.  The object was viewed moving just north of us, probably about 8-10 miles away, towards the Harrison Township/Mount Clemens area.  This is the approximate location that Selfridge Air Force Base is situated compared to where we are.  The weather is clear and cloud cover is almost none.  It is not raining and there are hardly any stars visible, so this object really stuck out.  I am not sure the altitude of the object but I do know that while my co-worker and I were viewing this event, the object was positioned between two telephone poles, and was about 3 feet above the wire that crosses between the poles.  My best guess would be that this object was flying at the elevation of about 20,000 feet to 25,000 feet in the air.  It wasn't as high as a plane would normally be seen flying.My co-worker attempted to get video footage while this whole thing was happening.  We don't know if the video came out, or is clear, because it was taken on his smart phone, and the screen is small and marred from overuse.  I am working on transferring the video from his phone to my computer to see it we can upload it to get a better look to see if we were able to catch is even on film.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.

I came across at least three or four photos where the object seperates and clearly can see two objects.  Also in the photos pick up the object with a purple light.  And in other photos a blue light.  And in others a light blue with green which is very puzzling.  One other thing to mention is normally a light or object is picked up much easier on my phone while recording video opposed to shooting a picture.

Heading north on Hwy 1, approaching Lake Grassmere at about 19:45, I noticed a very bright light in the night sky over the range of hills just north of the lake.  The light seemed to be farther out behind the hills, likely over the Cook Strait.

When I observed the lights in the north western sky, I noticed they were well above the tree line in the distance, yet very bright.  I saw the lights for about 5 seconds, then called for my husband to look out the front of our house.  I watched the lights for about another 3-5 seconds then moved to my husband’s location about 25 feet from my observation point. The lights were gone by the time I arrived at my husbands’ location.When I saw my husband I said that couldn’t have been a plane, and my husband immediately said that was no plane.  We agreed if it had been a plane as large as what we observed, we would have heard engine noise or something as it passed.  We noted the stillness of the moment, very quiet outside.   We continued to watch the night sky for a minute or two before going inside.   We determined what we saw was not from spot lights projecting in the air or any plane, helicopter or luminaries.My husband has a private pilot’s license, has law enforcement experience, and I am a retired law enforcement Deputy with almost 36 years of service.  My husband and I are familiar with helicopters’ and airplanes; we are night sky watchers and look for the satellites going through the sky.

858,"Unbelievable noise, perfect triangular formation of lights, on a dark overcast night.On 05/24/16 at 2:04AM, I was wide awake reading the news of the day on my cell phone, when suddenly I proceeded to hear an oncoming sound that was rapidly increasing in volume.  This noise was so distinct that I could make out the direction of travel from inside my home.  The increase in volume became extreme in a matter of seconds to where I was expecting to see lights before actual impact.  The reason I say lights is because I live very high up on a hill and the only thing that could be that high would have to be an aircraft.   The problem was that the unbelievably intense sound that I heard was that of what a semi truck would make when it gears down, not that of an aircraft.The moment I was sure of impending impact, everything became silent.  My first reaction was ""a commercial plane just buzzed my house and it was way too close.""  I was mad enough to where I looked out my large window into the overcast darkness to get a visual of this ""plane.""  What I saw was a large white light appearing in my window while slowly moving until it disappeared from view due to the window frame.  All of a sudden I see a second large white light now appearing in my window where the previous light had been  before it moved out of my sight.  I  thought that it must of been two planes that buzzed my house and made the noise I heard.  I got up and walked to the window to get a look at the source of my anger when I realized that not only was there two white lights, but a large steady red light that had been out of sight because of my window.These three lights made an absolute perfect triangular shape in the sky.  So precise was the formation that I was searching to see the body of what was holding these lights in such perfect form.  I could see nothing except these three lights.  There was no solid body, blinking lights, noise, straying out of the formation, nothing.  I stood in awe due to the perfection of the formation as it slowly started to disappear heading North over the tree line.  I did not leave the window but watched until all I could see were the trees.I had to have some kind of affirmation that I was not alone in what had just happened, so I called 911 asking if anyone had called in due to hearing an unbelievably loud noise.  I knew there was no possibility a person could of not heard what I had.  The operator told me that there had been no reports of such a noise and then asked me what had happened.  After I explained what I had experienced, she gave me the phone number of the Washington State UFO Center and also the Air Force Base located outside Seattle, WA.  I then called my husband who had been at work and told him what had happened.The next day I called the UFO Center and was instructed to document my experience.  Since I did not have internet access up and running yet, I told the UFO Center that I would as soon as I am able.  I also proceeded to call the Air Force, wanting to see if they had a report of anything  unusual.  I was told someone would look into it and get back to me.  A day later I received a call informing me that the Base had 3 Black Hawk Helicopters flying over my area on the same day around the same time frame of my experience.

They weren't flashing, but I immediately assumed it was an airplane or a jet from Hill Air Force Base, until I processed how incredibly large of a plane it would have to be and that it wasn't moving at all.

I thought to myself, ""What’s Cassiopeia doing there, and the Big Dipper, too low in the sky and in the wrong direction.""  I pulled my car over and got out, and saw that the lights were slowly moving from west to east. Seeing them in motion was quite a shock. Not planes, not helicopters, just steady bright white lights floating slowly to the north of where I was, from west to east.  I ran back to the house and told everyone to come out to see what was happening.  The 15 or so still there came outside onto the driveway and sidewalk to watch the show.  The lights seemed to be drifting, slightly changing position in relation with one another.  They seemed to be slowly ascending as they moved east they neared the posi! tion of the full Moon, which had risen about an hour or two earlier.  They gradually faded from sight.  A retired policeman was among the witnesses.  Our guess on the most mundane side was that they could have been balloons with attached lights, launched from Ocean/Mission/or Pacific Beach and were riding the nightly onshore breeze which was taking them to the east, directly over Mission Bay then Mission Valley to our north.  I later went to Ocean Beach and asked fishermen on the north side of the pier if they had see balloons launched from the long stretch of these three above beaches to the north, but none had seen anything.

889,"Multiple UFO Sighting - Murfreesboro.	On 05-21-15 at 2050 hours, I observed multiple orange circular objects in the atmosphere traveling at high rate of speed, and what I judged to be 1000 feet or slightly more in elevation.  The objects grabbed my attention because they appeared to be on fire, until I observed several more, consistently coming from the Northeast part of the sky, and flying over to the Southeast part of the sky crossing the full moon before dimming out.  I observed these objects from a residential area on the West side of Murfreesboro, TN, with one other witness.  In addition, I could hear multiple other people in the area making noises every time the objects would fly over.  I could not see those individuals, and did not make contact with them.  The objects flew in a line formation, and then transitioned into a close triangle formation.  They gained altitude extremely fast, which I was unable to judge the speed, and they slowed down at times to a near stop in the middle of the air after traveling extremely fast.  Over a period of forty five minutes to an hour I observed twenty or more of these objects flying over the clear night sky.  There was no sound, no visible beacon light, no visible wings, and no observed aircraft spotlight.  The entire object was a bright orange, and no matter which direction it went it remained as such.  There were two aircraft seen in the same area during the event one flying at or around the same altitude, and was clearly heard and known to be a plane with definable wings I could see with the moonlight, and beacon lights.  The other was harder to hear and was flying what appeared to be higher than 30,000 feet, and I could see its beacon’s flashing.  Neither of the two planes was flying in the manner in which the twenty or so objects were.  Originally, I suspected they were meteorites or asteroids because they appeared on fire.  However, they slowed down changed formation dimmed out and then got brighter.  They appeared to be in a controlled flight pattern.

I have been using meditative techniques I learned from Dr. Steven Greer's CE5 initiative and applied it to my own practice.  I've been witnessing many orb like UFO sightings during these meditations and have been able to document lots of high strangeness.  There are far too many experiences and incidents to paint the clearest picture of what is happening in just one report, which is why I felt confused about how to report such a long timeline of events.  Despite all these antidotal words, I have documented what I could via my YouTube channel.  It's very basic, no music, no graphics, and all short and to the point.  It's hard to pick out the best video, but I am posting 2 links here, with the first video being the date and time linked to this report.  As I said, my channel is quite simple and you're more than welcomed to see the rest of my videos at your leisure to help understand how frequent it is.  Most sightings, including the one from this report are from my high rise apartment looking out toward midtown Manhattan.

To my left there was a narrow strip of tree lined pasture where cattle graze.  Rising above the trees was a oval shaped green orb that was about 10-15 ft. wide.  At the bottom of the orb was a small red light.  The orb was moving back and forth over the trees.  Since I was the only one traveling on that stretch of the road, I dropped my speed to about 5mph.  I also rolled down my driver side window to get a better look.  I noted that there was no sound and no blinking lights coming from the orb, which made me realize that it was not a helicopter and definitely not an airplane.

932,"UFO flies over city before flashing, witnessed on a mountain.I was sitting on top of Mt. Umunhum with two of my friends.  We were smoking a cigarette when I noticed that slightly over a mountain to my left there was a red orbish looking craft moving similarly to a bumblebee, jolting back as it moved left.  After about 30 seconds of this the craft paused, then started slightly ascending and moving to the right.  It was still redish orange at this point.  About this time the people I was with saw how oddly it was moving.  It started ascending higher and higher before moving to where it was centered from out perspective to the city.  At this point it had gone from more red to slightly more orange and had quick flashes of blue. As it moved over the city the flight patterned changed from a jolty flowing pattern to soaring through the sky above the city until it just stopped.  Once it stopped it alternated between red, orange, blue, and white before flashing what I could describe as an almost yellow light.  The shape seemed to have! changed as well going from a distinct orb to a diamond.  The light being emitted was the shape of a diamond with a gap through the center of the diamond.  It did this for about 30 second or so before going back to a red orb and flying west away.  Being terrified me and my 2 friends were trying to figure out what we just saw for about 10 minutes.  Then around 1 AM, the craft hovers over the mountain northwest from us and starts flying distinctly in our direction, very confidently.  As it got closer I looked away for a second before I hear ""it disappeared"".  At this point we said 'we have to leave now', and as we drive down the mountain I see it once more just floating in the sky.  It was white with an orange tint around the edge of emitted light.

933,"two bright stars seen on a cloudy stormy dayIt was about 8:00 p.m. Tuesday, May 17, 2016, in Kingsville, Texas.  A storm clouds had just passed Kingsville...there was no rain but still enough sunlight.  I looked up at the sky and noticed a bright light almost like a bright star!  I wondered how could I see a star when the sky was completely covered with dark clouds!  I looked around and also noticed another bright star around 1/2 mile from the first one.  I asked myself if it was a drone or what could these two shining objects be?  Where they under the clouds or above...it either case, the objects were like stars blinking on and off and not moving.  After 5 minutes, I contacted the Kingsville Police Department to send an officer to see what I was seeing.  The department was too busy to send someone.  I kept looing at both stars and noticed that one star had completely disappeared.  I kept looking at the other one left for about five minutes.  It was not moving.  I noticed that lighting was traveling from cloud to cloud on the west side, but I kept staring at the only star left.  All of a sudden, the star turned bright ""red"" and traveled to the direction of the lighting.  It moved so fast (without me hearing any sound) as a spacecraft as seem on television.  These two objects were not from earth, in my opinion. These stars to me were attracted to the lighting and one of them headed in the direction of the lighting.  I telephoned the Kingsville Naval Air Station this morning and spoke about what I saw.  That individual said that is was only an electrical event and nothing else.  I do not buy this theory!  I am very skeptical about life beyond earth, but after seeing what I saw… I believe that there is life beyond earth! I am religious and spoke with some religious leaders about what I saw.  They informed me that it was a sign from God to me to ask Him what He wanted from me?  That what I see was only meant for me to see and no one else!  I do believe in God, but cannot accept from these religious leaders what they told me.  Since Tuesday, May 17, 20! 16, I will always believe that there are ""beings"" from space that are watching our earth.

This one has the exact same flashing, floating, vanishing lights.  The following is what happened tonight at about 9:10 p.m. May 17, 2016.I heard a bunch of sirens outside my apartment, so I looked out to see what was going on and what direction they were going in.  I live in a pretty big city and a bad section where there’s always something going on.  I thought I had heard a car chase so that was what had me curious.  It was twilight and the sky was that beautiful mix of colors -of dark blue, light blue, green, yellow, and  then pink and red.  I saw two lights in the far distance rising up into the sky.  I could tell immediately that they were odd by the way they were moving and the way they looked.  They were floating at two different spots.  Blinking on and off.  Red all the time and the white was flashing.  I could tell they were on the horizon but not as far away as stars would be.  They were not planes.  They made no noise.  They flashed on and off, moving at the exact same speed and in the same direction as the other.  Then they simply faded, disappeared, vanished before my eyes.  Just like the ones in 2013.  I could not tell the shape.  All I saw was two lights moving and flashing at the same speed, vanished at the same time.

I'm on Business 17 next to Greg's Cabana facing East looking across 17 towards the ocean.I look up into the night sky as I always do and I see an orange glowing sphere rising up in the sky. Judging from the distance I'm sure that it was out over the ocean.  The color is orange/red just like glowing fire, but no flame or flames.  Round spherical shape and as it began to rise higher, the color was changing to a more red and almost purple like shade and then back to the orange glowing fire color.  The size began to get smaller in diameter and while this was happening the color changed to white and it simply vanished into thin air.This is the first time that I have made a report on this or any site, but not the first time I've witnessed these unidentifiable flying objects.  I can honestly state that you're more likely to observe UFOs in this area than not.  It's that common here out over the ocean.  Over the last 6 years this makes about a dozen sightings for me.  Tonight, I was alone, but every other time there have been other witnesses and we all see the same things, colors, movements, etc.I personally, am of the opinion that somebody knows exactly what these things flying around are and where they come from and go to.

They were in battle formations, I saw at least half a dozen aerial dogfights but not close up, they looked like stars but moved at incredible speeds.

I am no aeronautical expert by any means but it was certainly lower than the normal craft we see flying around here (but I don't know what that elevation is...)

995,"Triangular (V-shaped) flying object spotted in Shanghai, China near Hongqio airport (2016/05/12 @ 23:20)This changes everything.  I’ve always been a skeptic, until this day.  We are not alone and I am now 100% certain about this.  A very unsettling event, here it goes;  12 May 2016 @ 2300 (Shanghai, China)   My wife and I went out in the evening to walk our dog and headed to a newly built public park about 2 km west of the HongQiao airport.  It was a great and comfortable evening with a clear night sky with temperature ranging between 20-22 degree Celsius.We actually walked quite a while during that evening and so needed to take a rest somewhere to cool down our dog.  So we headed to a bridge structure in the middle of the park. My wife sat on the bridge, the dog lied down resting, and I lied down flat on my back, looking up in the sky.  I personally like looking at stars during a clear night sky so whenever I get a chance, I take it and simply lie down flat on my back like this and look up; make wishes, say hi to my long-gone love ones, etc.  Weird behavior I agree but there you go – that’s me!  It’s at this moment that I’ve spotted this V-shaped (triangular) craft with 7 amber color lights on it.  The craft was heading north and was travelling way above supersonic speed.  Certainly faster than anything else I’ve seen flying before (e.g commercial or military fighter jets).  I’d say about twice faster if not more.  As it passed in a straight line right above us, and 3-4 secs later, you could only see the two lights from its tail and it instantly disappeared.  No sounds whatsoever, completely silent.When I first saw the craft, I instantly sat down and pointed the sky with my finger and shouted ‘ufo ufo ufo’ to my wife (it doesn’t take long to figure out what’s happening when you see such a distinctive shape in the sky, 1 second, literally).  All happened very fast however.  As I was pointing up and shouting ufo with a breathless little girl tone, my wife tought I was pulling a silly joke on her so it took her quite a while to finally look up.  Took her about 2 secs to realize I was NOT joking and then looked up.  She unfortunately missed it but reported seeing a strange formation of clouds where the craft passed – where I was pointing with my finger in the sky.  She also reported that the clouds she seen forming disappeared gradually but rapidly.V-shape craft description.  Color:  It all happened very fast, so I had literally 3-4 secs to process what I was seeing.  The craft was the same color of the sky on that evening – possibly reflecting off the yellow’ish ground lighting of the Hongqiao district.  It was certainly not transparent as I could see its very distinctive v-shape.  I was slightly grayer than the background night scene.Size:  Hard for me to judge its size with no reference nearby.  The only thing that was up there were stars and those aren’t much of a reference for sizing.  I can’t even say for sure what altitude this thing was flying at.  I could see some of the details clearly so it had to be more or less 2000meter above us.  Like I said, all happened very fast so this part is rather missing.  From my angle, and judging from other commercial aircrafts flying during that same evening, it was certainly 3 to 4 times bigger than the size of a regular 747 jet plane.7 lights: 7 or 9 lights, I am not 100% sure.  Certainly had one on its nose and one on each side of its tail with 2 (or 3) on the each side of the craft itself.  Those were clearly solid amber color now that I am 100% sure.  Amber as between yellow and red.  Not flashing, not pulsing, just plain simple amber dots evenly distributed around it.Travelling Speed: Faster than anything else I’ve seen before.  Much slower than a shooting star but much faster than a fighter jet flying at sub/supersonic speed.  I’d say twice faster than a military jet and yes, I’ve seen quite a few fighter jets shows during my younger years so I can make this judgement quite easily.And that’s it really.  That’s all I have really.  Like I said it all happened quite fast but I’ve seen just enough to get me to sweat quite a lot, I was nervous, trying to pull jokes at the same time (come and get me I’ve shouted on that bridge lolll), I was not panicking but certainly wasn’t well.  It really hit me when I got home and pulled up google image (keyword “triangular shape ufo”).  Many of the pictures from other ppl who witness similar flying objects really hit hard on me.  Didn’t like the feeling at-all.  We are NOT ALONE :/  Ps.  We stayed on-site a few minutes after the sighting hoping to see a reaction from the Chinese military.  Nothing happened.  Commercial flights were doing their thing roaming the sky as usual, etc.  No jets scrambling, nothing at all.  Very strange.  Either the Chinese are used to these visits, as-in they happen daily, or their radars simply weren’t aware of the craft.  One thing for sure, there was many commercial jets flying on that evening, at the same time, so someone, somewhere must have seen it as clear as I did.Can’t wait to hear.",Duration:3-4 seconds,"Location: Shanghai (China), ",Occurred : 5/12/2016 23:20  (Entered as : 05/12/2016 23:20),Posted: 5/20/2016,Reported: 5/12/2016 10:24:59 PM 22:24,Shape: Triangle

997,"Several triangular lighted objects spotted above Lake Tahoe area.My wife and I are vacationing near Lake Tahoe, and since it is so clear (and this being off-season, there’s not much else to do), she suggested we go star watching.  This was at a little past 10:30PM  It is almost pitch black up here near Heavenly Ski Resort, so the constellations are perfectly bright and visible.  That’s when I noticed a few “stars” that aren’t part of the constellations I am familiar with.  And we noticed them slightly strobing and moving, and then the movements got wilder and we saw that these weren’t single lights, but clusters of lights.  They appeared triangle-ish, but we could make out as many as 9 stripes of light on two in particular.  While watching we saw several lights appear and disappear without getting a chance to make out their shapes.We also saw a plane pass overhead which gave us a comparison to know that these other objects were definitely not planes.  The primary object seemed to be getting closer to us while maintaining it’s relative position against the visible stars in the sky.  We couldn’t tell how far away it was, but it seemed like it was really only a mile or so above us.  At first it had seemed like it was celestial, but as the light formation changed shape into a more triangular pattern, it looked to be near the top of the atmosphere and lowering.  We have no fixed points by which to measure the distance, but we both had the same thought when the lights become more visible that perhaps we were looking at something that was a lot closer than we had initially thought.I used my camera phone to try and see if I could capture an image or video, but nothing in the sky was reading on my phone.  My wife has a professional Nikon D90 with a zoom lens and was also unable to see the objects through the lens finder.  We started to notice that quite a few of these objects were moving but enough to be planes.  They also seemed too high to be helicopters.  It’s frustrating because they were perfectly clear to our naked eyes, but capturing lights in the sky on our phones was not happening.When we came back to our rental, we looked online to see if there were any reports of UFO activity.  I went back outside to our balcony and we saw two more of these triangular objects in the sky flying in erratic patterns.  Mostly they hovered, then they went in straight-ish lines but then would sort-of bug out of pattern and continue.

999,"Column of three vertical solid white lights over Elsmere DE which do 90 degree turn to form triangleThe date and time was Thursday, May 12, 2016, at approximately 9-20 in the evening.  My wife and I were driving along Kirkwood highway from Newark en route to Wilmington, DE, and were approaching the small town of Elsmere.  We were in the vicinity of the VA hospital, when I noticed three solid white lights (i.e. none of them were blinking on/off) in a completely vertical line (like a column) relatively low in the sky directly in front of us, some distance away (perhaps half a mile).  They appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly towards us, as we continued along the straight road.I watched them for around three or four seconds before saying ""what's that?"" to my wife who was driving the car.  A few minutes later (when we were discussing what we had just witnessed) she said she had also seen them before I drew attention to them vocally.  My wife and I agreed that the lights were attached to a solid object, which was much larger than a conventional plane.After a few more seconds, the lights moved slowly to our right, now forming a triangle formation. I had the impression that we had been observing a triangular object with a solid white light at each corner.  When we first saw it, it was oriented perpendicular to the ground such that the lights formed a column (in other words it appeared that the object was initially on its side).  As we got closer, it banked and assumed a horizontal orientation, such that the three lights were no longer in a vertical column but were in a triangle shape.The light at the apex of the triangle was furthest from our vantage point as I continued to observe (my wife focusing on driving), the other two lights behind the light at the apex.  The object (now in a roughly two o'clock location relative to our car going along the straight section of Kirkwood highway approaching Elsmere) was moving away from us in the direction of the light at the apex.The whole event lasted approximately fifteen seconds. As the object moved to our right, it very quickly became hidden from our view due to the stores and houses at the side of the road.  This was further evidence to us that the object was relatively low in the sky - much too low for a conventional plane.  We heard no sound from whatever we saw.Given the evidence of our senses at the time, we regard the possibility that the three lights were not attached to a very large solid object is very small (much too small to reasonably accept) especially given the revealed geometry we witnessed as the lights moved relative to our car.",Duration:15 seconds approx.,"Location: Elsmere, DE",Occurred : 5/12/2016 21:20  (Entered as : 05/12/16 21:20),Posted: 5/20/2016,Reported: 5/12/2016 10:45:40 PM 22:45,Shape: Triangle

The object seemed very close (maybe 100 yards) and pass us horizontally and at the same altitude.  Oddly, the object seemed to pass by very slowly, more slowly than you might expect to pass another flying object going in the opposite direction.  It was clear that the entire object was metallic (chrome-colored) as it reflected against the bright sunlight and was emitting huge plumes of white ""smoke"" similar to an old train steam engine.  From my seat, the object was visible for about 5-10 seconds.  I noticed that there was no vertical wing, no windows, no markings, or any other indication that it was a plane, but I assumed it was a plane given the plumes of smoke coming out of its rear so I didn't give it much thought about it at the time.  Note too that ! there was no indication from any other passengers (except my fiance who was seated at the window and was the one that alerted me to the object)or crew members that they saw anthing unusual.  Later that day and the days to come, I became more and more bothered about what I saw and decided to do a Google search a few days later on  ""metallic UFO cancun"" which resulted in images and videos of ""cigar-shaped"" UFOs that look very similar to the object that I saw.

The moon was only about half full at this point, but I could not identify a noise source and noticed the pulsing almost seemed to move across me - as of it was something tangible.  Seemed to be eminating from south of my location.This noise was almost intoxicating - I did not want to move.

I did see the light slowly change from red to a blueish-green color and then back to red again.  I then saw that a commercial jet was heading right for the light.

1032,"Sonic boom followed by unseen high altitude jet planes circling New Orleans and Gulf of Mexico.Slidell, Louisiana  -  Past Observations Report  -  9 May 2016 Date/Time Temp Dew Point Relative Humidity Pressure Visibility Ceiling Wind Gust Weather  7:53 PM, Mon 75°F 66°F 73% 29.96in 10mi 6000ft South 8mph NA Broken Clouds  At 19:25, I had just checked my watch h because the gnats had arrived to help with the yard work.  While picking up tools facing my shed I heard a muffled bang...but a strong. It was like the noise took a breath.  I could feel the energy suck in and push outward like a volatile explosive as it is triggered by a blasting cap.  The noise also had a kind of twangy echo like a indoor shooting range.  Within 15sec the sound of a jet engine emanated from the same place as the bang.  Putting the pieces together as they came into light led me to the belief that a jet plane was flying at a high altitude due to the cloud ceiling which would give way too much turbulence to achieve super sonic speeds.  And the cloud ceiling also muffled the bang by being denser than air so a portion of the noise would slow, bounce off, and travel along the ceiling instead of being free to instantly pass through air and travel to the ground.  The jet was so high that it was impossible to spot.  It was traveling due south to wards New Orleans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the mouth of the Mississippi River.  I then heard it travel in a North or North West direction, maybe passing as far over as Gulfport, Ms, then coming back up seemingly to the point origin to head south again...possibly near Hammond, La.  These distances are only guesses from the rough speed it had to be traveling, length of time a jet exhaust was heard on a particular trajectory.  It must have circled at least five times, once heading south there was a second exhaust that went its own way once they reached the southern destination.  These intense activities slowed or stopped at 19:55.  Through the night I have heard the jet every couple of hours but just passing by once or twice but nothing kike the roughly half hour of consistent circling.

1033,"Fake plane, or we have hologram and/or cloaking capability.Last year I observed a plane with a contrail from a distance of a few miles.  I kept my eye on it intermittently and upon returning my gaze upon it it had vanished. It was clear in the sky, there were not clouds or anything else obstructing my sight of it.  Trail and all, gone instantly.  Today, while arriving home, I spotted a similar plane and contrail, arising from the West as well.  I thought it would make a good reference photo so that in telling the story, people could see what I'm describing rather than have to use their imagination.  Grabbed my camera a Canon SX120 PowerShot and aimed at the plane from my backyard.  The first photo I zoomed in.  Took a second without zoom, for a realistic perspective.  It was now at about 80 degrees angled from me, heading east, and nearly directly above me.  Took aim for a third shot.  Couldn't locate it.  I quickly checked my camera, everything was fine.  Lowered the camera to relocate the plane in the sky and it is now go! ne.  As before, the sky was cloudless.  It was in plain sight, not fading out and getting lost in atmospheric perspective.  At the rate it was traveling, it should have remained in sight for a few minutes more.  I didn't see it blink out.  It was visible and then I suddenly couldn't find it in my camera.  There one second.  Gone the next.  It happened again.  I grabbed someone from the house immediately to corroborate the fact that there was nothing in the sky, that I wasn't missing anything.

1039,"Light in sky seen in same spot (not moving) for at least 10 minutes.I was walking my dogs on Sunday May 8, 2016, (Clear night with no clouds), when I saw a small flash in the sky just below a star.  I initially thought it was a plane because of the way a plane’s lights blink when flying in the night sky.  However, the flash did immediately occur again.  I continued to gaze in the same direction when about 30 seconds later, I saw a light flash again in the “same spot”.  I thought this was a bit strange.  So I took out my iphone and began to video tape the area I saw this light.  Unfortunately, the iphone camera isn’t the best, especially at night and the distance this thing was.  The light was far away (I think) as you can see on the video.  I filmed for about 4 minutes and then contemplated going back to my house to get a video camera.  I continued to watch and it continued to blink every 30-40 seconds (an estimate) in the same spot.  The light was definitely different from the light from the stars.  I decided to film again with! the iphone and the same occurrence was seen.  It was really strange.  I was pretty excited.  I decided to get home to drop the dogs off and to find my video camera.  I found it, but no battery charge.  I walked back outside to watch again, but I no longer saw the light.When I played the video for the first time, I didn’t even see the light on the camera, even though you can hear me stating “there it goes again”.  I decided to slow the video down with imovie.  In a dark room and watching the video in slomo, you can see the flash of light, but to my surprise, there were other lights that blinked on and then off right after the other one.  Really weird.  I have also zoomed in on the flash of light and it’s completed different from the light zoomed in on a star.  It looks triangular.

1046,"7 lights flying in formation, changing positions and angles of flight.About 1 am this morning, several of us were chatting in our French Quarter courtyard when my wife pointed to the sky to ask what “that” was.  We had turned all of the lights off 15 minutes earlier, so our eyes were accustomed to the dark and we were using my Google Sky app to point out the planets and constellations.  It was a rare clear night (for us) and the stars and planets were particularly sharp.  As I was pointing out Saturn (the brightest point in the sky at the time), my wife pointed out the objects moving in formation about 25 degrees east of Saturn.  There were 7 or 8 points of light, maybe 1/3 the brightness of Saturn and a little smaller, moving slowly towards the North.  2 or 3 in the lead, 3 more fanned out behind and 2 more bringing up the rear.  They would change positions but moved at the same rate of speed in tandem – very slowly – with an occasional stop to regroup before proceeding again.  Far too high, close together and small for any ai! rport or military traffic, which don’t fly that trajectory anyway when approaching Armstrong Airport.  The members of our party watched them, mostly in silence, for close to 15 minutes until they disappeared behind the buildings.  We tried video-ing the lights, but the footage didn’t turn out.

1061,"Craft shone bright white lights for an hour or so into house from above - Telluride, CO.Background that may be relevant:  I live in a remote area outside of Telluride up in the mountains (around 10,000 ft elevation).  A few months ago I was SURE I had seen a disc-shaped UFO land with white lights land below the mountains that comprise our ""view"" out of the picture window in our living room.  At the time, I convinced myself otherwise and figured no one would have ever believed me.  It was gone before I could get a picture and I was sure I must have just mistaken a private airplane since there are folks in the area with them.  That being said, what I saw was NOT the shape or size of a private plane.  It was much larger (perhaps because it was lower than planes usually are) and completely NOT a plane's shape.  I kept this sighting to myself.Fast forward to last night at just after 3am.  I was alone with my toddler at home and was awoken by an insanely bright light being shone coming down into our house angled from above.  It was blinking on and off at a normal interval (for 3 seconds or so lights would be ON, 8 seconds they would be OFF).  It seemed to be coming from above the area in between our home and our neighbor's home which is actually the guest house on the property.  It was like my whole house was getting lit up by a flood light.  Because we live in the middle of nowhere on a mountain top, that amount of light is noticeable and jarring… This went on for about 45 minutes to an hour - pretty sure it was just hovering above our property or parked in the trees?? (I think - I was actually terrified and just put the covers over my head after walking around the house a bit and making sure doors were locked (as if that would matter, right??)).Because my husband is out of town, and I let my 4-year old son sleep in our room with me, I did not want to wake him or scare him and I was way too chicken to actually go out and look at the full shape of the craft (or get a picture - DUH!!), but I believe it is likely a craft like the one I saw before (disc-shaped with white lights on the bottom) based on the way the light was hitting our home and the one across the way. I cannot tell you how insanely BRIGHT the light was. All of the lights in our place were off and this lit the whole place up.I am regretting I didn't get a picture for proof, but I was actually a little worried about my safety because this thing was right outside our window above the house.  Whoever or whatever was in there would have definitely seen me and I did not want to see them!  We had our blinds shut in our bedroom save for a 2-3 inch crack at the very top which is why the light came in and was shining right on my face and woke me, but at the same time, I could not actually see the whole ship either (these are the kind of blinds that drop from the top of the window).  Our bedroom is the one room on the side of the house that the light was coming from but the light was hitting in through to our living and dining rooms as well.Not sure what else to say - I know I didn't fully ""see"" a UFO this time around (though I now believe I saw either this same craft or one like it a few months back), but I KNOW that I fully experienced it.  I can't wait for next time - I'll be ready and think to get phone or video then (if I don't completely freeze up and chicken out)!!!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We asked whether the effects she describes above might have been caused by a sighting of Venus, and she was emphatic in assuring us that Venus could not have caused the flickering effect of light she witnessed in her home.

1064,"Quiet night on the boat disrupted by shaking and bright lights (wife's perspective)My husband and I moored our sailboat at a buoy in Beauty Bay in north-east Lake Coeur d'Alene, ID, on May 6th, 2016.  I awoke to a bright light coming in through the spaces around the cabin door (roof of the cabin) at 10:30 at night.  At first, I thought someone had boarded our boat because it went from perfectly still to rocking intensely from side to side.  This rocking only lasted about 5-10 seconds before it was still again.My husband was also awakened by this and, while he didn't see the light coming from the door, he saw it outside the window.  I urged him to investigate and when he went up, hesitantly, he said he saw a bright light coming from the sky searching the area.When I asked him what was out there, he told me that there weren't any boats approaching or leaving the bay and that there were still no other boats in this tiny bay. He said all he could see was a helicopter searching the area.  I thought this was bizarre since neither of us heard any noise as one might expect from a helicopter or airplane.  When I asked him if it was shaped like a helicopter, he said all he could see was the light, not the body of the aircraft.  He also said that the one bright light was moving in circles searching the area (not the aircraft, just the spotlight).I called the Coeur d' Alene police department and asked if there were helicopters in the area.  The lady I spoke to looked and said that there weren't any police or medical helicopters in the area, but there was one medical helicopter at the south end of the lake.  She also said that, being a medical emergency, even if it had gone through our area, which was unlikely, it wouldn't have hovered or searched with a light.  She then contacted the Spokane police department to see if they had come into Kootenai County and they said their helicopters were in Medical Lake, WA, at that time last night.I'm logical and skeptical and search for scientific explanations.

1065,"Quiet night on the boat interrupted by shaking and bright lights.  (Husband's perspective)My wife and I took our sailboat to Beauty Bay in northeast Lake Coeur d' Alene, ID.  We like this part of the lake because it is secluded and quiet this time of year, with buoys that we can tie up to.   We arrived at about 8 pm and went to into the cabin to sleep at about 9 pm.  No other boats were in the area and there is only 1 house on the bay.At 10:26 pm, I woke up to the boat rocking back and forth pretty intensely, like it would if caught in a storm.  The water in this bay is still and calm, even in the busy part of the year, so I was concerned.  Still in bed, I glanced around the cabin and saw white light coming in from the port side windows.  The boat was still rocking hard, which then woke up my wife. She was scared, and I turned my attention to her.  She said, ""Oh my god, I think someone's on the boat, did you see that light?""  I was looking at her, and away from the cabin entry door, which she said filled with light as though from flashlights from someone above us.She asked me to go check it out.By that point the boat stopped rocking, maybe 15 seconds after I woke up.  I grabbed my phone, turned on its flash light, and tentatively opened the overhead sliding door.  I looked around the cockpit of the boat, and saw nothing.  The water at this point was perfectly calm and the area was awash in silence.  Everything appeared normal and there was no sign of intruders.  I turned to look at the bow of the boat and saw nothing.Up in the southeast sky (or maybe south west, I don't know which direction the boat was pointing at the time) I saw a bright white light that I at first thought was a helicopter.  The light shined down toward my area, but was rotating in circles, as though looking for something.  The craft was relatively low, just above the neighboring hills, possibly lower as it made its way over the bay.The craft made no sound. I assumed it was a helicopter and retreated back into the cabin.We woke up in the morning at 7:30 and talked about the night, trying to rationalize what happened.  I can normally explain events with science or justify them with surroundings, but this time I had nothing.  What rocked the boat in a calm, lonely bay? What filled the cabin with light?  What was the silent craft pointing it's light down toward us?  My wife called the local police, who said there were no helicopters, police nor medical, in the area.  They also called Spokane, who also didn't have any activity in the area.  The lady on the phone recommended we contact the UFO reporting center, which is something I never thought I'd need to do.I am 39 years old and own a marketing company.  I'm college educated and have never touched drugs, nor do I drink alcohol.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with both the husband and wife, and they both sounded to us to be quite sober-minded people.

1069,"Visit to Famous Socorro UFO Landing Site Lonnie Zamora.During early May 2016, my family took a road trip involving visits to CA, AZ, NV and NM.  Of course, we wanted to visit Roswell and Socorro, NM, and we did.  Prior to our departure, I watched my documentaries and videos regarding the Lonnie Zamora UFO incident on April 24, 1964.  I was really fascinated with this case because Lonnie Zamora was a sworn police officer at the time of the incident which I believe makes his testimony and credibility noteworthy.A recent documentary video in particular caught my attention.  2 researchers who were working with Ray Sanford (I believe he arrived on scene April 29, 1964, and was able to perform an investigation with the assistance of Dr. James Allen Hynek) gave a presentation regarding up to date information obtained through continued research into this incident.In particular, was a claim that approximately 1 year after the incident, both Ray Stanford and Dr. Hynek returned to the landing site.  I believe I have seen a few pictures online confirming the same.  It is alleged that Ray Stanford took random snap shots of the area and many, many, years later discovered objects flying in the air  off in the distance.  It is my understanding Ray Stanford, at a later time when appropriate, may share those pictures with the public.While visiting the landing site which has been marked with rocks and a mural memorial to Lonnie Zamora, I decided to take some radiation readings and random photographs of the area. Nothing jumped out during the radiation testing but upon later examination we did discover an object in our photos that was not seen with the naked eye.  To confirm there was something in the air, I did use MUFON's free to the public image analysis tools.  While I am no expert, it does appear to verify we caught something in our photos.  The object appears to be metallic, grey colored and oval/round.In addition, prior to driving to Socorro we visited a Native American petroglyph site approximately 1 hour north.  We took many pictures of the drawings on the rocks.  After we discovered the object in our Socorro photos, we decided to more closely examine our petroglyph photos too.  It was then we discovered in 1 of the photos an object high in the sky that was not visible with the naked eye.  This object appears more oval/elliptical.We are not saying what we caught on our photographs is extraterrestrial in nature.  It could very well be a plane, bird, some sort of flying debris, etc.  However, it is worth noting that at no time did we hear any noise or observe any jet contrails in the sky.  These photos and videos were all taken with a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 mobile phone.  So we were surprised that we captured something with the limited capabilities of a mobile phone vs. a real camera or camcorder.I hope one day Lonnie Zamora's name is fully cleared and any doubt about his testimony will be put to rest.

1077,"Large Triangle of lights in the sky making a weird sound.My father was driving me to Elizabeth City, NC from Greenville, NC to visit my sister. We made a stop in Hertford, NC and visited my grandmother for about an hour or so.  This day was very bizarre when it comes to UFOs..  Earlier, my sister was watching a UFO documentary.  When we arrived in Hertford, NC, and my uncle was watching a UFO documentary.Anyway, We finally left around Midnight.  As we were about to make a left turn to head to Elizabeth City, NC, I noticed 3 lights hovering in the sky out in the field.  I demanded my father to pull over so we could get out and take a closer look.  I told him ""Dude!  There is a UFO over there!  I swear..  Please trust me just pull over.  That thing is huge!""  I was very shocked to see it.So me and my father got out of the car and walked about 10 or 15 feet behind the car so we could see the object behind the trees.  I thought I was going to have a heart attack I was so worked up.  My blood pressure was sky high..At this point it was quite low and not moving at all.  One of the three lights kept going dim.  The object was making a loud swooshing/wah wah sound.  Unlike any sound I have ever heard..  I asked my dad, ""Do you hear that?!  That's the UFO making that noise!  That must be the engine or something""  We were very shocked.  He said he's never seen anything in the sky like that before.  They definitely were not stars.  After staring at the object for a few minutes, we resumed driving to Elizabeth City, NC.  The object was still in the sky.  Very large, I'd say the size of a football field if not bigger.  I said ""This must be a Mothership."" So, as we arrive at my sister's house in Elizabeth City, I ran inside to get my cousin.  Because me and him experienced a UFO sighting about 10 years ago in the daylight.  But that's another story..He came outside with us to view the object.  He said ""Wow seriously?  I was just inside watching a documentary on UFO's!""  I found that very bizarre, as my sister and uncle were also watching documentaries earlier.At this point, it was higher in the sky and 2 of the lights were very dim.  Also, you didn't hear the noise it was making in Hertford.He said, ""That's the mothership!  They were just talking about this on TV!""  I was amazed he said that, because I had just said that about 30 minutes ago, when we first saw it in Hertford.I went back outside at 3AM and the object wasn't there.  It was very cloudy at this point.   This was a very cool experience and I was very happy to experience with a few family members.  You had to have been there to really understand this sighting.  What a crazy night.I was able to capture a few photographs of the object, but they didn't turn out very well.  I will try and add them to this post.Thank you very hearing my story!  - ((name deleted))",Duration:2 hours,"Location: Hertford, NC",Occurred : 5/6/2016 00:00  (Entered as : 05/06/16 0:00),Posted: 5/10/2016,Reported: 5/7/2016 9:40:58 PM 21:40,Shape: Triangle

The jet reappeared to the left of the cloud and the UFO never reappeared on the other side of the cloud.In order for this UFO to exactly intersect the jet at those speeds either has to be a huge coincidence or a controlled maneuver by the UFO.

1105,"Hovered over neighbors farm for a while, 3+ lights, then became VERY BRIGHT (blinding us).  Circled our house a few times and did a 180.It was around 9:30 EST, when me and my mother were driving home from a religious meeting.  Coming down our road we noticed a light in the air that strangely was not moving. Pulling into our drive, we stopped and observed it directly hovering over our neighbors house (which conveniently was a farm house).  Observing it, we quickly came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane.A sudden gasp was heard from our Jeep as the three hovering lights turned into a large white ball of light, like a spotlight, blinding us.  This ended in a matter of seconds. Immediately we called the farmer, but he wasn't able to see it.  We saw it clear as day, it was like nothing we had seen before.Even pulling into our wooded driveway, it was bright enough that we could still see it.  We sat talking to the farmer for around 5 minutes watching the craft go in a back and forth pattern with sharp turns over his house.  Here it starting moving closer to us.We pulled the rest of the way up our driveway, and the garage was having trouble opening (most likely a coincidence, it does it sometimes) so we sat and watched it longer.  At this point it was dangerously close to our house.From this point on and when we got inside, you could see a triangle of different color lights (white, red, green, blue) that changed colors, similarly to an airplane it seemed at first, but this was not functioning at all like an airplane.  Then the whole craft turned red. My father here pointed out that he could hear it, and it sounded like an airplane, until the sound abruptly stopped.  Before it was moving very slowly, but now it was moving quicker and making very sharp terms.Finally, it moved out of our sight, slowly again.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  The only explanation is brand new military craft or alien ship. Coincidentally, I was talking about UFOs to my father a few nights prior, which was strange.  Pictures were not taken due to a lack of a good camera, and my mother yelling at me not to take pictures (Why?  I don't know.) for the fear that ""It might know.""

The first is wide view.  The second is zoomed in, from the same step location, immediately after the first.I did not notice anything in the sky when I took the photos.  My intent was to get a photo of the city at night.Later when looking at the photos, I noticed the row of lights in the clouds.  I can assume reflection in the clouds, or reflection on the camera lens, but a few observations leaves some doubt.  The lights change position in relation to the buildings.  The lights keep their same relative size to the buildings.I take that to be the lights were in the sky above or beyond the buildings, and the lights moved in relation to the buildings.The other item is that the lowest light is brighter than the 7 above it.The sky was cloudy.  I estimate the distance from the photo position on the museum steps to the tall buildings in the photo is 6000 feet, scaling from a map.Please review the photos I emailed and let me know if you think the largest probability is that it was city lights reflecting, and how to discount the relative position change with the buildings.

1113,"Large triangle-shaped object hovering over highwayAt about 12:15am, while traveling North on Everett Turnpike in Nashua near exit 4 I could see 2 white lights in the sky, accompanied by a blinking red light, above the overpass at exit 5, around a mile away.  I immediately assumed it was a plane, since most planes I've seen have white lights and some sort of blinking light on the bottom.  As I got closer to exit 5, I noticed the object was not ""flying"" east-west or north-south like an airplane, but was instead ""hovering"" high above the overpass at exit 5.  As I got even closer, I expected to see the object prove to be a helicopter, perhaps a police helicopter, with it being so close to the Nashua Police department.  Right before I went under the overpass at exit 5 I rolled down my window and got a good look at the object.  It was a dark brown or black colored triangle (not a boomerang shape) with two white lights on each side of all three points of the triangle (almost like quotation mark! s), as well as a red blinking light that blinked about once per second not directly in the center of the bottom of the object, but a little left of center of the bottom.  I also considered it possible that this was a drone, since I have one and am familiar with how they look in the night sky.  But once I came out from under the overpass, I was in total amazement at how big and close it was to me.  It was enourmous, and it was absolutely not a drone or a plane.  I estimate it's size to between a large truck and a fighter jet.  The object emitted no sound that I could hear.

I watch sober.Almost every night, a large orange orb in the sky that is located above Craven road off Sunbeam Road in Jacksonville, Florida.  A planet does not move at will nor do stars while this orb does.  I looked at it one night and thought to myself, if this thing is satanic, evil, it has to do what I say, as that is what the bible says.  So, I looked at and “thought clearly”, “Move away from me if you are evil. “Here’s the weird thing; It did just that.It has two orbs below it that blink constantly.  One blinks dark blue and light blue and the other blinks red, white and green.  The red white and green orb has actually moved on its own, much like a drone, but there are no drones that look like it.  This orb has a saucer shape but you can only see an outline as if it is covered in camouflage paint, it blends with the night sky.  Again, there are no drones that are like this.  It is the size of a very large helicopter but completely quiet, not even a whistle sound like a drone would make.They seem very curious about the people in the apartment complexes on Sunbeam Road for some reason as well.  I have observed a figure with only an outline walking by one of the buildings that looked too skinny and small to be a human. Shaped like a grey but, with a smaller head, barely visible.  These orbs seem to enjoy being near the hill located by Sunbeam Road across from the veterinarian hospital but they have moved location, sometimes sitting above the post office in front of the trees.   There is also an isosceles Triangle located above Sunbeam Road that changes locations quite often and has an odd rounded shape at the bottom.I get a very creepy feeling when I look at it, almost like someone is staring at me.  I have made the attempt to create a drone to fly towards the red, white and green orb, I call it Italy, but, I am stuck trying to figure out a good power source to fly that far.

1131,"Low-flying, dark triangle seen over Easton, PAOn April 30, 2016, at approximately 23:50, a dark, triangular shaped object, was seen by my brother and I, flying slowly, approximately 500 ft. above the treetops. Its distance was only about 2 miles from where we had sighted it, flying over the West Ward of the city.  I could only guess at the size of the craft, possibly being 70-75 ft. from tip to tip of the wingspan.When first noticed, the bright-white lights on its underside were facing us, as it was banking 90 degrees on its port side.  There were at least four, but more probably six lights, all white and very bright.When I had first spotted it, the aircraft was flying in an easterly direction in this 90 degree position, then it hooked sharply and headed NNW, immediately leveling out its flight after completing the turn.  I believe one red and one green, slow-flashing light was positioned respectively on the left and right wing-tops as it headed away from us.The total time of observation was about 30 seconds.I've never seen a craft of this size move this slow, traveling this low and making such an immediate hard turn.  Personally, I wouldn't doubt if this was a military aircraft, as it was very exotic to me, but didn't strike me as being non-terrestrial.  Some people that I have described the sighting to, believe it may have been a military drone.

1147,"3 slow moving orbs chased by fast walkerOn Friday night, 4/29/2016, between 9:15pm and 10:00pm, I observed 4 objects I could not identify as aircraft.  Three of the objects were egg or spherical shape, with a red/yellow/white illumination with a slight flickering of these colors. These 3 objects were separated in time by about 20 seconds, moving towards the ocean in the direction of Monterey.  Each of these 3 objects traveled at the same speed, which was slower than a small fixed wing aircraft.  Both the 1st and 2nd object appeared to stop dead in the sky, at the same point in the sky, for at least 10 seconds.  They then resumed their same speed and disappeared from view, but it seemed to me that the extinguishment of their light was not a function of moving ever farther away, the lights just went out.  Each object was the same size, and  I measured with my pinky finger held out at about 30 degrees elevation.  The object took up less than half the width of the nail of my pinky finger.  The objects were s! ilent, and emitted no trails.  I estimate the height of these objects in the hundreds, but not  thousands of feet.I'm not sure if the third object stopped dead and moved on like the first two. I was startled to view a very fast moving streak in the sky proceeding in the general direction of these objects. The speed of this ""streak"" would be about the same as a military jet traveling at a supersonic speed at low altitude.  While I was not startled by the initial 3 ""orb like"" objects, the fast moving streak seemed ""wrong"".  Another way to describe this streak would be about the same as a meteor one can often see during meteor showers. I thought it was a meteor, but the angle thru the sky was too flat or horizontal and too low. This ""streak"" trailed a smoky, silverish color.  There was no sound. This streak quickly vanished in the direction of the other objects. I can't estimate the size of this streaking object. It was projectile shaped.I sighted these objects on a neighborhood street where I walk every day, both day and night.  I am familiar with the behavior of aircraft - both large jets and small planes as to  their lighting and travel time in this sky, as well as to what sounds could be present, or not present.  Sometimes even small planes are silent at even short distances.  During this sighting, both light and larger aircraft were higher up in the sky. So, the progression of lights would be these unidentified objects, with light planes and commercial traffic above them, and then the stars above those aircraft.My guess is that the first three ""orbs"" could have been lanterns, except that the first two stopped dead in the sky and then resumed their travel. Another possibility is drones. The streaking object is why I am reporting this. It seems an odd coincidence that these  slow moving ""orbs"" were chased by a very fast object.I am writing this report about one hour after the event. I am a retired technician/engineer, 64 years old. I am offering this report in the event others may have seen some of what I did, especially the fast moving streak.Mr. Davenport, thank you for keeping records of these sightings.",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Santa Cruz, CA",Occurred : 4/29/2016 21:45  (Entered as : 4/29/16 21:45),Posted: 5/6/2016,Reported: 4/30/2016 12:06:42 AM 00:06,Shape: Egg

After it flew out of my view, I immediately ran to the adjacent bedroom to see if I could see it out of that window.  I could not, so I grabbed a pen and paper to draw what I saw, as I did so I looked at my phone and saw that it was 11:11.  The craft was flying southeast towards the Mississippi River.

The strange thing is, this craft was coming from the direction of the runway at nearby Paine Field airport where planes take off and land, but we knew that it could not have just taken off from the runway because it was moving too slow, and was too high since it was so close to the runway.  My dad and I then noticed the craft seemed to climb a few feet higher with its back end in the air and its front lowered at an angle. We watched the craft drift along to the south for about five minutes.Then before we knew it, the craft, which was still visible and not too far off, quickly started fading and disappeared against the blue sky just moments before a large airliner appeared from the south as it was getting ready to land at the Paine Field runway.  We are not sure what this craft was as the entire duration of it went from the north eastern sky to the south.  The amazing thing is, is how it disappeared entirely so quickly since it traveled so slow.We would like to remain anonymous at this time, but will report any possible future sightings.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1194,"Strange maneuvers from lighted aircraftUfo sighting 4/24/2016 White House, Tn, 37188.  Walking North back from my garage to my house at 10:28pm, I spotted a red light, very bright, in the sky, Northeast from my perspective. It was moving in my direction as I spotted it.  I first thought it was a typical airplane as I live not far from Nashville International  airport approximately 30-40miles south of me and  I see airplanes frequent.  As I was walking up my drive I gave it a second glace and it seemed to stop, so I stopped to get a better look. It just sat there still , I could clearly see a single bright red, and a single flashing green.  I wasn’t sure if it was a single red or two reds that were possibly close together.  I was tyring to figure out what I was looking at when it made a u turn maneuver and started back northeast and then stopped again.  I started walking up my drive quickly as I was trying to get passed a tree until I reached my back door.  I stood there watching it spin and do small maneuvers  almost dancing like.  It never made any noise that I could hear.  I called my brother, he lives next door,  in hope he could run out to see it as well. He was not home but driving home  just seconds away, I was talking to him on the phone as it again turned and flew out of site. He missed it by merely seconds.  The great thing was my brother managed to trip the motion sensor on my front porch cam as he is driving toward me, so I did get about 8 seconds of footage before it moved out of site.Now I’m not saying it was aliens, but a true UFO certainly from my perspective.  I have a fascination with the skies and frequently look at stars and anything moving in them.   Actually I think it was probably military according to lights. It did seem to move like a helicopter, but it made no noise that I could here.  I live in a very quiet town and I can here planes and heilcoptors on a regular basic, even the more stealthy military choppers I can here at that distance, but yet I never heard any noise.	I was excited to finally see something I couldn’t explain what it was.  I have very good perception of different  things I see in the sky.  I am a model aircraft pilot and enthusiast and I’m aware of the possibility of a drone or an unmanned craft.  It didn’t  strike me as any model type craft.  Funny thing is, it almost seemed  like it saw me looking at it and it did’t know what to do.

I felt they were moving extremely fast, given their distance from us.  The center two lights appeared to cross each other's paths while they were moving.  They were in our north eastern sky, appearing to be travelling south easterly. They disappeared into the distance and we went back to our fire. About 15-20 minutes after this, we saw the same, or a second formation come over again, travelling in the same direction. This time all the lights stayed fixed in their positions but were in the same shape and moving at the same rate of speed. We identified several planes all at different altitudes, arrivals and departures from the major airports and several cross Atlantic flights that all looked regular.

1222,"Strange lights that fly in unison blink out when observed.Early this morning, I got up and went out on my back deck to enjoy the beautiful morning weather and night sounds.  It was still dark and the sky was clear.  I sat down for about 2 minutes, then looked up at the stars.  I don't know the constellations, but I could clearly see several points of light without any obstructions.  Directly in front of me (facing northwest),  I could see a group of three stars immediately flanked by two other lights to my right.  At first, the two lights were stationary so I didn't really think about them.  But soon they both started to slowly move from their stationary position to my left.  I thought it odd that satellites would be still and then move in apparent unison.  With my right arm fully extended, I estimate they were a hand width apart.  Very high up but still very clearly visible.  I watched them move slowly in unison, then stop in unison, then resume moving in unison in the same direction.  They followed their motion f! or approximately a five count, then the lead light simply went out, while the second light continued to move in the same direction.  When the second light reached the point where the first light went out, it too went out.  No clouds, no obstructions at all.  I'm an avid UFO person so naturally I interpreted this as a possible sighting and said out loud ""why do you always blink out when I see you?  How do you know I'm looking at you?""  I thought this might illicit some kind of response, but they didn't reappear.  I've been fooled by birds before, but these lights were too bright and way to high to be birds.  I ruled out airplanes because they went from stationary to moving and I didn't hear any jet-related sounds like normal when a high flying jet passes over.  Helicopters don't go that high, or I'm not sure why they would, and again no noise.  Perhaps some kind of experimental craft that can go stationary, then move with no noise.  Just seems odd to me.  I've seen! these lights before and always just as I notice them, they bl! ink out.This pattern of seeing them, then they disappear suggests to me whoever they are, they know I'm watching them.

1223,"Cigar (?) shaped object with roughly 7 dim lights flies over North AustinIt is 4:28 AM as I type this right now.At approximately 2:45 A.M. I decided to go for a late night walk on a nature trail near Walnut Creek in Nortwest Austin.  I stepped outside my front door and noticed an acrid smell, which I would describe as being like burning copper wires.  I could smell it for several yards until I got near to the trail, where the only thing I could smell was soggy Juniper and Live Oak bark.While heading back home after a walk up the trail, I noticed something in my peripheral vision in tne sky, at 3:32 AM.  I looked at it for 5-8 seconds. It was a very long, thin, and dimly-lit dark object with roughly 7 distinctly spherical lights on it.  I watched it fly across the sky and out of view (trees obscured my vision).  It appeared to be dropping lower as it zipped across the sky.I have no training in how to discern the size and distance of objects that are far away, but my intuition tells me it was roughly 1200 feet in the air, nearly a half mile away, and maybe 400 feet long.I must emphasize that this object was very dimly lit and that it would have been very difficult to see it the sky wasn't cloudless, and the moon as bright as it is tonight.  It was a very bright night.  The lights on this object were like weak LED lights.The object was moving from South to North at around 300-400mph over Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park and headed toward 1-35.  I was located near the St David's Medical Center building on the railroad tracks.I am 100% certain this was not a plane because it made no noise at all.The moment I saw the object I got an ominous sensation and the hair on my head and body stood up.  After I lost sight of it I immediately ran out of the trail and on to Park Bend Dr, and sprinted home.I would describe this object as being more like a drinking straw than a cigar.",Duration:5-8 seconds,"Location: Austin, TX",Occurred : 4/23/2016 03:32  (Entered as : 04/23/2016 3:32),Posted: 4/29/2016,Reported: 4/23/2016 2:40:55 AM 02:40,Shape: Cigar

I thought they might be drones, but not skinny at all.  Then it appeared that two of them emitted short white cloud-like “chemtrails,”  one each.  I watched these for a short time, floating in the wind.  They started to spread out as chemtrails do.UFO’s disappear. I looked away for no more than a second and when I looked back, the formation of 5 had disappeared completely.  They were nowhere in the sky. But the “chemtrails were still there, and started to change shape (as chemtrails never do  -- they just spread out.)  From the center of each a bulge formed.  One of the bulges drifted down, still connected, so the effect was that of a right angle.  The other bulge did not drift, but was more rounded than straight.

The green lights looked as if they were attached to two separate vehicles one following the other in trail by what looked like, compared to the airliners, about one half mile.

They appeared to be moving much faster than and above the airliners.Each light was a single light that in size was about the same or a little larger visual angle as the forward facing lights of the airliners.

Then, as they were pretty far off but still visible, the lights started blinking completely but perfectly opposite to each other.

I ducked down, looked up and saw both clearly.  They were shaped like a lifesavor candy, round and glowing orange.  (with a hole or darkness in the middle)  Both were stationary in the sky, the right one higher up.  Within 20 seconds of spotting the objects, I pulled over to safely observe them.  I exited my vehicle and excitedly called my sister, to see if she could see them from her nearby home.  (She didn't answer, I left a message of what I was seeing on her voicemail)  I then reached in my car for my kindle fire, to try and record this event. (my phone camera sucks)  As I did, the object on the right turned. (like holding a lifesaver candy in your fingers and turning it sideways)  It lost it's glow at this point.  The sides and back were dark with no glow.  It proceeded to shoot off higher into the sky and slightly westward, disappearing within 3-4 seconds.  There was also the slightest blue hue flash, like a quick burst of acceleration from the backside, pinpoint small.  As my kindle fire turned on, the second object then turned sideways/away from me (once again losing its bright orange glow) and followed a similar path as the first object, rising slightly and to the west, again disappearing within 3 to 4 seconds.  The side/backside of the craft gave off no glow, just a slight shimmer of outline from the brightness on the other side.

1266,"Three white lights were hovering in the Terre Haute area.The date of occurrences are between April 19-24.  I saw these objects while visiting my family in Terre Haute, IN.I’m a smoker and a night owl and had to go outside to smoke.  As I watched the night sky, usually from 11pm to 3am, I would notice one object that frequented the northeastern sky.   Another appeared on occasion southwest of it.  A third appeared in between the two on only two nights.  One night, I saw two flying across the sky as if together; however, one was at a higher altitude than the other.  At the time, I wondered why two planes would have been allowed to fly so closely together.  Turns out, they were not planes.The objects were very high in the sky and appeared to be bright stars.  All three had a steady white light.  I also saw the haphazard flashing of a green light, and sometimes a red one pulsating from each.  The objects were so high in the sky that I couldn’t make out a definite shape; however, the pulsating colored lights may have been underneath the objects as if suspended from helicopter skids.  It is possible that the objects were triangular but that is only speculation.The northeastern-most seemed to be the most active with its flight path.  All three objects seemed to hover most of the time but sometimes would move ahead, execute a tight circle, then move forward again.  They all stayed in their designated areas.  Their actions were similar to a remote control toy being repeatedly moved then stopped.  Sometimes, when executing a circle, a turn, a sideways maneuver or acceleration, bursts of firefly-looking exhaust emitted from them. .I believe that Terre Haute is in the flight path of some planes leaving Indianapolis International Airport.  On more than one occasion, I was able to compare the planes’ pulsating lights and chemtrails of jets to the UFO’s.  The jets were probably close to their highest altitude but were not nearly as high as the UFO’s.I also compared the objects to the stars.  The objects were at a much lower altitude than the stars but much too high to be planes or helicopters.The only background was the night sky.  The objects were only visible at night.

The “front” of the object appeared to be similar to what the length of a typical commercial passenger jet would be at that same position in the sky.What caught my attention the most was the way the object was moving – up, down, side to side, back and forth, fast, slow, doing “turns on a dime”, and having such sudden acceleration to “hop” around the sky while it was changing its direction.  Sometimes it was moving fast, other times slower.  No conventional aircraft – plane (jet or not), blimp, or helicopter – could have done these maneuvers, especially at speed.  It displayed varying rates of speed, which were not linear, and it did not matter whether it was climbing, turning, etc.  There was no correlation of direction of movement to change of speed.  It certainly wasn’t a balloon, either.  The area of the sky in which it appeared is just west of the usual flight path of jets, yet there were no aircraft in the area that I could see until right before it disappeared.I have lived near military bases and airports and have never seen aircraft do these types of maneuvers.  I did attempt to video the object but there was too much ambient light for it to show up.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Goodlettsville, TN",Occurred : 4/18/2016 21:28  (Entered as : 04/18/16 21:28),Posted: 4/22/2016,Reported: 4/18/2016 9:31:46 PM 21:31,Shape: Unknown
1278,"Glimmering ball of light seen low on horizonI was hanging out with my husband and some good friends in a yard around a fire pit around 9:25pm Pacific Standard Time.  We were all talking and laughing, and all of a sudden a bright round object caught my eye as I was gazing West along the horizon.  It appeared to be a “ball” or point of bright glimmering light, and it flickered different colors: red, white, blue, and maybe green.It was visible just above a stand of trees obscuring the horizon, and was in a solid position in relation to an electrical pole and wire, so we could all judge its lack of movement.  It appeared to not move, and just hover in one spot in the sky for close to one hour.  It did move very slowly over the course of this hour, however.  The only reason we could perceive this was because of the electrical wire, and its position around it.  But as I said, the movement was so slow that it wasn’t perceivable otherwise.It was quite far away - I cannot guess how many miles or kilometers, but it was so far away that we got out the binoculars to get a better look at it.  It was very difficult to focus on (just from the unsteadiness of our arms holding up the binoculars) but from the best of my knowledge it just appeared to be a ball, or point of light.  It continued to flicker different colors, and was very beautiful to look at.Towards the end of the hour, it seemed to recede and the flicker faded as well.  It very slowly got further and further away, as well as closer to the horizon (and trees that were blocking our view).  It finally moved behind a tree, and we could no longer see it.

As I was outside I noticed a rectangular shape in the western sky, moving slowly and quite low.  It did not have the usual red/green lights on wing tips—it had no visible wing tips.  What it did have is two rows of lights which reminded me at first of a domino. However, the front two lights were white, blinking (not appear to be strobe) and the others were various jewel toned colors of blue, green, yellow, red and possibly orange.  The object was about a mile and half downrange 25 degree and under 2000', closer to 1300-1500', heading WNW (as if flying to Eglin AFB).As I tried to determine if it had 8 or 10 lights, disregarding the colors I saw and trying to count (there were no “middle dots” of lights like on a domino) another rectangular craft appeared, about a mile 20 degree NNW of me at the time, at maybe 1000'.  It, too, had  lights but all were white and it only had 8.  Then I knew the first one had 10 lights.  The second craft went dark, which is why I didn't notice it at first.I tried to take photographs with iPhone which only showed a non-round shape and no colors.  I went into the house for my Canon T3i but the battery was dead.  I returned to the back yard to finish viewing the object(s).  The second rectangle became visible once more and then dark again and I did not see it again.  It had lights on less than 30 seconds both times.There was limited moonlight (moving from 1st quarter to full) , low groups of clouds moving in and heavy variable winds (a front clashing with sea breezes?) The Sun Life stadium is just east southeast, as is Miami International, slightly farther and southeast and Ft. Lauderdale AP north, with North Perry (small ap) 4 miles due east.  Plenty of air traffic since new runway opened MIA 2 years ago.At first thought was a blimp, but saw no shape and am not aware of any lighting configuration.  There were no events at the stadium that I am aware of but a music festival in Ft Lauderdale.  Since the craft were moving slowly I did at first think blimp, but have never seen 2 blimps in the air at the same time in over 60 years.  Plus, the craft were flying too fast for blimps in the heavy winds but too slowly for jets.I then thought of helicopters flying some kind of lighted panels, but there was not enough sound (was there any?) of engines tugging anything in the wind.  Helicopters fly overhead all the time.At one brief moment the clouds allowed the moonlight to reflect more on the clouds and I thought I saw a giant circular shape above (as if attached to) the 10 lighted rectangle...but it was so brief it could have been my imagination.  It was only grey and would make the craft 3x  in diameter of the width of the light “panel”.I've viewed the stealth bomber  flying at about 300' overhead near HAFB before US was admitted we had it...viewing/securing?

1306,"Disc or spherical object moves over activity occurring on roof of tall building; appears to observe activity.April 16, 2016, between 5:45pm and 6:15 pm Vancouver, Canada, at the Queen Elizabeth Theater.I was sitting in front of the Queen Elizabeth Theater on Hamilton Street facing SW.  You can actually see the exact location I was sitting at and the building I'm going to reference by typing in the following url (google maps): https://www.google.com/maps/@49.2802229,-123.1138337,3a,75y,134.77h,89.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stq4hKv_aL179G_0htw5Qcg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1  This url will bring you to the exact location and you will be facing the same direction I was and seeing what I was seeing.I was sitting right there on the benches in front of the plaza and the building I'll be referencing is the tallest building on the left in the distance.  The large building on the left in front adjacent to the plaza is the Queen Elizabeth Theater.I had arrived early to an event and so I was just sitting there looking at the city when a man on the very top of the distant building on the left caught my eye.  He was wandering along the edge of the building looking over it.  I became very alarmed thinking that he was going to jump off the building.  I was very intent on watching him when way up high to the right (up from the flag poles) a dark disc or sphere shaped object caught my eye.  It just appeared beneath the clouds.It began moving toward the man on the roof, and as it approached him, I could tell that it was moving closer in our direction (later I determined it was heading NE).  It came over the top of the man and for a moment I thought I was going to witness an abduction, it just stopped and hung there, as though observing him.It was much higher than the man and he didn't seem to notice it as he was looking down over the edge.  Another man appeared and the two of the men began talking, as they turned to walk in the other direction, away from the edge, one of the men pointed to the sky, and both of them momentarily seemed to be looking at the same object I was.  They then proceeded to walk out of view (away from the edge) and the object then moved back in the same direction it had come from and disappeared into the clouds.It was very windy that evening, at least up high, as birds were taking advantage of the winds and sailing at high speeds across my view.  The disc shaped object made no sound, wasn't effected by the wind, it traveled in a general north easterly direction, came to a complete stop, waited about 60 seconds, and then traveled back the way it had come and disappeared into the clouds.Meanwhile, I had my cell phone and could have videoed the whole thing,  I even thought about videoing it but thought it was so far away it would be too hard to capture on a cell phone video. In hind sight, I could kick myself now, it would have probably been a very interesting video.The weather data for that day and time was:  Wind velocity:  9mph.

1351,"Location:  Northeastern Spalding County, Georgia Time frame:  22:42 hours to 22:51 hours Eastern  On 13 April, 2016, I was following my regular route to work; Highway 155 North in Spalding County, Georgia bound for McDonough, Georgia.  As I was approaching the county line about to cross into Henry County, I noticed a light off to the northeast, roughly over Frog Road and the community of Luella.  I was travelling at approximately 55-60 MPH, the sky was overcast, with prevailing winds coming out of the northeast, air temperature 57o.  A slight and intermittent rain was present in patchy areas, but barely detectable.  The cloud deck was high, but solid.  At first glance, I presumed the object was a helicopter, perhaps a med-flight bound for Spalding Regional Hospital in Griffin, Georgia.  As I watched it however, it became apparent that it was not a helicopter.  My first instinct as a retired emergency communications officer (911/police/fire radio operator and supervisor, critical incident response commander) was that since the object was relative to the high-tension power! lines that cross the highway,  I was seeing a power line on fire.  I passed under the power lines and made a u-turn to double check.  As I approached the power lines (heading south), I looked for signs for signs of fire, but the lines were clear.As I passed the power lines and crossed back into Spalding County, the object crossed the highway from left to right and was then concealed by a tree line to my right approximately 600 yards from my position.  I cleared the tree line, and the object was no longer visible.  I decided to pull into a dirt road (Johnson Road Extension) to turn around and abandon any further attempt to view the object.  As I pulled onto 155 and headed north, I spotted the object again almost in the exact same position I was in when I first sighted it, except it was then off to the northwest (left), and relatively stationary.  I stopped the truck and watched it as it appeared to descend roughly over the Cole Reservoir.  There is a large golf community (Heron Bay) located where the object appeared to descend.  I had no other witnesses, and, unusually, there were no other vehicles travelling on 155 in either direction when this occurred.I cannot quite find a technical description to articulate the object I saw.  I was unable to determine a shape at all.  The light was variable in magnitude; at its brightest, it was about as intense as a street light and amber/orange in color (when the illumination intensified, the spectral range was nearly in the white, but generally dark to amber/orange).  Its movement was generally horizontal, with some vertical movement; much like a plastic bag that has been caught by the wind.  The consistency of the color and magnitude of its luminescence was similar to the manner in which an ember emanates light as it rises from a fire.  Its speed was also variable, and I would estimate it moving at its fastest during the sighting as no more than 100 MPH, and as slow as stationary.I have never seen anything like this.  We live in an area that has historically been free from light pollution, use a telescope for stargazing regularly, and see satellites and high altitude aircraft regularly.  I took one or two flight lessons while in high school, and grew up near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, so I am no stranger to aircraft and flight patterns (at the time of the sighting, Hartsfield had outbound traffic at approximately 10,000 feet, northeast to southwest, roughly 2 minutes between aircraft).  This object gave the impression that it was closer than it appeared.  The illumination was not configured; it was apparently “random” lighting, as though it moved all about the surface of the object, but concentrated primarily at a ventral, abaxial angle from my point of view.The best rough coordinates I can provide are as follows: First sighting:  33o 20’01.81” N x 84o09’58.2” W (moving) Second sighting: 33o 19’14.65” N x 84o 10’56.66” W (moving) Third Sighting:  33o 19’59.51” N x 84o 11’52.30” W (stationary/descending)  (Note: the first and third coordinate readings are roughly parallel, minus about a thousand horizontal compass feet, I think.)  As a retired emergency communications officer, my professional reputation does not compel me to report such things, but my instincts tell me I saw something odd.  I am not familiar with drones, but would not rule out the possibility of someone with an illuminated drone playing around.  I researched footage for any relevant similarities and they were somewhat, but not entirely consistent with what I saw.  I was unable to take a picture as my cellphone will not zoom and the picture would therefore not have been of any use.  I just thought that since this was the first time I’d ever seen any such thing I might report it to somebody on the outside chance any similar sightings in the area or time frame were reported, or may be reported.I left a message with my name and number on your voice mail should you have or need any further information.Many Thanks for Your Time and Attention….",Duration:9 minutes,"Location: Luella, GA",Occurred : 4/13/2016 22:42  (Entered as : 04/13/06 22:42),Posted: 4/15/2016,Reported: 4/13/2016 10:05:23 PM 22:05,Shape: Unknown

1359,"7+ Craft spotted from rooftop.  Quickly changing direction.  Not convinced to be extraterrestrial.My friend and I were on my roof, smoking a cigarette (where we normally smoke, to avoid going downstairs) and we saw a bright light that appeared to be a few miles outside Kentland.  We actually thought it was a rocket because of its upward motion.  I have no judge on how fast it was travelling, but it came to an abrupt stop and moved horizontally right, then stopped and moved vertically upward.  After a brief stop, it moved diagonally upwards and to the right.  Then, it covered a distance of over six miles in under a minute, flew directly over-head, at some altitude past Earl Park and over Fowler.  When it flew by, it looked like a normal aircraft carrier.  But the speeds it was moving suggested it couldn’t have been, as it was making several tight turns and had only one bright light on the nose.  When we looked upwards we counted around seven different craft, but none came close to us.  They all had similar movements, vertical to dead stop to lateral movements.  They kept changing directions.  We headed inside to do a quick google, and because it was rather cold, but when we went outside (around five minutes after ten thirty) the craft were gone.  When we went downstairs, my dog was staring at the door and when we came close he snapped at us.  Which is incredibly unusual for him.

We noticed a small cloud about 30 degrees elevation ahead of us and below it was a long grey smooth shape.  Its length was about twice the diameter of the moon.  It looked like it could have been a cylinder - or the rounded edge of a flat object.  The bottom edge was less distinct than the top and faded abruptly to the blue of the sky, much the same as how the moon looks when viewed in the daytime sky.  Apparently it was very high  to have that effect - and very large.Sketches sent by e-mail.  We watched the object move left-to-right across our field of vision for about a minute.  We couldn't stop to take a picture and we lost sight of it when the road turned.We were at: Lat: 35.7, Lon: -114.9 according to Google Earth.It did not have a cloud texture and was moving relative to the cloud, approximately east.  The clouds were not perceptively moving.

The other members of my family also saw it.I called 911 and told them that there was an unusual craft in the sky and I was told it's probably a helicopter out looking for a missing person.  Firstly, there was no searchlight on the craft, and even if they were using infra-red there was no circular movement suggesting the craft was looking for anything. Within one minute of hanging up, the craft slowly turned round and moved in the opposite direction.

We could see it over a tree line rising 80 feet, as we stood about 100 feet away from those trees.  The flash was to the southeast, and moved in an eastward direction.  The object seemed to be far away in the sky, above an airplane flight path at 30,000 feet; closer then a satellite.  I thought something was exploding in space, like a decommissioned space station or maybe a larger pile of space trash.

1398,"White lights going around massive circular objectIt was the night of April 09, 2016 as I was riding my bike back home from getting something to eat in Redlands, CA.  For a while I enjoyed watching the sunsets, walking in the rain, and looking up at the stars, so as I was looking up at the night sky I noticed two lights crossing back and forth from each other.As I continued to ride home, I thought the lights were just a couple of helicopters.  5 min later I saw the lights again, but they seemed closer and I could see them more clearly.  The two lights were not any aircraft as they were moving too fast back and forth.  So I got my phone out to try to take a video but it was too dark but for some reason I could take clear pictures, so I spent and hour taking numerous pictures as the objects disappeared and reappeared every few seconds.  They were not red or blue but just a plain white colored light, so a good 30 min passed before I finally decided to go home.Once I got home, I've noticed a pattern of the lights, they were not two objects passing back and forth, but two lights going around this one circular object.  I saw this by the way the lights pointed as they disappeared and reappeared in this pattern behind the clouds in the sky.  I don't know if the object was the shape of a sphere, circle, oval, or cylinder as I only saw the lights going in a circular motion.  The best way to describe  what a saw was this circular object with two white lights on the object going around it.  Three hours later I decided to go outside to see if the lights were still there and they were.  My father, sister, and I saw these lights.  I would say the object was pretty massive, no where near the size of an airplane.  The way the lights were traveling around it I would approximate the size as the length of 10 planes or even bigger.I don't believe I was abducted as I kept track of time because I've heard stories before and I haven't had any physical harm.

It was moving at a rate that would be consistent with a low-flying small airplane.  There were no running lights, just a bright steady light.  I instantly realized it was an unusual light and quickly called my wife outside.  As I turned back to continue watching, as my wife came out to see, I realized there were two lights.  I pointed out the second one to her.  If this had been a small aircraft at 5,000 to 7,000 feet, we would have easily heard engine noise.  I can't make a good guess of altitude, as there was no way to compare it to anything at the time.The first object I saw was the brighter and larger of the two.  It was slightly brighter than Jupiter is tonight.  My wife and I ran to the east about forty feet to get beyond the trees which were blocking our view momentarily.  She comment that the brighter light seemed to have a shape.  I said it had an angular look and she said, ""Like a boomerang,"" to which I replied, ""Or a crescent shape.""  The color of the brighter object had a  very slight a warm hue, the dimmer object appeared white.  We both watched as the two lights continued eastward at a steady rate, then disappeared behind the peaks of Prater Mountain.  Total elapsed time was about fifty seconds.  Total degree of travel, approximately WNW to ENE from the time I first saw them is about eighty degrees of sky, from my left to my right.The brightest object was about twenty to twenty-five degrees off the horizon.  The dimmer smaller object was closer to thirty degrees off the horizon. The two were separated by approximately three degrees horizontal and five degrees in a downward angle of fifty degrees, the brighter being below and to the right of the dimmer light.

1421,"Two flashing lights in the night sky moving very slowlyI am a male, 63 years old, with 20/20 vision (corrected) and in reasonably good health.  I live in a small town on the Southern Oregon coast, and I was in front of my house last night, viewing the night sky, and thinking about nothing in particular.  The sky was crystal clear, with lots of stars and star formations visible to the naked eye, and I observed Orion’s Belt, the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, to mention just a few star formations.  As a reference, my house is roughly 90 feet above sea level and the front of my house faces exactly northwest (plus or minus 1 degree).At around 10:30 PM, I was staring at the night sky and saw a flash of light, directly in front of me (facing northwest) at an angle of elevation of approximately 45 degrees.  The diameter and brightness of the flash was close to the same diameter and level of brightness as one of the brighter stars I was viewing at the time, and I assumed that a passing cloud had blocked it out of my vision.  That said, there were NO clouds in the sky last night.  The flash appeared, stayed illuminated for roughly two or three tenths of a second, and then disappeared.About one second later, another flash of light appeared, roughly four or five degrees below where the first flash appeared.  It was the same diameter and the same level of brightness and duration as the first flash.  About five seconds later, the same pattern appeared again and in the same location and same angle of elevation.  The distance between the flashes stayed constant; roughly four or five degrees of elevation.  This pattern of flashes continued, repeating every five seconds or so, staying in the same location in the sky.  The third time I saw the two flashes of light, I pointed my index finger where they appeared in the sky, and held my arm as steady as I could, just so I would have a point of reference.After about three minutes, the flashes started moving south very slowly along the same angle of elevation (approximately 45 degrees).  When they moved to the SSW position in the sky, from my northwest facing position, they then started slowing moving higher in elevation.  When they reached approximately a 60 degree angle of elevation, which took approximately three minutes, they stopped and stayed in the same relative position (still pointing my index finger at them) and stayed in that position for another three or four minutes.  The flashes of light then started moving very slowly further south.There is a large pine tree blocking my view, just beyond the SW corner of my property, and when the tree started to block my view of the flashing lights, I got up from the chair I was sitting in and walked further northwest so I could see the lights better.  They continued in a southerly direction and when they got directly south of me and over the Pacific Ocean, they disappeared.  I continue standing there for a few more minutes, but they didn’t reappeared.At no time during this ‘event’ did I hear ANY sound; no near or far off jet engines from either a high or low altitude commercial or military plane.  We have a very small airport north of our town, but rarely do planes land there at night.  They are all small, privately owned planes as well, primarily prop-driven, although there is at least one small Learjet that we see occasionally.  There is no noise or air pollution here (no industries) and with a population of only 6000, the noise level at night is VERY low.  It’s a small and very quiet town, especially at night.On nights when the weather is good, I sit in front of my house and stare at the sky, mostly because we can see SO many stars at night here.  It is a star gazer’s paradise and I know several people who have telescopes, although I do not.  I’ve never seen anything before like what I saw last night.  If it was ONE object, it must have been HUGE.  That said and given the relative distance between the flashing lights, it appeared that it MUST have been two objects, whatever they were.Whatever it was, it was flying, it wasn’t making a sound and I could not identify it, which I guess technically makes it a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1428,"five plus objects with blinking lights like planes, but moving soundlessly and in all four directions (not linear)I walked outside to smoke a cigarette in my backyard around 11:30pm.  I’ve been looking for ufos my whole life, but have never actually seen one.  My grandfather was a ufo “quack” and said he’d seen a few, and told me you can identify them by their movements, because they can move laterally, unlike a plane, and up and down as well.  These objects were beyond the brush of trees separating my yard from our neighbor’s yard, and I thought initially they were just extraordinarily bright stars, though I wondered why there were three of them (at first) in a unique formation.I noticed those first, and kept smoking my cigarette, then saw what I thought was a plane or two fly across the sky overhead.  I had never anticipated ufos having flashing lights similar to those of planes (that’s how I know that what I see when I occasionally observe the sky thinking to chance to see a ufo—mostly out of nostalgia for my grandfather, though I do find the subject interesting—are just planes).  I heard the sound of a plane passing by, but since the sound is delayed from that distance, I didn’t know which objects were emitting the noise.  I followed the objects across the sky, and they went in the general direction of the other objects, but didn’t “meet up” with the others, as I half expected them to.  At this point I still thought the two I’d seen overhead (not in the sky across my neighbor’s yard) were planes, but then I saw a passenger plane with its lights on fly straight (and only straight) across the sky, and pinned the noise on that.I kept watching to see if once the nearest plane passed, the delayed sound of its flight would remain as I scanned the other objects, but it didn’t.  When I looked back at the sky across my neighbor’s yard, these two objects—two flashing lights (red and white, I believe) at each end, it seemed—were flying slowly and soundlessly in an ascending pattern, then dipping again.  I wondered if they were drones (flying illegally), because maybe drones make less noise than planes, but counting them all together, at different points in the sky, I believe I saw about six, so I didn’t know what to make of it.  I thought also they might be helicopters, for a fire nearby or something, but they seemed close enough to emit some noise (like a helicopter would, I think), and emitted none.The objects (speaking of these last two primarily) seemed also to appear slightly larger and smaller at various points, as if they were also not just moving laterally and up or down, but also ever so slightly (from my visual perspective) in my direction and then back again.  At this point there were two objects left, and I made out (I think) the shape of the one to the right.  It was hard to know the shape of the others, but they all seemed to have blinking lights (again, unexpected), but between the blinking red and white lights at each end of the one I could see, there seemed to be a cigar-shaped body to the object.  These two objects made their way up, and then slightly down, moving to the left of my vision at a slow but steady pace all the while, and they seemed to concentrate themselves (this is in general of most of the objects I saw, but these two as well) into a bright single point of light occasionally, something resembling like a lightning bug or a fairy in a disney m! ovie.I got in my car and drove down the street to the martinsville part of the mountain (I live on the mountain section of warren nearby), trying to trace the lights, and drove around for about a half an hour looking for them, but came back without successfully tracking one.  When I got back to my house there were no objects left in the sky anywhere around.I’m a grad student in english lit at montclair state university.  I live with my cousin and a friend of ours.

1434,"5 large lights hovered above Ogden, Utah, before disappearing one by one.So at this time of year in Eden, it's still light outside, but the sun has gone under the mountains, so it's brightest around the rims of the mountains and fades darker as it gets further from the sun.

It was then that I noticed a strange formation of lights to the right of the plane.There were 5 lights, each one about a half of the size of the plane.  They were in a slightly curved formation.  Three of them were in a straight line, and there were two slightly lower than the others on either side of the three. It was so large I feel like it spanned about a mile, because it hovered over an entire mountain peak.  Each dot was completely unmoving.  The color of each dot was indescribable, and I'd never seen the color before.  At a glance it was white with a reddish hue, but then it was also blue or purple if you looked again.  It was as if it was all of those colors at once.Within a minute of me spotting it, it started disappearing one light by one, before it was gone completely.I'm not sure if it was a single craft or 5, because it was only seen as multiple lights.

It should also be noted that during the time I watched this spectacle, it weaved in and out of contrail clouds before finally disappearing from view behind the group of mountains.

There were no associated blinking or colored lights as on an aircraft.The lights were brighter and more focused than stars, and were flying at an altitude far lower than high planes yet higher than any low planes.  The lights moved straight ahead with no side to side movement, and traveled too fast to be a high altitude plane or a satellite, but slower than a low altitude plane.The lights were in a straight line formation too far apart to be just a single plane.  Although no associated shape was detected, it seemed as if the lights were positioned with one at the front and one at the back.What was so startling and attention-getting was that the direction of travel was entirely not in keeping with the normal flight paths of either ELP or Biggs Army Airfield, nor of the high altitude commercial flight paths crossing El Paso.  The witness is a nightly observer of the constellations and the local commercial and Army flight paths across Northeast El Paso.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: El Paso, TX",Occurred : 4/5/2016 19:55  (Entered as : 04/05/16 19:55),Posted: 4/15/2016,Reported: 4/12/2016 4:47:11 PM 16:47,Shape: Light

I expected the light to either fade out or explode into a star-burst.  Much to my surprise, this light was moving steadily from south to north.  Aside from being obscured by cloud cover a couple times the bright red did not fade, nor did it change speed nor direction.  Because of its speed and altitude I thought it could be a plane, but I looked carefully and could not see any flashers, like a small plane would have.

As we got closer, could see head on, two bright “headlights” with two small blinking lights, one on either side.We drove underneath it, and then I realized it was either moving very slow or not at all.  From underneath, could see the light, almost grayish, color of the triangle against a clear dark sky.  In the triangle were 3 larger lights on the points, and a series of many smaller lights forming an inner diamond.  Outside of the colored portion where you could only see black sky, were the blinking lights, one on each side, one red, one green.The driver of the car thought me crazy, and didn’t want to look at it.  So we kept the same speed, drove head on, underneath, then away, in about the course of a mile or less, with me watching it the entire time.

1464,"Flashes of light outside tent, mechanical whirring noises, and extreme effect of heart rate of witnesses.My two best friends and I (and my friend's six year old son) went winter camping in our usual spot at Handcart Campground in Pike National Forest two nights ago.  I will call my friends B & C for sake of anonymity.  B & C and I stayed up until about ten p.m. watching the campfire while B's son had gone to bed in the giant tent we were all sharing. We were drinking a few beers and passing around a whiskey flask, but none of us were drunk...not by a longshot.  The sky was absolutely clear with probably the best view of the stars I've ever seen.  The three of us put out the fire, climbed into the tent, and went to bed.  The wind really picked up shortly after we went to bed. I had a lot of trouble falling asleep, much more than usual when I'm in the woods, but I did eventually doze off.  I'm an experienced camper and not generally afraid of the wilderness, but I had a feeling of unease in my gut. It was odd but I chalked it up to the solitude of being at high elevati! on in the off-season, in an area four miles from the nearest houses and up a road we had to do a lot of rugged four-wheeling to get to.Around eleven thirty I woke up and had to urinate.  My phone said it was 11:30 p.m.  I still felt uneasy, just something in the air, I guess, so I threw on my boots and took my 10mm pistol with me.  It was very cold so I made it quick.  I got out of the tent, did my business, looked around for a moment and climbed back inside.  Something did not feel right out there. Words cannot describe it, but I was not at ease.  Also, the wind was incredibly loud, which made falling back to sleep impossible.  I lay there, restless, for about an hour, until the event happened.An especially brutal blast of wind hit the tent and the rainfly battered the top of the structure.  That's what made me open my eyes. And that was when I witnessed what appeared to be camera flashes going off just above our tent.  Just as the wind hit its peak velocity, those lights went off at the same time and lasted for about seven to ten seconds, covering a specific side of the dome's top in an area visible to me of about three feet by two feet.  At first, I thought it was lightning accompanying the wind, but I knew there were no (and I mean zero) clouds in the sky that night. I blinked a few times and whispered to my friend C, who was sleeping beside me.  There was a muffled response and I asked him if he'd seen that light. I said I thought it might be lightning.  There was no further response and I didn't believe anyone else in the tent had either witnessed the lights or even been awake to see them  (In the morning I found this was not the case.)  For the next ten minutes I s! tared at the roof of the tent, watching, terrified. My heart was racing, and try as I did, I could NOT get it to slow down. I exercise regularly and my heart rate was so fast it felt as if I'd just gotten done with a three-mile run.  And it would not slow down. I tried to close my eyes and will it to slow, but it was impossible.  I am not an overreacting kind of person but I was fairly certain I was at risk of having a heart attack as I lay there.  My left arm even tingled off and on.  I remember checking the clock on my phone but I cannot recall now what time it read. As the wind battered the tent I heard my buddies shuffle in their sleeping bags and I tried to talk to them again, but again I got no response.  So I dug out my hip flask and took a few swigs of whiskey, trying desperately to calm my nerves.  It was then I remembered the earplugs that were still in my coat pocket from when we'd gone out down the hillside to shoot rifles earlier that day. I dug them out and put them! in my ears to block the sound of the wind and the tent skin f! lapping against itself. Then I could really hear my heart and it scared the hell out of me. At that point, I closed my eyes and tried to breathe as slow and deep as I could. I felt like I was calming, but my pulse still raced and I was wide awake. After what I can only guess was about fifteen minutes since the first pulse of light, another giant blast of wind caught the tent, the worst of the whole night, and I opened my eyes again to see another round of lights, this time green and situated at the opposite side of the tent's top, flashing like paparazzi cameras for about five seconds. It was absolutely terrifying and I didn't know what to think. After that I called out to my friends, not in a whisper, and again I received no response. I could make out their forms in the dark tent so I knew they were there but they didn't respond. I gripped my pistol inside my sleeping bag and felt my shotgun resting right beside the bag. But neither of them brought me comfort.After that second round of lights, the wind died down some. Not completely, but a fair amount. My heart still pounded and I put the foam earplugs back in, trying to drive out all other input but my own thoughts. I don't know how long I lay there, but it felt like probably an hour passed as I tried, unsuccessfully to calm my pulse.  The next thing I knew I was waking up to early morning light.  I had managed to fall asleep at some point and was eternally grateful to see the sunlight playing at the edges of our tent through the trees.My friends all woke up relatively soon after that, and I asked them was if they'd seen the lights. My friend B's face said everything.  And the first thing he said was he thought he was going to have a heart attack.  He repeated an experience that was identical to mine above, including the inability to slow his heart and having pain in his left shoulder associated with it until he finally passed out.  The exception to his story being he also heard a series of shrill mechanical beeps just before the second round of lights (something I decided I must have missed due to the earplugs).  He also said he heard me ask about lightning after the first flashes but never heard anything else from me, possibly because of the noise of the wind.  Our friend C did not witness any of the lights or sounds but said he did not sleep well at all, partly because of the wind, but also partly because he didn't feel right.  The child slept fine and didn't wake up once, despite the wind.We made it back down the mountain and home yesterday morning. We didn't even stick around to make breakfast, which we traditionally always do.

Just before I past the navasota livestock auctionhouse, I noticed a flash in the sky.  It was quick.  At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but then I saw one again in a different area.  I asked my friend if he saw them and he said no.  After a few seconds though, I was able to get him to see what I was seeing.  It was a small white light.  It was as if someone from up high in a mountain was signaling down with a mirror, but there was nothing but bright blue clear sky behind it.  The light would last less than 10 seconds and disappear, then reappear in another spot in the same general area.  They never reappeared in the same spot twice. Sometimes, I felt like I could kinda start to make out something physical attached to the light, but as soon as my eyes would adjust to what I was looking at,  It would blink off again.  It was too! far away for me to make out any details other than the light.

It moved in a straight line at a steady pace.As it cleared the clouds i saw that it was not a bird, but a white triangle with no noticable lights.  it looked slightly blurry,solid white.I was still convinced it was probably a large bird like maybe a giant crane and that i just couldnt see its wings move and that why it looked triangular.I watched it travel westward until it did an amazing series of loops and zigzags at an incredible speed, then it took off northwest over the archer road area so fast that it virtually disappeared out of eye sight.  it moved so fast it seemed like it left a tracer or trail of itself for a split second.

1496,"White oval light in night sky then vanishes in Reardan WA.April 1st around 9:00pm, my sister and I were driving on Highway 2, going west from Spokane, WA.  We reached the small town of Reardan, WA, and we were nearing Cedar Street on Highway 2, when we both noticed a white orb above, move or wobble across the night sky.  Reardan Grain Growers Elevators are located straight ahead of us on the right of Highway 2 and we were about 4 city blocks east of the elevators.  The white orb wobbled and seemed almost even with the silhouette of the elevators.  Then shot directly straight down and disappeared.  Startled at what we saw, we took a right and drove around the elevators near the railroad tracks and saw nor heard anything.  When we went back onto Highway 2 to continue west, we saw several cars pulled over on the side of the road.  The driver was talking to the other driver.  We wished we had pulled over and asked if they had seen what we saw but we were in such confusion that it was hard to wrap our brain around it.What was most unusual about this experience was the size of the white orb, how close it was to us, how fast it moved straight down and how silent the whole experience was.  If my sister had not seen the same thing I would probably have denied myself believing what I had seen.(NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to NUFORC, and we hold her in very high regard.

1497,"Multiple sightings of bright white orbs that sometimes flashed brightly.At roughly 8:55pm, Friday, April 1st, 2016, I was standing in my backyard looking up at Polaris to the north and Orion to the S/SW, admiring the clear sky and beautiful weather of the evening.  Suddenly, I noticed a very bright and solid light originating from just to the right of the star Saiph, in the Orion constellation.  The direction of travel was S/SW to N/NE. It was travelling quickly enough to be thought of as a low flying plane, only there were no position or navigation lights or even a strobe light to be seen.  Just a perfectly solid bright white light that did not change in shape or luminosity as it changed its position in the sky.  There was no sound at all.Quite surprisingly, it looked as if the light was drifting ever so slightly to the east, in the same way a gliding bird might be moved by wind currents.  This took the object directly above me.  There it slightly paused for about 1 second as it changed direction and moved in a very straight line directly to the East.  I called my wife and we both watched the light, which continued to make no sound and show no other lighting other than the constant bright white light, until it got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance.About 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard with my Sony A7000 fitted with a 55-210 zoom lens, set to maximum zoom.  Within one minute I saw a faint object flying directly South to North, exactly from where the original sighting began by Orion.  I recorded video as I watched the dim object suddenly grow in brightness (and apparent size, but hard to know if this was just a function the increased glow).  The object was constantly in and out of focus, as the Autofocus struggled to keep up.Again, about 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard…this time with the camera set to manual infinity focus…and I saw a small faint object moving from the North/Northeast toward the Southeast.  I started recording and called my wife to come back out.  I had no tripod with me.  The object all but disappeared and had been blindly pointing the camera, by hand, at the blank sky where I had roughly last seen it…when suddenly, it flashed in brightness and we could see it rapidly “expand” and “contract” after each flash.  Most flashes were very bright, but others were more subtle and undulating.  This did not last long. Perhaps one minute.  This last sighting occurred in the same portion of sky that the initial object had disappeared in to.  I continued to watch and record the sky, but it never flashed again, and I saw no other objects in any other portion of the sky.I have video of the last two sightings.  The last sighting is the best quality due to the manual infinity focus, but they both lacked a tripod so it is unfortunately very shaky.",Duration:30 minutes,"Location: Portland, OR",Occurred : 4/1/2016 20:55  (Entered as : 04/01/16 20:55),Posted: 4/15/2016,Reported: 4/1/2016 11:24:05 PM 23:24,Shape: Light

1509,"Have seen multiple UFOs over the course of the past 6 months, orbs of light, one included 2 military planes that seemed to be following.I heard your interview on the ""Podcast UFO"" show and you mentioned your belief that only 1 in 20,000 people who do see a UFO will report it - and I realized I was one of the 19,999 who has seen them on multiple occasions but never reported it to anyone (because I figure anyone who looks into the subject will find out that they're real, and anyone who won't look into it will not be benefited by my report anyway!).  I appreciate your work, so I thought I should be the ""1 in 20,000"" who reports what they saw instead.I'm an amateur astronomer, and one night I was outside on my back porch trying to determine whether or not I should bring my telescope out that night, looking casually at the sky and weather conditions.  It was mostly clear, with a few clouds far to my east.  Suddenly, I noticed a brightly lit glowing object out of the corner of my eye above me.  I thought to myself something along the lines of ""what planet is this?  How have I not seen this planet before?"" - thinking I had just been ""missing"" this planet or star because it was hidden behind a tree from the perspective of my porch.Then it started moving, and then it started making a turn over my general area and I knew at once this was no normal astronomical object.  This object was at least 3x brighter and larger than Jupiter and what it looked like was a pearl-shaped ball of light, or at first it just appeared like a very bright orb of light.  It was moving very fast (compared to conventional things like ""drones"", passenger jets, or Chinese lanterns) - but not as fast as a shooting star.  It made a strangely sharp turn in the sky and then moved silently over my area eastward, out toward rural land near Alden, NY. -- interesting to note that when I checked your website or MUFON's I found it has reports of flying discs/UFOs from that same town).At first it was simply a large point of light, brighter than the planet Jupiter and all the stars (which weren't out yet that night) - its brightness/light quality/size did not change at all regardless of what perspective I was looking at it from (""head on"", in front of it, behind it after it passed over me, from far away, etc) and there were no blinking lights. I see airplanes every night I observe the sky, I'm perfectly familiar with what they look like and I would be able to discern them even at night.  This was no airplane, it didn't blink at all. I thought to myself I should really get my cell phone and take video of it, but I didn't want to leave.  Eventually I made the decision that I couldn't miss the opportunity and I put my faith in the fact it would still be there when I got back, ran inside and grabbed my cell phone and some binoculars I had nearby, and came back out.It was still traveling on it's course through the sky and I tried to take video of it with my cell phone - the video turned out all black on the screen (even though it was not late enough to be an all ""black"" sky, it was more dusk) and I couldn't get my phone to find or zoom in on the object properly, so I gave up that idea and put my binoculars to my eye, this is when I saw the strangest thing.  Inside the orb of light I had been watching was a craft (or something - some type of structured object) - I can't find the right words to describe it's shape but it wasn't normal, and it was a gold colored burnished metal to my eyes.The object continued moving away from me entered some clouds and I was still able to see the light through the cloud -- then it passed out of the cloud and through some open sky, then into another, thicker cloud bank where I completely lost sight of it.I stood around outside thinking about how strange it was and hoping to see it again, wondering if more would be coming or if that was just a one-off strange experience. A few minutes later (maybe 10, not certain) 2 military jets came flying through my area lower than normal commercial planes, these 2 looked like small gray fighter jets and they were traveling quickly as a pair -- they were heading to exactly the direction and area I had last seen my UFO at. I wonder if they were sent up to intercept or look at the object after it was caught on radar somewhere. Strangely, these jets too were silent from where I stood looking at them, even though normally jets going overhead make a ton of noise from a mile away. Now over the past few months I've seen this type of thing 4 times. The one I typed up above was the most interesting because it included military jets pursuing the UFO, but I've seen similarly strange things like this in the sky. One time I was out for a walk with a family member and they pointed out a particular bright object in the night sky and asked me which planet it was, ""is that Jupiter?"", etc. I noticed it immediately and thought to myself ""huh, what is Jupiter doing over there in the wrong place?"" -- then it started moving! It moved through the sky steadily, then for some reason it ""disappeared into"" another star in the night sky - as if it had decided to jump into ""hyperspace"" at that point or turn off it's light. In the weeks following I saw the same thing again with the same family member, only this time it just traveled through the sky at high altitude. Again the strange thing was the quality of light, no blinking FAA beacons, no change in brightness based on perspective, and it seemed higher than normal airplane altitudes. It just traveled over my area and I was able to watch it until it disappeared from my vision because of distance. These were all sort of ""spheres"" of light. My last recent experience took place while I was walking from my car into the local Rite Aid - I happened to look up at the sky (as is my habit as an amateur astronomer) and noticed an unlit, perfectly spherical ""orb"" - or just a sphere hanging there in the sky between a few clouds. It was fairly high up but I saw it clearly, I stood there looking up at it for a few minutes and it didn't move at all. It was like a greyish white color. Eventually some other customers pulled up to the store so I went in because I didn't want to look like a crazy person standing in front of Rite Aid staring  up at the sky. When I came back out the sphere that had been between the moderate cloud cover was nowhere to be found - but it's earlier position was still clear of clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1521,"Large light moving in a pendulum like motionI came outside with a friend that was visiting to smoke a cigarette and noticed what I initially though was a very bright and large star.

I called my other friend who was visiting to come outside to see what he thought of it.  After he came outside it started maneuvering back and forth from right to left for around a minute.  After the back in forth motion, it started moving back and forth again but this time descending.  The motion this time was kind of odd.

And it had a orange color to it which made it stand out even more.  When I retrieved my camera and picked up the light. Clearly like I had mentioned before the light was indeed flashing on my photo screen which made it much more clearer to notice.  Now in the photos there are 2 lights you will see in the center of the screen.  The lower one being almost center with the other light just above it and to the right a bit.  The lower light you see is actually some piece of the roof top that is to the north of us which you see in the photo as well.  So the light that is above the one I just mentioned is the one that has me stuck on stupid. The photos were taken one after another.

1541,"unusually bright aircraft-like light that suddenly dimmedAs I was returning to the house after walking the dog, I noticed a light which I assumed was an airplane traveling overhead.  It was moving from the SW to the NE at a speed and altitude I normally associate with our usual air traffic.  Nevertheless, something seemed odd about it although I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what that was.  I let the dog in, grabbed binoculars, and crossed through the house to the backyard.  I easily picked up the object on the same trajectory, which made me think again that it was an airplane.  However, when I looked with binoculars I could not make out the body of an aircraft or any blinking lights.  I could only see a very bright, bluish-white light with a smaller, dimmer, reddish light on the upper right side/edge of the bright light.  The bluish-white light appeared circular, with the smaller red light located along the perimeter at a 1 o’clock position.  As I watched, waiting to glimpse a blinking navigation light, it seemed to me that the white light was too bright.  The intensity reminded me of the rocket that passed by here on November 7, 2015.  This light was not nearly that spectacular, but the quality of the light seemed similar (magnesium-like), if that makes any sense.  Then as I was tracking it eastward, the bluish-white light appeared to grow even brighter and more intense.  As I was puzzling about this, the bluish-white light began to rapidly dim until it extinguished, leaving only the barely visible reddish light which then also disappeared.  The entire time it had maintained a steady speed and it appeared to track at a consistent altitude and in the same (NE) direction.  The brightness followed by the rapid fading out reminded me of a flare, except that this object was traveling horizontally, was moving more slowly, and remained visible for a much longer amount of time than the maritime flares I have seen. For the same reasons, it also did not appear to be a meteor.  I scanned the skies for 10-! 15 minutes longer but never saw any additional sign of the obj! ect.  Several small aircraft did fly overhead during this time, following the more typical aircraft routes from S to N/ N to S.

1542,"Flying translucent triangle shape and transformer explosionMy daughter, girlfriend and I were walking east up the hill in Badger Prairie Park in Verona, Wisconsin, on 3/29/16.  It was a dark night with low cloud cover, and the soccer field was lit up on one side of the hill and the baseball diamond on Verona Road was lit up as well.  It was approximately 8:20-25pm or so.  The light from the baseball diamond lit up the hill behind us and cast our shadows on the hill.I suddenly noticed some dim movement up in the sky near the baseball diamond.  It looked like a triangular outline of squarish shapes that moved together in unison.  It was very difficult to make out and appeared translucent at times.  It moved across and over where we were standing and changed shape somewhat as it moved, almost appearing to be wavy like the surface of water with sunlight on it.  It looked like it was either reflecting or creating some sort of dim light, which we agreed was cream-colored.We considered what it could have been, ruled out migratory birds, but it possibly could have been a large bunch of balloons tied together in a line.  The wind was blowing fairly strongly and whatever it was was moving in the direction of the wind.  The shapes suddenly disappeared, but it could have vanished into clouds, it was very difficult to see.It is possible that what we saw could have been some reflection off the clouds by the bright lights that were shining on both fields.  But what made it even more strange, after seeing that and us wondering what it could be, was that maybe 45 seconds later an enormous explosion occurred on Verona Avenue, lighting up the entire sky.  It was obviously a transformer – sounded like one and lit up the sky like one, and I have seen two others – and it wiped the power out on both fields and much of the city (when we got back our power had been out as well).  Fire and rescue responded, which we got to see from the height of the hill.I just looked up the Fire Department site, and they reported two incidents 3 minutes apart that are documented in the links below in their online reports.  These would have been within the path of the flying thing, judging by the trajectory that it was going when we saw it.  We could also see the sirens that responded to the “alarms” from where we were standing.http://www.veronafire.com/incidents/detail/334598http://www.veronafire.com/incidents/detail/334599 In general, the way this shape moved and looked in the light, which was very unnatural looking and not like anything we had seen before, as well as the timing of the exploding transformer, my gf and I both thought that this merited us reporting it.",Duration:30 seconds,"Location: Verona, WI",Occurred : 3/29/2016 20:25  (Entered as : 3/29/16 20:25),Posted: 4/1/2016,Reported: 3/30/2016 7:58:50 PM 19:58,Shape: Triangle

As I closed the mailbox,a bright pulsating orange light just above the tree line caught my eye.  It was moving very slowly to the southeast with no sound.  The object intensified in brightness and then faded somewhat as it traveled in a straight line to the east.  It was clearly under intelligent control as it did not deviate from its flight path.  I then ran inside and grabbed my binoculars and then ran back out the back door to my back yard.  The object then disappeared and then reappeared about 20 seconds later.  I raised my binoculars and focused them in on the object and it changed from a solid orange object to a triangular shaped object with three orange lights.

1548,"5 to 7 white triangles observed flying in formation.The day was a typical post blizzard, beautiful clear, Colorado day.  I had just pulled into the driveway of my parents' home to visit.  I heard the engines of fighter jets above which drew my attention to the sky.  Now jets overhead is a daily occurrence with Buckley Air Force Base minutes away.  I have become a custom to seeing things in the sky having grown up in Aurora, by the AFB.  At the age of 42, I have come to relize that as young teenager along with a neighbor friend, we witnessed a black triangle almost some 30 years ago.  I digress, back to the recent sighting.  As I was looking for the jets, I noticed a formation of about 5 to 7 white triangles moving south to north over the AFB, but at very high altitude.  To me it did not seem as though the jets were after these objects, but obviously I do not know that for sure.  I observed these triangles for about 20 to 30 seconds as they moved across the sky in formation.  In my mind, I can rule out geese or seagulls as, these objects moved in a tight formation.  One triangle that was on the left of the formation did break from the rest, drop to the rear only to rejoin the formation again on the right side.  It was not long after that I lost sight of the objects. Again, I know what birds in flock look like and this was not that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1555,"Blue-Green flash in the night sky.I was driving on Route 15 in Hamden after entering the highway from exit 60.  I was headed south west towards Orange when I saw a blue flash in the cloudy sky to my south, probably over New Haven or the Long Island Sound.  At first I assumed the flash was lightning - it was an incredibly windy night and lightning wouldn't have been out of the question - but over 1 or 2 seconds the flash turned green before lingering for another second or two, and then disappearing.  There was no discernible thunder.  The flash could have been one of many things:  environmental phenomena, a flare, a bi-product of some sort of industrial/scientific activity, a bi-product of military testing, or a UFO.  Interestingly, later that night as I was driving in Orange, there was a tree down, (from the wind), in the middle of the road.  I called the Orange PD to alert them about the tree in the road and they sent an officer out to the scene - this police officer said that she had also seen the flash in the sky.One final thing to note - there was what seemed like some sort of fire in Milford/Stratford today. The smoke could be seen and smelled from where I live in Orange.  The smoke from this fire may have weirdly filtered the light from a lightning bolt from blue to green and I may have been unable to hear the thunder because it was either too far off or my car was too noisy.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1560,"Started with 1 light on east horizon, followed it, grew to countless lights over 2 hours, along with close encounter ground sighting.It started with one light, redish/orangish/white hovering over the horizon while me and my friend were parked on my road, facing east.  I live on the east outskirts of Rochester.  It was staying in the same area but floating, dipping, and swooping around.  You could tell it was far away.  I pointed it out to ((friend's name deleted)) and she saw it too, and it proceeded to swoop around and dip up and down erratically.  We both saw it moving.  I was really excited and made her drive closer to where it was.  We drove closer, heading east until we weren't really in Rochester any longer, more Buckhart area.  I lost view of the light on the way.  When our view became clear again, we parked facing the side of the sky we saw it in, the south east whole sector of the sky.  I couldn't find it and then I noticed it in a different part of the sky, much higher.  We watched this light dance around for awhile.  It moved in ways impossible to any technology we have.  ((friend's name deleted)) saw it too.  We were watching the one light fly erratically.  Both of us keep thinking we glimpse other similar lights moving but aren't sure.  The one light is flying over the horizon at a steady speed in one direction, then it slowly fades away and seems to dissappear.  Another (or the same) light pops up much higher in a totally different direction in the sky.  Then we both saw the second one.  Same color of light, same behavior.  I was ecstatic.  At this point it was clear that these could not be planes or helicopters.  And then they kept appearing--they just kept popping up.  These different lights, all the same color, all differing moment to moment in brightness and dimness, sometimes becoming so dim as to be invisible.They all flew the same style--drunk alien, but never in sync; they would swoop, reverse directions in an instant, dip up and down.  There were no formations to be seen or apparent organization.  Sometimes the speed of their movement was shocking, given how far away they were they had to be covering huge distances in an instant.  Some would move in a general direction, but erratically.  At one point I could have sworn a fighter jet was pursuing one of them, but I couldn't be sure and ((friend's name deleted)) didn't notice it.  I tried to keep count and I got to 8 before I couldn't count them due to the number and the extreme dimness of some of them.  I kept trying to explain it to ((friend's name deleted)), but I don't think she will ever understand how much of a big deal this kind of shit is to me.  The sky was alive with dancing spaceships.We were there for maybe two hours. I could not stop watching, it was like being in a trance.  So I was watching the dance of the spaceships when I noticed a light in the sky coming from behind us (high, moving from NW to SE toward the spaceships.  It was different-- bigger, and blinking one light and one color in steady pulses, and moving at a steady speed and direction.  I assumed it's a plane but I watched it because something seemed odd about it. It's not like a light ON it is blinking, it's like the entire vessel is blinking.  And the color is like an old yellow light, like the color cast by old light bulbs.  I notice in between the blinks it appears to glow a very dull red.  It changes directions and comes in towards the ships.  I watch a spaceship closest to the incoming big yellow light and the strangest thing happens, the spaceship seems to become aware of the new interloper, and it swept towards it and back in a few motions, and then IT STARTED BLINKING BACK AT THE SHIP.  And both blinked differently, like they were shaking hands or trading information of some kind, with different rythyms and frequency and color.  This was the first time we saw any of the fireballs blink.  They blinked a bright white.  Then the big yellow ship came in closer to the other ships and slowed down to a stop were it hovered and bobbed.  As it did this, two more spaceships swooped in close to it and began their own unique blinking response.  So clearly it was another UFO, but different from the rest.  After it delivered it's message or whatever it flew away (SE to NE and seemed to go higher than any plane ever could) where it seemed to become a still star.  At this point, I couldn't take it and I called my dad to make him come outside the house and try to see what I was seeing.  This was also a really strange aspect.  Once my dad came outside, the brightest of the spaceships all started blinking red and white, like airplanes.  They also chose a general direction and stuck with! it, though their speed fluctuated.  It was funny because they all blinked with no rhythm or steady pulse to them.  Long story short, all he sees is airplanes of course.  He goes back in and I get off the phone with him and the ships go back to normal and start moving more.  At several points, I made reference points by holding up my thumb or my phone still under the light in the sky, this was an easy way to see that they were moving relative to the motionless point. I can't explain what I saw, but we saw it and it was amazing. A two hour dance that started with one little light.GROUND SIGHTING, AS WE LEAVE:  [A NOTE: we did not see any ship approach the ground or come close to landing] Right before we leave a big solid white orb light maybe a hundred yards behind us floods us with light.  I sa,y ""What the fuck was that?"" because it disappeared quickly and Kaitie said a car.  But the light hadn't come from the road.  It was directly behind us, close to a house on the other side of the road.  Then we were getting ready to pull out, and it floated out from behind the house.  My first impression was it was just someone with a light, but it was much too bright.  And it floated. It glided.  It came out from behind the house and started coming towards us.  We're talking the brightest white light you've ever seen, on the other side of the road not 70 yards away.  Then it's gone. Two seconds of darkness ... and then it comes back on-- except it's glowing blood red now, and more dim because of the duller color of the red.  There was no indication of anything producing the light. I was a little scared and we drove away, leaving the red light back there.That is the end of this report, but I feel the need to mention what happened the next night from my bedroom window. Kaitie was there again:  Over the cornfield in front of my house around 11 PM two lights hovering over the ground appeared and acted erratically.  One was bright and white, much similar to what we saw so close to us on the ground.  The other one was orange, and very odd at first appearance.  It looked to be a bright orange ball constructed of paper with a fire blazing inside of it.  It acted the most erratic in flight before both became almost entirely still.  They stayed until day started to come, and as the light of day  grew, they receded into the distance until they were tiny pinpricks, and then nothing.I have no pictures but if they come again I plan to walk up to them and try and take a picture/just get closer.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of the report, and despite his assurance that the report is accurate, we question whether it is a serious report.

1563,"Light sphere becomes hawk.March 28, around 12:30 PM I was at my dining table working on my laptop.  The room became very very dark, quite quickly, as if a large and very thick cloud was passing over.   However, the fact it became so dark, so quickly, and cast my dining room into such deep shadow, felt so unusual to me that I decided to go outside to my patio to see just how large a cloud might be passing over.  Even though it was a windy day and there were scattered white clouds in the area, a cloud capable of such a shadow just didn’t seem logical to me.  When I got outside and out from under my veranda roof, I did take note of a large cloud moving away from the sun but as the sun was still partially shrouded the cloud I couldn’t look directly at it… the sun was too bright.  The cloud was moving northeast and the sun was high and to the south.A very large red-tailed hawk attracted my attention, soaring against a clear blue background of open sky at about 1000 feet or so, and slightly to the north.  Its markings were clear and distinct, a beautiful thing to witness, so I whistled a hawk call, twice.  It turned, and I whistled the call again.  At that time a bright sphere appeared far above the soaring hawk, a point of light, bright, white…  Not bright like a star or a landing light.  But it was a point of light, very unusual… so I fixated on it.  I focused on it for around five to seven seconds, and observed it grow in size, and it didn't move much either.  Then a streak appeared to extend from the right side of this ball of light, like a flare, and I recall thinking I would describe flare as “feathery”.  All at once the white sphere seemed to flash, to expand and was gone, and then, in its place and right next the soaring hawk that had originally attracted my attention, appeared an identical hawk.  They soared in formation for a bit, criss-crossing paths, something I'd seen before, and after 20-30 seconds the original hawk turned and headed to the south/southwest.  The hawk that had just appeared turned north and I lost sight of it.I know the human eye can play tricks on the mind, and there may well be a logical and natural explanation for this sighting.  The other hawk may have been far above the first, and out of focus in an empty field of blue sky considering my eyes were moving, following the first hawk.  It is possible the second hawk decided to dive directly down to join the other and was backlit by the sun as it dove.  But for this to happen right overhead, as I was calling to the first hawk... strange.  I am not given to fantasy or wishful thinking… I was a 3000+ hour USAF pilot, and after that, an engineer for McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing.  I retired from Boeing 10 years ago.  I have a degree in Biological Sciences and am somewhat well grounded in the basic sciences including physics and chemistry.  I consider myself to be an objective observer and am quite familiar with the principles of science and experimentation.  I also am an avid observer of nature, and have been for years.  I live in the country, on an acreage, near Tucson, Arizona.Whatever I saw was remarkable, even if explainable by natural avian behaviors and the orientation of the sun.  However I will tell you that I have seen large hawks soaring at great heights before diving right down to near ground level within feet of me, and with the sun high.  The hawk in that case was a dark speck that quickly grew as it sped toward me, wings tucked.  It didn’t come out of a ball of light.So I’m wondering who else might have reported some similar experience.  A hawk coming out of a ball of light, the light flares and poof there's a hawk.  As I said, I’m not inclined to assume anything supernatural, paranormal, or other-worldly at this time, but I am willing to entertain the possibility.  I’ve encountered UFOs during my flying career and had a friend in the intelligence field who took reports from aircrews who experienced stunning and frightening encounters… so for me, it’s all on the table.",Duration:60 seconds,"Location: Tucson, AZ",Occurred : 3/28/2016 12:30  (Entered as : 03/28/16 12:30),Posted: 4/1/2016,Reported: 3/30/2016 1:48:41 PM 13:48,Shape: Light

1571,"V Shaped formation of 20 - 30 fast moving copper / orange objectsPlace of sighting: - Kyalami, Midrand (Johannesburg South Africa)  Time and date: - 21:29 CAT (JHB); 27 March 2016  Initial sighting direction: - West West South (towards Krugersdorp)  Event details:  Just before going to bed, I went outside onto the patio leading from our bedroom.  Being a clear cool autumn night, I went outside to look at the constellation of Orion (Westerly direction at around 30 Degrees elevation at the time) to see how clear it would be.  I noticed a small commercial aircraft making its way towards Lanseria airport (North Westerly direction from our house).I then looked more to the South to look in the direction of where a neighbour's dog was barking, and noticed a string of faint coppery orange orbs in the West.  These were moving in a boomerang/""loose string of pearls"" formation towards Pretoria (to the North West).  I estimated they would have been directly overhead for the residents of Krugersdorp.  At the beginning of the sighting I estimated the length of the edge of this formation was about the same as holding a 4-inch long object out at an arm's length.  The easterly edge of the boomerang immediately reminded me of the so-called ""Phoenix Lights"" --this was the first thing which went through my head when I saw them - this because the ""string"" looked straight and level relative to the horizon and looked like a picture I had once seen of that phenomena (note:  these objects in this sighting were much closer to one another and there were many more).  This was the closest the formation was to me, thereafter it became smaller as it moved north easterly towards Pretoria.The ""string"" on the Westerly side moved erratically, many simultaneously moving rapidly and overtaking one another, then dropping back.  The same movement happened on the easterly side of the formation but not to the same extent.  The shape remained a ""v"" regardless of the movements of the individual objects.  The formation was moving between the constellation of Orion and Sirius.The closest comparable motion I can think of is a flock of birds flying in a v-formation in very turbulent weather and then the speed of their movements speeded up considerably. The changing of relative positions was almost ""playful,"" but always kept the same distance between the individual objects.As they moved over, the v-shape became more pronounced and less ""flat"" - I could not count them properly but I estimate there were over 20 individual objects, those on the easterly side being marginally brighter than those in the west).  These were individual objects and not part of a single larger object.The colour was slightly darker than the orange hue of the star Betelgeuse, and luminosity around 20% of that star, on the night I called my wife to see the formation, but by the time she was outside, the formation was much fainter than when I had first seen it and was just about to disappear behind the tops of the trees in the north west and she did not see the formation.  At this time the easterly side of the formation went straight again but the westerly side continued to move erratically.  She witnessed a shooting star off to the side of where the formation was.During this time - of only around 10 to 15 seconds at most - I only took my eyes off the formation once when I tried to see if my wife was looking in the right direction.In relation to the airplane mentioned earlier, the formation was moving much faster and seemed much higher in the sky.  To put the speed in perspective, the sighting covered about 3/4 of the sky and was over in the time mentioned earlier.  This reminded me of the speed of a low flying fighter jet.  There was no sound from the formation, and I did not hear engine noise from the airplane either.  By the end of the sighting the airplane had disappeared but admittedly was not the focus of my attention.I expect the only reason why the objects were even visible was because of the position and luminosity of the rising moon - reflecting off the lower surfaces of the objects - much as the sun does off satellites in the early evening.  They did not seem to emit any light themselves - ruling out the typical Chinese Lantern misidentification.  I immediately sketched the sky and the path / formation on my smartphone (attached).I am familiar with aircraft (as we have multiple airports in the vicinity) and have been interested in airplanes and associated technology since an early age.  These objects and their speed, proximity to one another and movements do not fit any aircraft I am aware of. Their movements would have been extremely risky - if impossible - for any formation of aircraft to attempt without colliding.  The acceleration and deceleration of the objects also did not seem physically possible for a object with any weight.Please note this sighting was reported to MUFON (case: 75463) on the morning of 28th March.",Duration:10-15 seconds,"Location: Johannesburg (South Africa), ",Occurred : 3/27/2016 21:29  (Entered as : 03/27/2016 21:29),Posted: 4/15/2016,Reported: 4/2/2016 3:33:33 AM 03:33,Shape: Formation

1597,"Luminescent Egg Shaped Object in Sky on SW FlightOn March 26, 2016, my husband and I were flying on Southwest Flight 4124 departing from Sacramento, California to San Diego.  We left Sacramento at 1:50 pm to our final destination, Tucson, Arizona.I sat next to the window near the wing.  I was looking out the window to view the snow covered mountains below.  The pilot announced that we were approximately 8 miles up and flying at 39,000 feet.  It was approximately 2:25 pm, I noticed in the distance, a very long, thin, black plume of what appeared to be smoke in the relatively clear blue sky.  At first glance, I thought I was looking at black birds flying in formation.  I asked my husband to take a look and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he didn’t know.  I looked again and saw a brilliant, mirror-like chrome, egg shaped object with, seamless, smooth round edges.  It appeared close, possibly within 2500 feet of the plane but due to perspective differences it could have been much further away.  In comparison to the left wing of the plane, the object took up almost three fourths of the wing.  As it moved, the top of the egg shaped object became visible.  The top was a bright white with a luminosity similar to a ! welding arc.  The top area had an extremely bright white luminescence with what appeared to be white flames in the center portion.My husband looked at this and said he did not know what it was, but believed it was not a plane nor a rocket.  He further stated that it was way too close to the plane to be a launched rocket out of a military air base. After approximately 2 to 2.5 minutes, it then disappeared from view.No one else in the plane appeared to observe it, as many were preoccupied—with shades drawn, sleeping, reading, etc.  My husband later looked on the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) site in the incident/accident report section and found no report of such an object or a rocket launch in the vicinity of our flight path.

At that time there were three reddish orange lights in a triangular pattern.  By the time I got outside to see for myself one had disappeared.  I viewed myself as the last two disappeared.  They appeared to be hovering and not crossing the horizon.  As I watched they appeared to be pulsating irregularly.

1601,"15-20 orange spheres floating in triangular patterns in the night sky would disappear in peculiar ways, and sound was suppressed.My girlfriend and I (during our college spring break) were driving near my home in Kenmore, WA, at around 9:50 PM.  All of a sudden, we spotted strange lights overhead.  We started freaking out because of how eerie these lights looked, and we opened the doors and got out of the car several times to take pictures and look at the lights.  They were orange and very illuminated, sphere shaped, and were ""floating"" in a certain pattern in the sky.  They seemed to be clustered into triangular formations, 3 in each triangle.  All in all, around 15 lights were seen, maybe more, and no more than 7 or so lights at any given time.The lights vanished at different places, and when I say ""vanished,"" I don't mean they simply faded instantaneously.  When they would disappear, my girlfriend and I could both clearly see the back of each light when the front would vanish, almost like they were ""sucked into a portal.""  While that sounds corny, it's the only analogy I can really think of.  During the entirety of the sighting, all sound was noticeably quieter, almost as if it were being suppressed, with the exception of an odd rippling sound coming from an unknown source.  The window on the driver’s side of my 2006 Trailblazer wouldn't roll down during the sighting, and has been faulty since.  A plane was spotted flying near the lights during the middle of the event, and about a minute or two after the last light disappeared, another plane flew in the direction the lights were headed, this time at a speed faster than a plane normally flies.  All of the lights were going exactly west, towards the! Puget Sound.  The final lights were seen shortly after 10:00 PM.Throughout the encounter, both I and my girlfriend were freaking out.  My girlfriend was scared during the entirety of the sighting, and I was on edge as well.  While neither of us have any background or extensive knowledge about any types of aircraft, we both agreed we had never seen anything like it.  I have one good video taken via snapchat, and while it shows several of the lights, it doesn't even come close to what the real encounter was like.  During the video, you can see one of the lights ""accelerate"" as some of the lights would do, then disappear.",Duration:14 minutes,"Location: Kirkland/Kenmore, WA",Occurred : 3/25/2016 22:00  (Entered as : 03/25/16 22:00),Posted: 4/1/2016,Reported: 3/30/2016 3:04:49 PM 15:04,Shape: Sphere

1612,"Three flashing lights in the night sky on a horizontal line with the bottom of the moon as one light moved rapidly between.The following event occurred approx. 20 miles east of Lubbock, Texas, at around 9:30 pm CST on the evening of March 24, 2016.  Me and my friend were standing on my back porch, cooking steaks and enjoying the evening.  It was a very clear and mild night by West Texas standards.  Rising out of the east was a beautiful almost clay red moon that, in my estimation, illuminated at 97 percent visible.  My friend in awe of the natural beauty of the moon's presence in the night sky proceeded to document on his cell phone camera.The event that immediately followed was recorded on his camera.With my back to him and tending the grill, he became vocally excited about something he was witnessing in the eastern night sky as he recorded on his phone camera.  He exclaimed to me that he had just had visual on something that was amazing and though he may have captured the event on camera.  Seconds later, I walked up behind him and viewed his phone screen over his shoulder.  What he had recorded amazed me.This is what I witnessed immediately after he had stopped recording the documented footage.  To the east in a medium low horizon was the moon with what appeared at first as a bright star on a lower plane on the right side (southern side from viewed position).  Watching this, my attention became enhanced as this star seemed to be drifting horizontally in the direction of the moon.  At this point what appeared to be a smaller star ejected out of the larger original star and moved rapidly across the lower horizontal plane of the moon.The fast moving light moved across the field of view of the camera and disappeared.  After viewing again we noticed a faint flashing light on the north side of the moon in which the fast moving object appeared to be heading in the direction of.  The lights came close to each other but the traveler passed by the faint object’s lower side.I immediately viewed the event he captured on his cell phone and experienced his excitement as it occurred in real time.  The phone these images were captured on was a Motorola E Android 4.4.4 .  Also, the video is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise after downloaded.  Meaning the movement of objects actually is from right to left horizontally or from south to north from our view point.Afterwards he noticed his cell phone camera was displaying some anomalous time date information on his phone settings.

The dogs were scared and wanted back in the house quickly.  I thought at first it was a helicopter but then realized that there were no running lights and absolutely no noise.  I called for my husband to come see it.  As it passed overhead to the northeast, it eventually got smaller until it was gone.  It wasn’t but a few moments before two more started over the ridge one by one.  Hubby got his camera and took photos of the spheres.  As they disappeared into the northwest night sky, another would appear over the ridge.  We witnessed 9 of these red-orange spheres in total within 15-20 minutes; each one of them moving at different speeds, in slightly different trajectories, and their red-orange color would change as they flew overhead.  We tried to come up with logical sources, like Chinese lanterns or emergency flares, but upon closer inspection of the photos it was clear that they couldn’t have been either of those things.  Hubby also took photos of the aircraft in the night sky and the spheres looked very different. The camera batteries were drained but the camera continued working.*We will email photos.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she reports that the prevailing wind, at the time of the sighting, was from the west-northwest.

We could tell they weren't stars because they were so much lower and brighter than anything we've ever seen.  We drove approximately 2-3 miles before stopping to observe.There were numerous helicopters in the sky.  The helicopters were not using much light, if any at all, so they were difficult to detect, but there were approximately 20 of them.  We videotaped the entire time but mainly focused on these three bright lights and these helicopters because we weren't sure what was happening.  Just before the three bright lights disappeared, my son thought he saw a lightning because he said everything turned white for a split second.  I did not notice this, however, in the video just as my son was saying that he thought he saw lightning, our video camera went white and our sound got knocked out.  At this point you can tell we are still videotaping the sky because the stream of tape shows that it's black, but yet when you watch the video, it's pure white with no sound.Once we arrived home, still unsure about what was going on, we quickly watched the videos.  We noticed in the videos that there were many objects that we had not seen before.  It seems like every time we watch the videos we would see more incredible things.  At this point, we realized that we were surrounded by UFOs.In the videos and I don't like can you see numerous floating objects, you can also see what appears to be the bottom of a very large ship hovering just above us.This was the most incredible thing I have ever witnessed and I am happy to share videos and pictures.I will attach a link to a video here.

Next if you look at the highest street light on the screen, you will notice that there objects moving around the light.

On each side of the craft there were lights a red one and a green on. In the middle it appeared to have the white light.  None of the lights were blinking but steady.  There was no noise, which I could hear, coming from the object.As I passed the hospital I saw the object continuing to fly in circles.

1629,"6 ""Strobing"" Lights in Formation + 2 Large Orbs + 1 Slow-moving Red Light.  Wow!I stepped out onto my second-floor porch, facing 260 degrees West, at approximately 10:20 p.m. ET.  Just to my right, I noticed 6 small, but bright lights, like “strobes”, the brightness of LED-type white lights.  They were lined up one behind the other, not in a straight line, but in a broken pattern, still flashing quickly.  I assume this was due to deviation in altitude or alignment on one side or the other.  If you picture a straight line, then they would look like one above, one below, etc.  They were not in a tight formation.  There was some distance between them.  I would estimate that they were no more than a quarter mile in front of me and an approximate altitude of 2,500 feet, give or take.  (This is a little harder for me to establish.)  They were moving from North to South, at a steady pace.  After observing for about 20 seconds, and questioning myself as to what they were, I opened the door and called for my friend to come outside.  He came straight out and the last two were just to my left, and no longer right in front of me.  All told, about 45 seconds.  We watched them continue about 177-180 degrees South, toward the beach.  It is about a .2-mile walk to the water‘s edge.  (This island, the next to last on the southern NC coast is no more than one-half mile wide at any point, and actually runs East-West.  It is less than 20 miles above the NC/SC state line and probably less, as the crow flies.)  We watched them until they could no longer be seen from our vantage point.  The street is lined with two and three-story houses on both sides and some with palms out front.  I must add that the western atmosphere was completely clear, no clouds whatsoever.  There is a street light outside, and, although the artificial lights do not allow the beauty of all the evening stars, it did not interfere with what we observed.  It was about 63 degrees and the wind was approximately 10 mph, S to N/NW. We then went through the house to the back porch, facing East, but turning our attention South.  My friend went down the back staircase to the seawall and stood about 35 feet away  from where I was standing on the steps.  Within a minute we began to see the lights again, as they were now moving West to East.  We did not have a great vantage point though, as they were emerging from behind rooftops and there was a slight cloud cover looking South.  Now their appearance was in a “soup”.  However, we continued to watch and in another minute or two, there appeared a large and somewhat muted yellow-orange orb or light, I expect due to the cloud cover.  This was at approximately 160 degrees South and high above the rooftops.  It wasn’t completely round…almost like a fat tear-drop…lighter, pale yellow, at the top and more of a light orange around the bottom.  It was illuminated for about 2 - 2.5 seconds.  In about 5 - 7 seconds, another one appeared to the right, but was somewh! at smaller, and appeared for about 2 seconds. About 30 seconds later, my friend could see only 3 of the lights, now moving West, still in formation.  The houses along the beach blocked his view.  He then walked through the yard to the front and stood in the street.  Still, the houses blocked his view.  He stated that they were at a lower altitude.  I continued to watch toward the South, but nothing.  However, within about 3-4 minutes, a red light appeared from that area (about 140 degrees SE), from behind the cloud cover, and turned Southeast to North.  It was at a higher altitude, and farther away.  It was traveling very slow.  I could not detect any other color than red.  My friend had come back through the house to the back and I pointed out the red light that had appeared.  I watched it off-and-on for at least 6-8 minutes.  Nothing else happened.  It was still traveling on a northern path when I came inside about 10:45 - 10:50 p.m. ET.  At that point the red light was at about 30 degrees North.

1645,"Entity seen at 5:00 am we were awoken by our 7 month old son crying, we heard this on the baby monitor in our room.As normal we got up to check on him, me to grab him and console him, my future wife to prep a bottle for him.  I picked him up and as leaving the nursery, I looked down the stairs to my right, through the garage window, and saw a tall slender thin black entity, I know I saw it and as I looked at it it darted inhumanly quick, out of sight.I went to the room with our son, my common-law partner had the bottle ready, i tried to get one of the 5 dogs to leave the room with me.  3 are ours 2 german shepherds, one chocolate lab, plus the two that we are watching of my mother's.  the dogs were to scared to leave the room which is unheard of.  One of my mother's dogs also a german shepherd left the room with me the others with any amount of coaxing would not move, as soon as we left the room, the shepherd tucked its tail between its legs, and booked to the piano in the living room which it stayed under and trembled.I would dismiss this as my mind playing tricks on me, however when I was 19 years of age, and I am 36 now I had an experience with a tall slender black, that has haunted me ever since.  I dont talk about it as people are quick to judge and wont believe.  I used to work then in Saskatoon, Canada,  I worked at Wal-Mart of all places, and i worked in receiving, i also worked at a popular bar/restaurant.Needless to say, I worked a shift in the city untill midnight at Wal-Mart.  The store was 4 city blocks from the residence at which i was staying.  If you have ever worked there you punch your social security number into a computer at the back of the store, this starts your shift.  I punched out after shift and was walking home, it was dark in the city but with the lights u could see very well.  I walked south 2 blocks down to Mckercher and 8th street, where there was a macs store, and rogers video rental store at the time.  I took a shortcut through the parking lot, directly in front of the macs store, as i reached the sidewalk again by the Macs store, strangely i noticed an eery abscence of light, took two steps and heard a metallic sound as i walked, i looked around feeling stranger and noticed the city lights were gone, i could not see the store there was only blackness.  I then heard a metallic cling twice from behind me coneing from the ground, i spun around wuickly to see an alien grey in colour with a triangular face, and black eyes.  I was not panicked for some reason and said hi.  The alien quickly shot out its arm and touched me with a finger on my chest, I was not scared untill this point, as the finger touched me there was an electric like charge i could feel.  This charge paralyzed me and i felt forced fear.  Every nerve ending in my body reverberated with this schock, and the fear I felt did not come from me but felt forced, and it was 1000 times worse than any i had ever felt.  The fear was at such a level that my heart pained instantly, and i had to focus quickly and steadily at slowing my pulse as i didn't think my heart would be capable of sustaining my life otherwise.  The next thing i knew i woke up on a metalic rectangular table, with 6 seven to eight foot tall thin tall black beings standing around me, Dear god one had its hand inside of me, it felt like it was tearing me apart, the pain i remember, and the forced fear still ther! e, still paralyzed, trying desperatlely to move. The entity to! wering a bove me went through my entire body it felt tearing me apart and putting me back together again, unimagineable pain. I blacked out.  The next thing i knew, i wake up its all black and im on a metallic floor, i hear clinging on the floor. i see 4 of these tall black entitys they begin kicking me, hurting me more. I try to move im still paralyzed, the fear so severe it runs through every nerve ending in my body, its forced i can't fight it, almost electrical.  I feel im going to die here, I dont want to die here no dear god no. I begin to grow angry as i get beat, i look in my mind and struggle with all I have trying to move to be able to do anything, I force a little bit of movement, i move an arm, my body still not cooperateing it takes everything i have but damn it im dying here fighting, i swing the rest of me unable to move and i hit one of the entitys, then the fear even stronger the paralysis even strobger my body goes limp, trapped in my body scared and unable to move i b! lack out.The only thing i remember next is wakeing up in bed at home, trembling and convulseing uncintrollaby, still paralyzed still the forced fear. I try to move I cant. My heart the pain its unbearable, my heart feels its about to explode, my body feels like its viberateing from my heart beating so fast. I focus with all I have I dont want to die, I try to calm my heart slow it down, it works, I try to move it feels like for 4 hours maybie only feel god only knows im still paralyzed, still that damned fear. finally i break free.

I thought I had a nightmare, I tell myself a dream. Not so lucky I check the comp at work it shows i was there. No one at work remebers me being there, they tell me i missed my shifts.

1650,"UFO looked like Venus bright white light holding postion in dusk sky, as planes came in veiw UFO cloaked out.March 20th 7:30 to 7:45 I was on my phone talking with my girlfriend driving due west down joy rd in Wayne county, Mi.  The sky was clear, pink and blue as the sun set. I made a comment to her on what I thought was Venus ((sic.  Jupiter)) making an appearance in the evening sky.  I thought it odd for it should be in the East.  The UFO was 45 degrees 55 degrees off the horizon due West and holding still. I made a mental note of 2 aircraft.The 1st a passenger jet flying due east at high elevation (Contrail) full visibility less than 100 miles out and closing fast with UFO off  its South/East at the 1st  planes 2 o’clock and at a lower ceiling.(UFO). Pilots had to see it.2nd passenger jet was flying due North West at lower altitude full visibility of it in forefront climbing and closing in at 30 miles out.  UFO would be maybe 80 miles due North/West of 2nd plane at a slight elevation to 2nd plane 10’oclock.  Pilots had to see it.So as stated the UFO looked like VENUS bright and clear light.  But when it dimmed which at first I thought maybe a light skim of cloud pass through it, I noticed it “Twinkling”  the light it look as if it was rotating left to right. It grew bright again and then I thought Venus does “Not Twinkle” like a star.  All the time I was giving play by play to my girlfriend on the phone.

It did not fly off it just went it to Cloaking mode.My original Face Book post 20 March at 20:08  Okay I thought I would share this with you all about 20 minutes ago I was driving due West and noticed a bright shiny light that I thought was Venus in the Western sky it kind of faded out and then got bright again.

1651,"Two white cigar shaped UFO's stop and hover over I-25 in Denver, then change to an amber color and disappear.My wife and I were driving northbound on I-25 from Colorado Springs to Denver.  The sighting happened somewhere between CO 470 and Yale Avenue.  We had seen several commercial aircraft flying at low altitudes over the interstate coming from DIA before the sighting.  We then saw two flat, white discs or cigar shaped objects.  We were looking at them edge on, they were definitely not saucer or dome shaped.  The objects were moving at approximately the same altitude and speed relative to the other commercial airliners.The two objects caught our attention because they seemed to move similar to the aircraft previously seen, but didn't have wings and appeared at least twice the size of the commercial airliners.  In comparison with the Sun, they would have fit almost perfectly into the radius of the Sun's circle, with perhaps some overlap for the object closest to us (further south).  They looked like thin, bring white lines across the deep blue sky.  Today was a beautiful sunny day, so their bright white color against the deep blue back drop was very easily seen.I estimated they were a good 5 to 10 miles ahead of us, looking due North.  Of course, I'm not a good judge of aerial distances, but I use the other commercial aircraft in the area as my point of reference for this estimation.  One of the objects was obviously closer to us (further south) while the second appeared smaller and seemed to be few miles further North than the first object closest to us.  They appeared to move from an E to a NW direction, similar to the commercial aircraft coming out of DIA over downtown Denver headed west over the mountains.  Then, they suddenly stopped over I-25 or perhaps just west of I-25.  At this point we were looking at them NNW of our viewpoint on I-25N.  The two objects then hovered for about 30 seconds max (possibly less) and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof!  They disappeared!  This all happened in less than a minute and we were traveling at 80 mph.  So unfortunately, we didn't get a photo or video of the event.  However, it did shake up my wife and was very unsettling to her.  She has not been one to believe in UFO's and when I tried to talk to her about it afterward, she was very uncomfortable and didn't want to discuss it.  I know what I saw and this was something very ""unidentifiable.""  If anyone else on I-25 at this same time headed northbound along side us looked up in the sky to the North-Northwest, they would have seen the same thing.

As I hit the sidewalk and began walking West, I looked up at the sky and saw several distinct points of light - which looked much like stars against the clear blue sky background.  These points of light formed a large square.  I viewed this with both the naked eye, and with my polarized sunglasses.  I quickly ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars, but by the time I returned - a minute or so later - nothing was there to be seen.  I put away the binoculars and began my walk.  A short distance down the street, I saw a single, bright point of light in the same area of the sky.  This remained stationary until approximately 11:30 am, and I have not seen anything else as of the time of this report.  I am mainly reporting this because I really hope to hear that someone else around the Cincinnati Tri-State witnessed the event.

I live next to a nature trail, and next to that is a large open field followed by an active gravel bank. It was around 4am, maybe just before.  I looked off my second story deck and I see a solid red light gliding just below the tree line, at the edge of the forest in the clearing next to the nature trail.  Maybe 50 yards away?  It appeared to be very large and dark, judging by the way it blocked my sight of its surrounding.  It was silent, almost like it was blocking the background noise in its direction.  I hit my boyfriend who was standing next to me and brought it to his attention.  He never admits to seeing anything strange but said he could not explain what he just saw and wanted to go inside.

1673,"Triangular shape object flying overhead maybe 50 feet was seen.While attending a LDS/Mormon Easter Pageant last Friday evening at the Mesa Temple in Mesa, AZ... approximately 20mins after 8pm, while there was a break in the play.  Just for a second in relaxing while I was looking up to the stars, noticing a half-faced moon (facing south-west) I noticed during the event/show there were airplane learjets flying from south to north-western pattern which would fly directly over my head say every 50 secs.  This was a bother at times when I'm trying to enjoy the show as these jets were only a few hundred feet above me.  So as I looked up one time I noticed a triangular shaped craft as I took aim with my eyes for a closer examination.  I noticed there was at least 2 circular shapes within this triangle... it was not lit up internally but the shape of this was illuminated from the street lights (Main street which was to my right) and the surrounding lights.  This shape was say 40 to 50 feet above me it seemed like and was taking a! northern flight path.  It seemed to be the speed of like a quad-copter or drone which my first thought was that someone probably is currently flying a drone because it would make a great camera/video of the event that night but after I was examining this object as it hovered slowly at the same altitude there were several brief moments in the play/show where there were no sounds so I had a good listen to the surrounding area while it was flying overhead and I noticed no sound coming from this craft.  After further thought I ruled out it was any quad copter/drone because something that size would be quite loud enough for me and others to hear it's props/engine.  I was asked by my family later when I told them what I saw why I didn't catch their attention when I saw it first but this whole experience took maybe 20-25 secs was all so I was recording this experience and taking in all of my senses in to determine what it was exactly.  Besides, if I would have told them about it and to look up, etc...  I would have missed more of the details! of what I saw.  In another detail of this craft I was prompted to remember the framing of this triangle/object I saw as it had thick bars outlining this triangle... almost thinking it was from an Erector set, haha, but again I saw no evidence of it being owned by people or could be bought in any Hobby store... as there were no sounds coming from it when all around me was quiet for a few seconds.  I following watching this object and even cupping my forehead and face to block other lights around me and it flew a northern path until I couldn't see it anymore as it flew into the darkness.  So it either flew at a higher altitude or flew away so far that the current surrounding lights that I was seeing it could not lite it up anymore.This experience prompted me to submit this post as I couldn't find any other UFO sighting/records around the area/valley with this same experience and description.Thank you for your attention.",Duration:25 seconds,"Location: Mesa, AZ",Occurred : 3/18/2016 20:20  (Entered as : 03/18/16 20:20),Posted: 3/24/2016,Reported: 3/23/2016 2:03:54 PM 14:03,Shape: Triangle

It was still, not moving at all, for the first 30 seconds or so that I saw it, and then it started to slowly float across the sky.  The object was not making any sound at all but it did have bright white/yellow lights around the object.  I quickly woke up my husband so that he could see this thing, and he also thought it was strange.  We both saw the object slowly float through the sky and I followed it as much as I could before I could not see it anymore.I also noticed there was a regular airplane further up in the sky at the same time which seemed to be traveling normally across the sky.  We live by an airport so I am used to seeing normal planes fly around our home.  But this object was flying way closer to the ground than an ordinary plane would, it made no sound whatsoever, and it was just standing still for a while before moving slowly away-which is not typical airplane behavior.There were two vehicles that were driving down my street at the same time of the sighting and I am certain they had to see this object too-I was hoping to find a sighting report here to confirm that we are not crazy.  :)((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She claimed she saw an incredibly blinding bright light, followed by these insane loud noises--that I also heard as I entered her bedroom.  The sounds were loud enough to fill my entire house, at first I thought it was construction, but it was midnight?  I thought of all possible things it could be, but we had never heard anything like it before.  It would just get louder and quieter, I can't even explain the noises, it sounded like muffled harsh rain (not a good example, but I can't describe it?), it was very staticy and so loud, so piercing almost?  And only in one area, the noise was coming from a distance from what we could hear.  Like around the corner?  Very creepy.  The noise would slow down and speed up, and that lasted for about 30 minutes as we watched and listened until it suddenly stopped, we heard soooo many sirens go off after that, and that lasted for 10 minutes, and then th! at also stopped all at once.  Quickly after the noises stopped, we noticed a couple bright orbs in the sky.  We noticed one while the noises were happening, but two more appeared brighter.  I live by an airport and yes, my first thought was helicopter, plane, jet, etc, ANYTHING but  but I have seen those fly overheard before many times.  We could all tell there was a difference. It was nothing we've ever seen before in the sky.  They would kind of faded in and out in a weird fuzzy way.  One of them headed in our direction overhead and we both got a better look at it, I was hanging out of the bedroom window at this point, even in the dark i could clearly see the shape was NOT a plane.  It was circular and disc like, it had a few blinking lights, and it continued to move overhead as well as the other ones surrounding it, they all spread out up until a certain point and then they just stopped and stayed there.

1691,"March 17, 2016, 2050 through 2100 San Ysidro, CA.  I observed two bright flashing lights approximately south/southwest at about 30-degrees about horizon.  At first I assumed they were helicopters moving easterly.  They gave the ""impression"" that they were quite distant, which would place them well into Mexico, south of Tijuana, at 15-20 thousand feet altitude (wild guess).  The two lights were bright, orange/reddish with a flickering point source in the direction of travel.  The lights were not a ""point source,"" but appeared to have an approximately oval and flickering shape.  The two lights moved in unison at perhaps 10-degrees separation.  The ""higher"" one then moved in an apparent downward direction directly toward the lower one.  In a span of about 10-seconds they appeared to merge and then separate, with the one moving down continuing the same trajectory.  It continued to move down, but started flickering in intensity over a span of about 15 seconds, after which it completely faded from sight.A third light then appeared further to the west, also moving in an easterly direction.  This would have placed it apparently well out to sea and south of the international border line.  It appeared to be about 20-degrees above the horizon.  After a minute or so it appeared to stop (hover?) and then moved south (down from my perspective) at what must have been great speed for its apparent distance, and then faded in intensity until lost from sight.The weather was clear, stars were visible, the moon was at its zenith overhead.  There might have been some haze toward the west over the ocean, at less then 5-degrees about the horizon.

1697,"Yard was lit up and a huge blinding bright light shaped like a sphere was moving towards the end of the street.I went to bed at or around 11:00 PM.  I have a sliding glass door covered with a white curtain right next to my bed.  I turned off the lights and got into bed and glanced at the sliding glass door.  I noticed that there were lights shining on the lower portion of the curtain. I thought that someone was outside with a flashlight pointing it towards my sliding glass door.  I was alone and so I was too  scared to look out through the glass to see who was out there.  Even though I was scared I went right to sleep. I woke up at or around 5:30 AM.  The thing that woke me up, was that my left hand was freezing cold.  I wondered how my hand could be so cold when it was under the blankets.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I got up I saw that the light had grown and that my entire window was now lit up with the light shining towards it.  This scared me more and I didn’t dare look out through the sliding glass door.  By the way, the sliding glass door leads to the back yard and there is no houses behind it and no streets facing that side of the house.I went into the adjacent room and looked out the window.  This window faced the side of the house and just around the corner from it is the back of my house.  The area was lit up as if there was lights on outside.  It was not coming from the next door neighbor’s house because no one lives there and there is no sensor lights on that house.  I then looked out the other window which faces the street.  I saw that it was dark across the street.  The lights on the house across the street were turned on as if they were up getting ready for work.  The houses next to that house were dark.  The house that had the lights on did not have a lit up yard as I did, the yard was lit but dim.  I then saw a light shining towards my house from the street and it looked like a car was coming.  I turned to see who it was and I saw a round light that was probably 6-8 feet diameter travelling toward the cul-de-sac.  The light was about 5 feet or so off of the ground and was so bright that it was blinding.  I waited for it to pass because I wanted to see what kind of truck it was.  When it passed my house, it disappeared.  At the same time the lights in the yard went out and it became dark.  I was left dumb founded and I couldn’t figure out if it disappeared because I was so blinded by the light or if it a new kind of truck with only one light.I couldn’t go back to sleep and nor could I make sense of what happened.  Later that day I asked the neighbors if they saw anything.  No one saw a thing and they all suggested that it might have been a UFO.  After thinking about it, I concluded that they might be correct.  I thought about it and remembered that UFOs have a lot of energy and concluded that if it was a UFO my Toyota Prius that is electric would have improved gas mileage.  Because my Prius measures mileage continuously, there was a record of mileage on the car.  I looked and saw that my highest mileage ever was 49 miles per gallon.

1714,"3rd sighting of a tube/cigar shaped craft flying South to North, the 1st being stationary over Mt. Shasta City.I live in Mt. Shasta, California.  I am about 60 miles from the Oregon border.  About two weeks ago, I saw a cigar or tube shaped craft flying northward, and my eyes and my daughter followed it for about 5, or so, minutes duration, until out of sight over the Mountain.I saw the same kind of craft last year that was somewhat higher in the sky this this latest one.  Oddly enough, they both took the same flight path though a year apart. South to the North and out of sight.  Both days I/we saw this, it was a clear blue sky with the sun behind us.  We used binoculars on the first one, from last year and I will attached a picture of that one.I can't embed the picture with this report as the computer says I'm missing some DLL file.  I will send it separately using my name and today's date.This year’s sighting was of the same type of craft, same flight route. Low enough to get over the 14,000 foot mountain and not much  more.  At no time during either sighting, there were no wings visible during the whole sighting, which literally was watched from the south to the north.  No flashing lights on either sighting.  No noise was heard. It wasn’t flying that fast.No tail rudder, no wings, no exhaust, no noise, no windows, no writing on it, no flashing lights or a hint of wings in the sun at any time produced a sight other than a tube or cigar shaped flying craft.It should be noted that both of these sightings were to the east side of the regular planes normal N/S flight routes.  I would think that during either of these sightings, there must have been regular planes that saw it, being in the regular N/S flight area.So to recap last year and this year I , and others saw this tube/cigar craft flying N/S air routes, with the object this year was higher than the 2nd one.I also have seen this same type of craft fairly up close and personal when I was when I was 6.  It should be noted that this first sighting was over the old drive in movie theater, and was HANGING STATIONARY with a tilt like this:  /.  I’d guess by the size of the trees now, that it was no more than 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air, not moving or drifting, again no sound, windows, writing or any burnt marks (as my dad showed me a paragraph it made in the Sacramento Bee, which claimed it was space junk falling to earth)  That was absolutely not the case, even though it was about 1966 at that time, I had watched many rockets lift off as we enjoyed watching together.  So I had an idea of what a regular rocket vs plane looked like at that time. I noticed many cars pulling off the road to watch this thing hanging the air at a such a low altitude, and not falling, flying, or moving at all.  This was at the junction of HWY 89 where it enters I-5.  Lots of cars pulled off the road to wat! ch.  It actually got a bit boring to me as a kid, it wasn’t doing anything but hanging there and we finally left. So I told my Dad about it.  After a few days, he showed me a newspaper report on the sighting which reported it as falling space junk.... I said no Daddy, that’s not right.  It wasn’t falling and there were no words on it, it was silver, not white, and no burn marks on it.  My mother and younger sister were with me.  My sister does not remember it.When I made the report of this first sighting, there was only 1 pilot who had also made a report of seeing this tube/cigar, in the air while he was flying in the area.Attached is the picture of the one I saw last summer.  It is just like the one from a few weeks ago, same S to N flight, only higher than the one a few weeks ago.Thanks you for listening to my story.",Duration:>5 minutes,"Location: Mount Shasta, CA",Occurred : 3/16/2016 14:00  (Entered as : 03/16 14:00),Posted: 4/22/2016,Reported: 4/15/2016 11:00:46 PM 23:00,Shape: Cigar

1718,"Triangular Aircraft SightingNorth Haven, South Australia.At 2145 I was sitting in my backyard outdoor spa looking at the stars, when I observed what initially looked like a formation of three triangular aircraft in a pyramid shape fly directly overhead.  I had a limited field of view due to the design of my house but the aircraft took five to eight seconds to transit across it and out of sight.My initial impression of the formation was that it was three Super Hornets travelling to local Airforce Base, but it was immediately apparent that they were the wrong shape and were travelling way too fast for aircraft at altitude.I then presumed that they were three large birds flying in a chevron formation, but the leading and trailing edges of the triangles were straight lines with smooth edges. No flapping or noise was observed.My final impression was that I was looking at three equally sized equilateral dark coloured (or black) triangles flying in a pyramid formation with their tips almost touching, or that it was one larger dark coloured triangle with a triangular center section cut from it.  I could clearly see the night sky through the triangular hole in the middle of the aircraft/formation.  No lights were visible on the aircraft and there was no reflections or glare from any of the surfaces.The aircraft travelled directly over me so I only saw it from underneath and I could not tell if it was medium sized and low to the ground, or very large and high.  My gut feeling was that it was 150 –300ft from the ground but I can’t really base that on anything more than how it appeared to me.  The craft/formation was probably twice the size of a full moon.The aircraft tracked from South to North. I tried to get out of the spa and continue to observe it but I broke contact and failed to regain it.  I suggest it may have been blocked from view by my neighbour’s house which is why I presume it was flying lower to the ground rather than at altitude.There was absolutely no noise associated with the aircraft which was probably the thing that most struck me as strange.  It literally glided past in silence in a dead straight line, directly above me.I called the Port Adelaide Police Station approximately 1 hour after the event and asked if any strange aircraft or flying triangles had been seen or reported during the evening.

At this exact moment, I was looking up at Orion, and picked up out of the corner of my eye an object, which moving from a Southern direction towards the North.

We saw one jet coming out of the Northeast, then we saw a faint, blue light zooming out of the west on an intercept course.

1725,"Military - Airplane Cloaking Tech being Tested.It's a perfectly clear day, my father and I were ending our sailing trip and as I look into the sky and I see this image of an airplane and I said to my dad, ""Look, theres a plane"" and he acknowledged seeing the image too.This plane however seemed like a transparent image of a plane.  I could clearly see the outline of the wing span and the cabin.  There seemed to be a bright light in the middle as if the sun was reflecting off of it.  Then from the outward of the image to the middle it started disappearing until the white light was the only thing left then vanished.Fairfield, Ca, has Travis Airforce Base and this would probably be a good flight plan for it.  I immediately thought I saw a military UFO/Optical allusion/ Cloud... about an hour later around the same spot I saw the same thing.  It seemed as if a plane was calibrating/testing a cloaking tech, or seeing how well they could scale up the tech as this unexplainded image of a transparent plane was kind of big.

My brother, who was behind the wheel, pointed out a bright flashing light above us, which was moving from North to South. I dismissed it as a small private plane as there is an airport near by.  However, when I looked at the bright flashing light, it made an abrupt 180 degrees turn.  At that moment, I thought it might be a drone.  However, further observation of the object made it clear that it was not a drone nor an airplane, or a helicopter.  The light was extremely bright, not typical of an airplane flashing lights.  It pulsated in a rapid three flashes pattern without any sound.  Our destination coincided with the trajectory of the object.  I kept my eyes on the object trying to figure out what it was.  What we observed while driving after it was something un-explainable.  The object seemed to skip by disappearing for a distance and reappearing further away, but not in a straight line.  I told my brother to pull over so we can observe the object.  At this point the object turned drastically to the West, again without clear logical flying pattern.  I told my brother to roll down the window to see if we can hear anything.  There was no sound.  The object continued to fly West then it seemed to hover in the distance.  It hung in the air for about 10 seconds.  The light seemed to dim as if the object flew away in a very fast manner, then the object shot directly up.  Few seconds later it reappeared slightly North-West.  At this time we heard a helicopter in the distance and saw a helicopter light, which my brother thought appeared to be searching for something.

I have no commercial electricity, but I do have solar power as I am off the grid.  I woke around 12:30 in the morning to put another log on the fire and took a look out my back window.

It moved very slowly. It was circular in shape and I thought I could see windows.  The lights from the windows were kind of yellowish like incandescent.   The flashing light was white like a slow strobe light.  It was followed by a second craft, perhaps 2 to 4 football fields behind it flying in perfect tandem.  They were about the same size but the craft following was in red light.  I would have thought it to be one huge craft but that is far bigger than anything man-made.  It seemed the front craft and the back craft seemed to be signalling with lights.  The one in front would flash and then the one behind in rhythm.  The front craft had white lights and the back was in red.  They were moving very slowly and crossed beside the cabin so I lost sight.  I looked around in the dark for my binoculars but I could not find them.  There was something creepy about it, and I was afraid to turn the lights on in the cabin to find the binoculars.  I did grab the camera however and went out to the front door which faces East South East.  The craft(s) continued at the same speed away from me and seemed to be climbing.  I got the impression it was mapping or searching for something like a Google Earth project.  It made me nervous.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  I waited until it passed far into the distance in case it was very high and the sound might come later but there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.The best I could do was take a few long exposures with the camera braced up against the cabin as the thing flew away to the south west.

As I unhooked the chain I was drawn to look up towards a bright moon.  It had been somewhat cloudy and I had not noticed any moon up until now.

I have the impression that it had traveled from the south and turned west, but I did not see it actually turn or change direction.  I did see it travel, and it was quiet, fast, had no trailing tail of smoke or light, and was like it was on fire in a colour similar to natural gas (without any yellow or white) when used on a cooking stove.  I had seen falling stars, planes , jets, helicopters, lasers, fireworks, this was nothing like them.  I was once in a place and two of us heard a crackling and looked up to see debris coming thru the atmosphere, this egg was nothing at all like that.

1785,"UAP had no outline or structure, no sound, a random brilliant clean strobe white & red light, disappearing into a gray misty portal.As prior MUFON Utah Asst. State Director I was hesitant to report this sighting, being my first credible Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) sighting but now the shoe is on the other foot.To set the stage right, my balcony looks east to the Wasatch Front.  To the north Ben Lomond, Mt Ogden is directly East from my balcony, and then you can see southeast beyond the radar towers on Francis Peak.  My home is right on the flight pattern of Ogden Airport (1/3 mile), Hill Air Force Base (3 Miles), and Salt Lake City Intl. (20 Miles), all as the crow flies. So lights in the sky has been has been a part of my life for nearly 44 years.On 03/11/2016, I woke up at 0505, walked over to the sliding glass door of the dining room, poked my head through the curtains and saw a light 1000 ft. above Mt. Ogden (9505 elevation) at Azimuth 40 degrees N41E.  I first saw Arcturus, and then saw another light off to the left of it, moving slowly up and then NW which triggered my instincts...quite unusual at this time of the morning.  It flashed a brilliant white a couple times and then flashed  a brilliant red.  I knew right away that was not normal.  It then moved upward slowly but noticeably and then very slowly headed WNW toward Ogden.  By this time it has really caught my attention.  I had to put both hands up to the glass door and face to block out the surrounding light on the glass from inside.  The light would flash randomly 2-3 times a pure clean white light in comparison to a strobe light effect and then randomly a pure clean red flash would happen.  The lights were completely independent from of other.  With my 37 years around aircraft and working Safety in the government, this was not in the military inventory.I have always had all of my investigation gear next to the sliding door just in case something like this would occur I would be totally prepared. Unfortunately,  I had been out of town in Nephi the night before on a UAP investigation and had put all of my gear downstairs in the office.  So I hurried to turn off the home security alarm, went downstairs to grab my gear, headed back up to the balcony all along being away from the sighting for approximately one minute.  Fortunately, when I got back it was still there heading towards my westerly direction.  Then It started turned heading NW.  I immediately threw a few shots of my green laser light at its side with no response from the UAP. I could tell that the red flashing light was located below and a little forward of the white flashing light because at one time they flashed almost instantaneously.The UAP is now between Ogden Airport and I-15 heading NW.  Turning again and heading north, in less than 10 seconds you could see that it was starting to lose its flashing brilliance. It faded out and entered a gray misty cloud and completely disappeared into a portal.  The mist dissipated almost immediately following the UAP disappearance.The strangest thing is that this UAP had no outline, structure, and no sound.  It was just the movement and brilliant lights that gave it intelligence.  Had this been a plane you would have seen it still flying out at a much further distance with the lights flashing off of wing tips and tail section.  The other odd part of this sighting is that planes do not have a flight pattern coming straight over Mt. Ogden heading west toward the Ogden Airport and aircraft don't come down in this area doing a fly over at this time of morning.The speed of the object during this whole sighting was that of a small plane.  Ceiling was 10 miles, clear with no wind.  Total time start to finish was approximately 2 minutes or less.  Had this been during the summer with leaves on the trees, I would not have seen the UAP enter and disappear into the portal.There are many lessons for me here! I've played this scenario out in my head 100's of times in case I ever saw a UAP . Take a deep breath or three, always have binoculars/monocular, green laser, night vision, camera/cell phone fully charged and nearby. But the big lesson I learned...why didn't I just grab my phone 25 feet away. I may have had a chance to put it on film with something to show instead of just this witness report and telling my friends, “Well, I saw my first UAP”!  If a recording hadn't shown up on the phone, it would have at least shown that I gave my best shot for visual evidence.  I kick myself everyday saying, “Why did you do that!”  It happens occasionally with witnesses admitting it in their UAP Reports when you see your first UFO…your just not yourself.Remember though, "" Absence on evidence, isn't evidence on absence.""",Duration:00:02,"Location: Roy, UT",Occurred : 3/11/2016 05:05  (Entered as : 03/11/2016 05:05),Posted: 6/1/2016,Reported: 5/28/2016 1:37:42 PM 13:37,Shape: Unknown

I had my phone on the dashboard and i picked it up and took one pic of it.  I looked at it for about 20-30 seconds and it just stood there.  I have never seen anything like it.  It was not a plane or a hot air balloon or a friggin helicopter.  I dont know what it was but i thought it was weird and took a pic of it.  Then the traffic started moving and i forgot about it and concentrated on driving.""  That is what he roughly said.

He just kept going off the subject and didn't want to entertain me on my UFO thoughts.

1798,"bright round pinpointed flashing white light traveling from the north to the south at a high altitude.I had just arrived home from working the night shift.  It was approximately 0410 in the morning.  It was windy outside, due to an approaching storm system from the west, but a part of the sky was clear and there were approaching clouds.  I decided to stop outside my front door to take a look at the sky, and listen to the wind blowing through the trees.  While looking up into the night sky at almost ninety degrees I observed a single bright pinpointed flash of white light.  I can only describe it as appearing like the flash of a camera except much slower and estimated to last approximately one to one and one half seconds.  I was amazed at how bright this light was when it flashed.It appeared to be extremely high in the sky and there were no other lights to accompany it.  There was no aircraft engine sound that I could hear.  It would flash approximately every ten to fifteen seconds and it was moving from north to south.  It was above cloud level, as I tracked it by its flash, I could no longer see it as it passed above the approaching clouds.  I could not see any type or shape of a structure around the light.  But it must have been attached to an object as the light seemed to dim slightly as it traveled south.  It traversed the sky directly over Pensacola NAS.  I have lived in the vicinity of Pensacola NAS for approximately twenty years and have never observed anything like this before.  I have served in the military and am extremely familiar with aircraft beacon, strobe, navigation, and landing lights.I thought possibly some type military drone, but the wind was very strong and I am not sure if the military would fly a drone in such weather.  It must have been at an altitude above the storm weather as it did not appear to be affected by the wind.

1817,"Strange object seen above Long Island, NY, that I cannot explain.I was standing in the kitchen with my wife, looking out the window, as I often do, when I noticed a strange object in the sky.   I immediately knew I was seeing something that I do not see regularly, but as I watched it, I became fascinated.  I quickly went outside and watched what appeared to be a pyramid like shape, very dark, possibly metallic black in color slowly hovering towards us.  I was thinking drone at first but it seemed too high up in the sky to be anything controlled from the ground.  It continued to move toward us slowly, and I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second.  I thought maybe it was some kind of strange helicopter (it seemed to be about that size) and I thought I could see some kind of swirling above it, but I could not focus on anything for sure.  I then noticed two very small objects hovering around it.  One stayed kind of below it and the other to the right of it.  They would seem to change distances from the object, but never move to far towards it or away.  These objects were coming out of the east and then turned and started moving higher into the sky and north.  I thought I saw it wobble a bit before it headed north.  The smaller objects also looked very dark, black and would occasionally glint like metal from the sun for a second, just as the larger pyramid like structure did.  As it began to climb and head north, it appeared to have an energy bubble around it for a few seconds.  It was light blue (cyan) circle of energy around it and my heart started racing when I saw this.  It was quite visible first and maybe a minute later I saw it again but very faint.  As it continued North, I began to start thinking about it and if it was some kind of strange balloon?  It made no noise at all.  It continued North until it faded from my vision.  My wife ran to get my binoculars but by that time it was very distant.  She wears glasses and did not have them with her, so was unable to see any details.I don't know what I saw, but it was very strange.  I keep thinking it could have been some kind of very elaborate balloon, but it feels like my rational mind is just trying to make sense of it.  I've never seen anything in the sky even remotely like this and I hope that some of the other millions of Long Islanders have seen this and can give more information.  I love to hear your updates each week on Coast to Coast, but I never thought I was going to see anything to report, but I quickly thought of you afterwards and felt it was my responsibility to report this, even if it was just some hoax.  I'm sorry I didn't take any pictures but I couldn't move and I don't carry my phone around with me.  I hope my report is of some use to you!  I hope someone took pictures!  Keep up the great work and keep looking up!   Best Regards,   ((name delete))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter! I wanted to let you know I did contact news 12 to report my sighting, but the experience was not favorable.  I should mention that I have empathic abilities and also intuitive flashes.  When I spoke to the individual on the phone, I could immediately sense hostility towards me and the information I was trying to convey.  Not only that but this person was frustrated by how many people like me were also trying to report such sightings.  I could sense his hands were tied concerning this subject.  Finally to my disbelief, although it was over 3 hours since the sighting, when I asked if anyone else had called in to report a similar sighting he said no but I was certain he was lying.

1827,"At above hour and minute I was flying my DJI Phantom 3 adjacent my garage.  I wanted night videos of the city and elevated the craft to 120 meters where it hovered.  As I was looking up at it my eye caught a craft flying in from the South, proceeding North.  I estimate its elevation at approx 1000 feet.  It was just below the cloud cover.  The craft appeared to light up via a blinking light which immersed most of the craft.  It was like nothing I have ever seen on an airplane.  It was as though it completely enveloped the craft in a strange sort of grey light, at intervals, or perhaps a running light lit the sides of the craft, the sides perhaps being grey in color, I am not sure.  I am former Air Force and a retired Police Officer.  I do watch the skies.  The object was moving very quickly and was lost to sight as it proceeded North.  There was no noise associated with the object.  Had this been a fighter Jet, for instance an F-18 out of Beale, I would have certainly heard the jet engines.  I redirected my attention to the Phantom, and then quickly noticed that there was a large multi-prop airplane coming directly at (so it appeared) my Phantom.  This aircraft appeared to be VERY LOW.  It flew in from the West and proceeded East until lost to sight.  It was running a number of lights that were turned on, I am not sure if these were landing lights, but I dont think so.  It actually intersected the course of the unknown craft only be about 20 seconds, and this airplane really startled me.  I am still a little shaken by the whole thing.  We do have P-3's flying out of Beale I believe and you see them in this area quite often, BUT this P-3 (I'm assuming it was P-3) was EXTREMELY LOW.  I attempted to bring down my Phantom quickly because it almost appeared both phantom and aircraft were at the same altitude, and for a minute I thought they might collide.

I thought the object was a stealth bomber.  I pulled over to the side of the road, took a picture of it with my cell phone, and called my mother.

As it flew faster toward me, I rolled down my car window, stuck my head out the window, and looked at it as it passed over me.  It was huge and flying at a very low height – around the ! height a crop-duster might fly.  Each side seemed to be 75’ – 100’.  I was awestruck at how something that big could stay in the air and then I realized it was silent and I freaked out a bit.I remember thinking that I needed to note the location and I remember passing by Holeman-Ashley Road, but I don’t remember if that was right before or after I saw the object.After the object passed over me it quickly was out-of-sight.

I didn’t gave a pen in my glove box or front seat, so I got out of my car to see if I had one in my purse on the back seat.  As soon as I exited the car, I noticed that many dogs were barking hard.  It was eerie.After recording everything, I got back into my car and started driving to my original destination.  Someone drove up behind me, started tailgating me, and followed me to my destination about 25 miles away.  I was upset about it but then I remembered looking in my rear view mirror when I had pulled over to watch the object, and I had seen a blue car pull over about 200 feet behind me.  The car that was following me was also blue and I think that person might be a witness, too.  In retrospect, I think that person might have been following me to see if I saw what he or she saw.  If someone contacts me about this incident, I have the make, model and license plate number of the blue car, but I never spoke to the person, in case the person was a nut.One other thing to note…before I left my house and saw the object, I let my dogs outside in my yard for about 15 minutes.  When I went outside to get them and bring them inside, all three were hiding under my porch.  One of my dogs frequently does this, but not all three dogs.  Again, in retrospect, I wonder if they sensed something was different.",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Hurdle Mills, NC",Occurred : 3/6/2016 20:19  (Entered as : 03/06/16 20:19),Posted: 3/11/2016,Reported: 3/7/2016 6:01:27 PM 18:01,Shape: Diamond
1840,"Large object over southwestern sky in W Massachusetts, bright lights, slow moving object, changing shapes.I went outside and actually was looking for anything moving in the sky. (Because I actively now seek this stuff out) I spent 20mins looking at all the stars and trying to find an odd one. In the south western sky high over the tree line I noticed there was 3 star looking objects in formation of a perfect triangle, and a very bright looking star next to the formation (so 4 all together)  At first, I kept staring at this formation as I found it odd all the objects were stationary  and I have never noticed this constellation of stars.I kept searching but could not find anything I thought. I went back inside then went back out to smoke again 20 mins later.I could not find the triangle formation that was previously there but did still see the big bright star. I stared at it and saw bright lights coming from it.  Greens, bright blues, red, orange all the colors of the rainbow.  It was moving very slowly but fast enough (in all directions up, down, and horizontally) and now I could see it was changing it kept making a red triangle and I'm not sure if it was just flashing this or if that was the shape.  It also flashed a few other pictures/shapes one looked like a pine or Xmas tree)  At some points I could see it looked like a classic ufo...round, seamless, and rotating horizontal lights, but as I stared harder at it, it was changing to a triangle then to a round object. At a few points it looked diamond shaped then maybe it could have been multiple ufos in formation it changed so often I could not tell. Sometimes the entire thing got very bright then it had and aura around it.The flashing different bright lights never fades though only when a regular plane flew by did it stay stationary and white.It had to be very far away because I had no readings on my magnetometer.And I know how crazy this might sound but I want to be honest I felt waves coming from this, only when it was in view and I was staring at it.  It felt like my vision was like twilight zone everything went black and then bright in and out.  At one point there was stripped lights down trees in my vision as my vision blacked in and out.  There was no fear or pain or negativeness I really didn't feel much while in this trance state (it also felt voluntary but hypnotized)other than pure interest/curiousity and I tried to allow the waves to take over as far as they would go but once I blinked the waves stopped and started over again until I blinked or the object went out of veiw.The object eventually slowly fell out of veiw within a little over an hour (it fell behind the trees) & my boyfriend who thinks aliens are absurd started yelling at me, but I wanted to get in my car and follow it.  Too bad I was unable to.Please note I did try to video tape this effect but I could not hold my phone long enough to get anything also every time I tried the object did not look the same as it did in person I believe this is due to my phone not having a good camera and I was shaking and could not hold it still.",Duration:2 hours,"Location: Orange, MA",Occurred : 3/6/2016 20:00  (Entered as : 03/06/2016 20:00),Posted: 3/11/2016,Reported: 3/6/2016 7:41:06 PM 19:41,Shape: Changing

1846,"March 6, 2016.  I was driving with my wife, stepdaughter, and two grandchildren at about 1850 hours, when we notice a line of lights moving North East to South West.  I pulled over into Veterans Park behind the Merritt Square Mall on Merritt Island  to take a look at the lights.  I  got out of the car and I thought I heard helicopters off in the distance.  Patrick AFB is South  of our location so I thought that it was something going on at the base.  I got back in the car and turned around and stopped and opened my wife’s  window  to let her hear what I thought where helicopters.  She said that she couldn’t hear anything.  I got out of the car to listen and look at the lights and I could not hear any noise.We looked again and saw a lot more of the light moving in the same line, North East to South West.  I got out of the car and looked and listened and could not hear anything.  I got my phone and used the camera and started taking a movie of the lights.  We would watch a group of 10 to 15 lights go by when another line of lights would appear.  It looked like the lights would disappear when they got on passed us in the same place.  This lasted around 20 minutes.  Finally the lights stopped and we went on our way.It looked like they were coming from Cape Canaveral which was north of us and I estimated the lights where about 1000 to 2000 feet high.   Patrick AFB does not have that many aircraft assigned to the base so I don’t believe they came from the base.  Most of the time when I am out at the base I might see a couple of helicopters and two to three C-130s.I don’t know what the lights where.

I was outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm CST, on Saturday March 5, 2016.  To my southeast I saw a moving bright red light that was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me.  It was flying northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow Garland Road from Casa Linda Plaza to Whiterock Marketplace Shopping Center, where it then turned northward toward Lochwood Park (Google Map).At first, I thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. Its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter.  I looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had a steady intense red.  Since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, I quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct.  No craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light.  Then, I purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence.  The craft then swung around from my southeast to my northeast, apparently making a 45-degree left turn, and headed northwest, keeping 1-mile distance from me.  When it was to my northeast, I lost sight of it because of trees.

It was somewhat low key.I have witnessed several anomalous objects over Dallas within the past three years, but had not paid attention to any before 2013.  The different mindset that was forced upon me by my extremely vivid 2014 sighting has made me recognize that it is equally as important to identify UFOs as to discount them, and to not take a perpetually skeptical position.  It is a much greater crime to see a flying saucer and dismiss it as “swamp gas” than to see swamp gas and label it as a “flying saucer.”  When you see a light in the sky that does not behave like any normal object, it probably is not a normal object.

The lights moved behind a tree and as I moved to continue to watch the lights they were gone.  Single lights contined to appear from what seemed like one place in the sky.

1870,"March 4, 2016  I was unloading groceries from my trunk when a jet overhead happened to catch my eye.  It was leaving a very short double streak against a totally cloudless sky.  This was around 4 pm so the sky was exceptionally blue.At this point I noticed what appeared to be a cloud but it was completely round, and as the sky was totally cloudless this really caught my attention.While watching the “cloud” I then saw a point of white light at its center.  This point of light then zigzagged rapidly at about 45 degree angles after which it darted to the right (north) and went into a free-form looping pattern.  It then zigzagged again, and with the “cloud” not completely covering it there seemed to be a triangular shape that possibly the light was zipping around the edge of.  The light and its companion “cloud” then continued moving south, zipping, zigzagging and looping while moving across the sky until it went into the horizon and out of site.  There is an airport nearby but this object did not move in the direction of that airport.There was no sound and the weather was exceptionally good – cloudless sky, very little wind.Watching this object took my attention away from the jet so I don’t know where it went but it was not in the direction of the object(s)or the airport.I have never seen anything like this and with all the political stuff going right now– the debates, the primary vote, Flint’s water issue, the guy in Kalamazoo shooting people – it’s really freaked me out.

1878,"Several orange lights flying separately and in triangular formation, accompanied by a loud roaring noiseWe were all inside (2 adults, 3 kids) watching TV after dinner.  My husband went outside to smoke a cigarette, and while he was outside there was a loud roaring noise that came from outside the house.  It sounded like a huge snow plow pushing ice off the road, but the roads are clear.  My husband banged on the window for me to come outside, saying there were strange lights in the sky. I went out onto the front porch, facing East, and saw at least 4 rapidly moving lights in the sky.  Our children joined us outside as well.The lights were moving from West to East, and were orange.  The lights were larger than the stars but smaller than the moon, and they moved very fast, crossing from the West horizon to the East horizon before turning around again in less than ten seconds.  We live in a mountainous area, in a valley which makes our view somewhat restricted, but in the sky that we see the lights were crossing  from one end to the other much faster than planes fly overhead, and there were no clouds blocking our view. It was incredibly cold and clear.When we first saw the lights, there were four and they were flying separate from each other.  Two of the lights moved towards each other and at first seemed to merge and become one slightly larger light before separating again and then appearing to zigzag around each other like they were tracing a double helix.  When the lights were separate, they appeared to blink, but when they came together they stayed solid.  At one point, a third light joined the first two lights, and then all three formed a triangular formation and flew in that pattern for about 20 seconds.  Again, while flying together, they stayed solid and did not blink.  The lights then broke away from each other and made hairpin turns very quickly and moved back towards the West.  As they moved West, they were again blinking and flying in zigzags around each other.  There was a fourth light at this time, that appeared to follow the first three.  This light looked like it was actually 4 smaller lights closely together in! a cube formation, and these appeared to be green.  The small green cube followed more slowly behind the first three, and they all moved towards the Western horizon.  The whole time these lights were moving, there was a loud roaring coming from the sky that was loud enough to shake the windows in the house, and the closer the lights got to the horizon the softer the roaring was until the lights and the noise stopped.We all went back inside, and about 10 minutes later, we heard the roaring start again, so we ran back out onto the porch looking back towards the west, which is towards the back of our house looking towards the treeline.  The roaring continued for about a minute, then abruptly stopped for about 30 seconds, started again for about a minute then abruptly stopped again, repeating this pattern several times.  While we heard the roaring, we could see lights moving over the horizon towards the West, but they were blocked by the trees so we couldn't see if they were in a formation or be sure of how many there were.  This episode lasted for about 3 minutes before the roaring stopped abruptly one final time and did not begin again.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: West Topsham, VT",Occurred : 3/3/2016 20:30  (Entered as : 03/03/16 20:30),Posted: 3/4/2016,Reported: 3/3/2016 7:23:32 PM 19:23,Shape: Changing
1879,"Several orange lights moving in odd and changing patternsI stepped onto the front porch for a cigarette, and I heard an extremely loud noise that was like a snow plow on the road, but it was clear and the roads were bare.  I glanced towards the South, and I noticed that there was movement in the sky, at least 2 objects moving rapidly.  I rapped on the window to get my wife's attention so she could see the lights in the sky.  She came out, and we both began to question each other as to what they could be.  The noise had faded at this point, but we could still see the lights in the sky.  They seemed to be a reddish-orange and appeared to be solid.  They were moving towards the East in a wavy pattern.  We saw at that time there was a third trailing them.  They reached a point in the East and appeared to make a quick turn, almost like a sling-shot, and formed a triangle while they were moving back towards the West.  They then moved into a parallel line, then almost appeared to merge into one light, then separated again.  Our kids had come out at this point, and we realized that we were losing visibility, as the lights were moving back to the West.  We watched them continue to move back and forth from West to East and back, moving in different patterns, making the wavy pattern around each other, then forming a triangle, then a line, and then changing again. At this point, I noticed over the Western tree line there appeared to be a larger bluish light staying in a stationary position.  At this point, I thought to myself that if it was a helicopter, why wasn't I hearing anything, and it seemed to be very high if it was truly a helicopter.

1917,"Giant mass of clustered lights miles long moving through skyMy brother and I live in a gated community in Indio.  Our mailbox center is at the entrance of the community and we decided to ride our bikes to get the mail around 19:00.  We are both about 30 years old, very interested in other forms of life and UFO activity, although never seeing anything ourselves or looking for it.  As we're riding, my brother stops me and tells me to look at the weird stars above.  It was a line of stars about the length of 4 big dippers long, clustered close together.  We both quickly realized that this was not a star formation and became overcome by the size.  They soon started expanding and contracting to one another, not dramatically or quickly, but subtly.  There were at least 70 lights above, each dimming and brightening.  If they were more spread out, the average person would assume they were stars.  We then watched this massive unity of lights move across the sky from the west.  We could see a tip that was the front of what looked like t! he biggest object.  To be clear, we couldn't see any object, but because lights were around it's perimeter, we could make out the shape of the front which was pointed.  The best way to describe how it moved is almost like a caterpillar, certain parts moving away and toward each other (expanding and contracting) while the thing as a whole moved forward at the same speed.  I was in complete awe.  We watched a few planes come into view which moved much faster and were much closer than this thing, which was so far away, it had to be in space.  All the lights slowly dimmed except three at the tail of the mass, which formed a perfect triangle.

It was the biggest thing I ever saw pilot through the sky.So quickly I pulled over the car to get a better look.  The object was maybe 1000 ft high from ground level which is actually very close and I could pretty much see its make up even though it was dark.  The object was your ""generic"" triangular shape with a white light on every point of the triangle and a small flickering red light in the center.  The object was far too big to be a helicopter and almost too big to be any type of large plan.  The object also made absolutely no sound which is ridiculous for something of that size and low to the ground.  I knew for a fact this was not an aircraft that was normal to these skies.  The object moved at a very slow pace but seemed to be covering ground quickly do to its size.  The aircraft also made several manuvers that seemed odd for any normal aircraft, flying almost completely sideways at some points.

I decided to get back in the car and pull forward to see behind the trees but after that I no longer saw the object. I've always believed in the type of activity but still never had any prove.

It also changed between irregular and equilateral, also changing in size from its largest being roughly 34m in length to its smallest - the length of a small car.I decided to continue on my way as I had already been there a good while, once I reached my house (15 minutes later) I looked back and it was still there, in total I watched it for 45 minutes.  It made no noise, put out no other light except the three on its corners, and managed to remain completely stationary in the air.That, paired with the constant feeling of pressure on my ears, assures me that this was something other than a man-made object.

This object remained invisible for approximately 5 seconds, when suddenly it began to re-appear.Once it reached full brightness and size, I could discern that the lights were not an exact straight line, but seemed to curve under and out at the front of the object.  I infer from this effect that the lights were possibly arranged in a V or chevron pattern, and that I was observing the object nearly edge on.  The details of the shape can be viewed in the included rough sketch.  The object continued moving west for approximately 10 more seconds before fading from view again, disappearing permanently this time. At no time was I able to see a solid object.  There were two other witness that I know of at my work center that saw the object as well.My coworker and I have years of military experience between us in the USAF. Neither one of us had ever seen an object quite like this.  There are many types of aircraft that operate at Edwards AFB, nothing we know of matches the behavior of these lights.  It is our opinion that these lights were not aerial flares.  They moved in unison and did not vary in altitude.  What we saw was either a large group of objects flying in a extremely tight formation, or that these lights were part of a single, large object.  The behavior and consistent altitude of the lights, the distance between them and the lateral motion leads me to believe they were part of the same object.Also, I believe there are witness to the same event outside my exact location. Reference MUFON case number 74891, a report made on the same day in California City of a very similar object.

1948,"Day time morphing ufo.  From one object to 5 objects!!On February 29th, 2016, at 5:28pm, from North East U.S.A, my wife and I were outside.  My wife then saw something strange flying from a distance.  I quickly grabbed my Samsung galaxy Note 3 and began recording.  It was difficult to see at first until it got closer and we noticed it was changing shapes and went from one object to at one point up to 5 distinct objects flying together morphing and so on.  I thought at one point it was a helicopter carrying something, then realized it wasn't.  Then a totally red helicopter appeared from nowhere which is in itself unusual for us, we have never seen a red helicopter in our city, ever.  The helicopter appeared to be hovering above us watching this U.F.O!  When I finally uploaded the video and took a closer look WOW ! I paused the video at different intervals and captured those as images and the zoomed in closer, and unbelievable.  We seen many different symbols within what appeared to be like an invisible bubble around each of the objects many of the symbols were crosses.  One in particular when it was three objects each had a different symbol, a cross, what appeared to be an image of a d.n.a strand, ie. double helix, and the third looks like a person kneeling down on their knees praying.  I will send original video, along with a couple of the different images we get out of these ufos. It was truly amazing.  My wife was a real sceptic until this happened on the anniversary of her grandmother's birthday, leap year day.

1979,"12+ UFOS Observed by Single Witness9:15pm, on a clear Saturday night sky.  Standing behind my garage near my neighbor's back yard facing northwest.  Adjusting phone camera settings, when coincidently look up to a large figure moving less than 10mph above my neighbor's back yard moving in a straight path northwest.  Looking up at the object, I estimate it to have been between 50 and 60 feet high as it was just above the trees in my neighbor's yard and took a sharp right turn over my yard, to where the garage I stood behind blocked my vision.  I observed this object  for only about 7 seconds.  These were my observations:  1. Boomerang Structure with 50-60 foot wingspan, 2.  Less than 10 feet tall,  4. Surface color(s): Deep Black Borders Surrounding The Various Components of its underside,  3. Small White Rectangles Aligned Closest to the Sharp, Anterior Edge of the craft (7 on each side),  4. ""Components"" or intricate plates comprising the underside, most of which had edges parralel to the adjac! ent edges of the craft itself,  5.  Simpler Patterns alongside edges of the craft, and no middle, dividing borderline,  6.  All observed edges but the anterior edge were curved/smooth,  7.  Craft gets thicker getting nearer to the center.5-10 minutes later:  An object less less than 500 feet away and 100-150 feet high, moving in a straight path at around 70mph Southwest. A Yellow ""Mist"" forming an arrowhead with its anterior corners separated.  Object was not thick and nearly flat, with a wingspan of around 80 feet.  The separated corners merged into the middle part of the craft after about 4 seconds of observing it to then zoom into the distance and out of sight. During this observation I stood in the driveway of my backyard.10-20 minutes later:  Standing in front of my house on the sidewalk this time, moving lights catch my eye coming from the East and Moving West about 500 feet high descending to less than 100 feet in altitude after moving about 1000 feet in a perfectly straight path. These were my observations:  Pure White Circles And Ovals Forming a capital letter T, 1. The front, horizontally aligned ovals, both at each end slightly larger than the ovals in the middle(4 total),  2. The ""tail"", perfect, pure white circles level with one another and most of which were aligned in the center but never symmetrically.  The ""tail"" had a difference in elevation between the front part of about 30 feet, 3. The circles forming the ""tail"": Flat with a diameter of about 15 feet,  4. All "" T-shaped"" formations moved between 70-90 mph in a straight path East to West, 5. At least 4 were witnessed, 3 of which I can make accurate depictions of and all of which appeared betw! een intervals of 10-20 minutes.Another Yellow ""Mist"" but this time shaped almost as an equilateral triangle moved under the first ""T-Shape"" formation I witnessed as it passed just above me, with each side being 40-50 feet long. This object moved Southeast to Northwest at about 30mph in a straight path about 70 feet high. Again, this ""Mist"" was flat and seemed transparent because of that, making it somewhat faint, but nonetheless glowing. Observed for only about 5 seconds. Last hour or so of this 3 hour event: Large Boomerang Formations of Perfect, Pure White Circles began to appear moving East to West but taking very wide left turns Southwest and Moving at speeds of at least 100mph just above the houses North of my position. From all formations observed but one, the circles never formed symmetrical Shapes. Some were triangular and some were very wide-angled boomerang formations. All but one took the same path as the rest of these light formations. The one I am referring to is the only symmetrrical light formation I witnessed and the closest object I observed that night: I noticed a line of circular lights approaching me from down the street but moving above the houses, and as it approached I noticed it was rotating slowly counter-clockwise as a whole and as soon as it did this, 3 of these flat white circles aligned themselves individually into the right side of the formation but we're already near the rest when I observed this. As it passed o! ver me and my house, it was in an almost parralel to the street suggesting that this maneuver was only made to avoid the tree in my front yard which is 50-60 feet tall. This formation was level with the ground until it was completely aligned and symmetrical to then tilt leftward at 40°-60° and take a wide left turn Southwest and gain significant speed(100+mph). I chased after several of these formations. At least 5 witnessed and 4 of which I can accurately depict. Even from close proximity, no noise could be heard and no temperature changes felt nor structures Observed surrounding these lights. These circular light were about 10-15 feet in diameter and the formed formation of at least 100 feet wide. When in a triangular formation, the lights were farther from each other than when formed in a boomerang formation. These lights were visible on both sides, conforming that no visible structures surrounded them. I cannot say the same for the ""letter T"" formations as I w! as not able to observe them from close enough proximity to dis! tinguish this. Between these last sightings, a unique UFO in comparison to the rest: A blue light bordering the bottom of an invisible craft rotating counter -clockwise. From the center, 3 lines extending and protruding out each corner. This object was about 1000 feet away from my position and about 100 feet high moving East to West at speeds of at least 100 mph.

I was admiring the beautiful cloud formations when I noticed a very bright object, rectangle or oblong in the south east sky.  It was too far for me to see the details.  I first thought it was a reflection of the sun on a cloud but it didn't move when the clouds did.  After about ten minutes, I didn't notice it there.  Then after about ten more minutes, I saw it again, more directly east, it was stationary and was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  (I am not good at knowing degrees, so I am guessing but you can observe it from my photos). There was a boat out in the ocean that looked as it may have been trying to go towards the object, I presume for curiosity sake.  Then a small plane and two helicopters flew around above us at the beach.The black helicopter was  hovering over the ocean, then moved over the beach (going east to west , yet sideways????), most likely trying to photograph it from a distance????

2003,"I observed UFO through 15x70 binoculars, so close that I could see black dust on the walls of the ""vehicle.""I was coming out on the balcony for a cigarette (I do not smoke illicit drugs nor I don't drink alcohol; was wearing eye glasses at the time of the event).When I was siting on the chair and looking outside (photo attached) I saw strange looking triangle/grey object.  It didn't have any lights whatsoever and it was slowly moving from right to the left (as on the photo) and (north to south on map).  I knew right away that it is something strange and can not be airplane.  We don't have airplane flying this way, I have never seen one.  And all airplanes, helicopters have flashing light this was as dead piece of ring like round concrete color object in the air.I wear glasses and I had them on during sighting, after seeing that it is something strange I quickly opened the balcony door and grabbed my Celestron 15x70 Binoculas (which I have always ready staying beside the balcony door (I watch birds, eagles, airplanes, etc).   When I got binoculars and looked back it was right on the top of the building and moving slowly south.  It is hard to identify it quickly in binoculars.  That's why I looked at the building first, then up, and I got image sharp exactly at the object.      My knees shaking a little, and I screamed to my wife to come and see.  I probably looked at it 6 seconds, and I just could not believe what I see.  I will describe it here: As you can imagine first it looked just like something large grey ((?)) in the sky, but after binoculars magnification it was clear as day.  I saw a grey colored like concrete round object.  it was reminding me as a vehicle tire as if you would put it flat on the ground but without center (wedding ring like).  It was grey without any lights or windows. It looked in some places  like it was dirty dark/black dust.  It looked like an old spaceship after entering atmosphere burned in some places.  It definitely looked not as shiny as other people describe.It was grey ,made object with black dust parts all over it.  It felt like this ship went through places for sure.  What was most interesting that it didn't just fly straight left, it was gliding like a rock if you throw it on the top of the lake.  It was gliding on the air and it looked so light not like airplane fly heavy in the sky this object was gliding and I felt that it was crashing.I turned around to call my wife and screamed for her to come over, when I turned back it was gone.In measurements I would say it looked in length of Boeing 777 and round like a ring with a hole in the center.Why I was lucky that it was couple days after full moon and it was still bright and big.  The moon was exactly behind me that moment, so all moon light was going towards this UFO.  I believe only because of this I saw it.  It is easy to see birds flying at night when the get light from the city or the moon on them.      I draw how it looked right away and I took a photo of the view (edited in Photoshop of exact dimensions how it appeared to me on that night).I hope it helps and maybe someone would recognize seeing the same.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone, and he seemed to us to be a quite serious, and sober-minded individual.

The formation was clearly visible and still moving West at a steady speed.Suddenly, from the East appeared a huge formation of 10 additional bright objects heading in the same Westerly direction at the same speed.  These were in a distinct formation, and I was able to photograph this second formation with my iPhone as well as take a short video.The lead object was out in front of the second formation by a considerable distance.

Both formation never changed speed, shape, or direction at anytime.

2022,"Cigar-shaped object about the size of an airliner tracking slowly across the sky.While attending my daughter’s soccer match at Leander High School in Leander, Texas (30 minutes north of downtown Austin) on the evening of February 23, 2016, something in the sky caught my eye around 6:15 p.m..  I was sitting about mid-field on the home side of the bleachers, which face northeast toward the away team side.  A former private pilot years ago and growing up in an aviation family,  I have always kept an eye on the sky and have a very good visual familiarity with planes of all sizes. I knew what I was tracking was not airplane at all.I surmise the object was a little lower than normal airliner cruising altitude, somewhere between 20,000 to 25,000 feet above ground level.  It did, however, appear to be about the size of an airliner, but there were no wings.  Given this, I would say that the object was “cigar” shaped and rounded on both ends.  It was also, in my estimate, not flying at airliner speed, approximately 500 mph.  I would say that it was going only about 1/3 – 2/3 normal airline speed.  It appeared to be white or metallic as an airliner appears, but again lower, slower, and with no contrail.  It was tracking across the sky in a straight line traveling roughly north northeast to south southwest.  I was able to watch it for two minutes or better before I lost it behind height of the bleachers. That I know, no one else around me noticed the object. I didn’t mention it to anyone because I happened to be seated between away team parents that I don’t know.I have seen weather balloons at high altitudes track across the sky in a very slow fashion, but they’re little what dots in the sky. Some I’m confident it wasn’t one of those. To be honest I’ve never in all of my years of watching the skies seen anything like this – with one exception. In early April 2015, my youngest daughter and I went to an airshow at the little airport in Burnet, Texas, about an hour’s drive west from our home in Leander. At some point as little Pitts Special aerobatic light plane completed a round of stunts with smoke, I notice something not quite right in the sky. I would say this object was at or above normal airliner cruising altitude, approximately the size of an airliner, and tracking slowly. This object was white/metallic like an airliner, except the shape is what I can only describe as “bowtie.” Looking at Google Earth, I would say that this object was moving west to east as I was standing looking north down the runway. In either case, I would definitely say neither object was a standard plane/airliner or any weather balloon that I’ve observed. They could possibly be drones or experimental aircraft.

I went back to bed.At 6:11am, I got up to see if the cloud cover had dissipated but it was still present so the planetary alignment was still not visible.  There were no pulsating red or white lights in the distance either. The cylindrical shaped object was gone.  No cell tower was visible either.

The temperature had dropped down to 71 degrees and the wind was blowing east by southeast 10mph (you can hear it in the footage). As my girlfriend and I were turning towards our car she stopped and pointed. I turned and looked to find four lights hovering past or behind the Estrella Mountains level with the mountain tops, in front of the visible cloud streaks to the southwest.  They were reddish, amber, gold color.  At first, I thought they were typical airline traffic approaching due east to land at Sky Harbor International Airport.  But these lights hovered—almost flickering—maintaining their position.  We could not determine if they were balls of fire, or that the space between us and the objects seemed to flicker because of the atmospheric particles between us and the lights.  Then, to the left, a reverse C crescent formation of seven lights a! ppeared roughly two minutes later.  Then, a single light appeared below the crescent—that is when my girlfriend began recording.  At this point there were 11 visible glowing objects.

2084,"My husband and I finally had a night to ourselves while the kids were at their grandparents; house.  We both love to star gaze and decided to do so after leaving a friend's house.  We drove to our favorite secluded spot almost exactly one mile from our home.  Upon arriving, we turned off the truck and headlights.  We immediately noticed a green light about 2 and a half to 3 feet above the ground.  We both noticed after a few seconds that it was moving.  It was moving in such a way that it looked like it was a bobble head.  The terrain in this field is bumpy and could be an explanation for this movement.  Anyhow, we keep watching in awe at this green light moving.  It made no noises at all.  We then notice that it's moving toward us.  I immediately get freaked out and want to leave.  My husband who is more curious than I am, decides to get out his spotlight to shine on this green orb light to see what it is.  Oddly, when he shines his bright spotlight on it, it starts re! tracting.  Still looking ""bobbily"".   We know that it was retracting because the light was getting smaller and you could visibly tell it was moving backwards.  He stops shining the light on it and it would start coming back towards us.  It was like this green light was ""scared"" of the bright spotlight. He did this off and on for about 10 minutes.  While we were sitting there his truck dash lights and headlights flickered a few times and it made a clicking sound when the lights flashed.  The truck was off and had been off since we pulled up.  Before I could convince him to leave he took pictures of the green light.  We left. We returned at daylight and could see these very narrow tracks in the same spot we saw this light.  I will also add that there are no houses within 200 yards either way where this light was.  There were also no vehicles or other people around.  I also want to add to this that the reason I wanted to leave after shortly arriving is because I felt t! hreatened some how by this green orb light.

2085,"Bright white with rotating colored lights-blue/red/green, silent, stationary. Visible with naked eyeSpring of 2015, I went outside about midnight & saw what I guessed was the brightest star ever.  Then I could literally see rotating colored lights-blue/red/green.  It was spaced between a ""V"" in a tree in our yard & off to the Southeast.  I went inside and looked for binoculars, thinking the object would probably be gone by the time I was back.  It was probably 15 minutes, but the object had not moved from the V spot I had marked it at.  It was disc circular and I could see the flashing lights very well with my binoculars.  I went inside again & text my daughter (in another state).  When I went back out-it was still in the same position but closer.  Close enough it scared me.  I went in & stayed in.  It reappeared the next few nights & I showed my husband and family members.  A few days later, news reporters were telling this story about the number of people who saw it.  Last night, Feb 19, 2016-my husband & I went out around 12:45 am and he said ! ""Your UFO is back.""  It was.  We went and retrieved binoculars to see the UFO with the bright white center and lashing multi colored lights.  It seemed further than in the previous Spring, more Southeast than before, but very visible not only with the naked eye but with binoculars as well.  It never really moves, & we never hear any sounds.

2086,"Erratic lights seen which exchanged position and flashed out and on again.At 10pm last night, 2/18/16, I observed two points of light jumping around a small portion of the sky.  A red light at 2:00 o'clock and a white light at 8 o'clock if we use the clock face illustration.  When I first focused my binoculars on them they immediately exchanged positions -the red went to the 8 o'clock position and the white to the 2:00 position.  Then they began do jump back and forth like for 30 to 45 seconds.  I could not tell if the moved between the intervening spaces or if they disappeared and re-appeared.  It was happening too fast to adjust my eyesight.  At one point the white light seemed to the circle the clock face.  I had to look away after 45 sec or so because it was straining my eyes.  I couldn't track one light without it becoming the other, but they seemed to return those same clock positions, and pause for a second or two.  This was the ultimate in watching erratic lights in the sky.  I don't know what the point of this activity would be, other than to attract attention and ""show off"".  I looked away again and looked back and the red light seemed to be lower in the sky, and the white light was higher, as if the clock face moved 15 degrees higher in the sky.  I went back and forth to the window for about twenty minutes and the 2 lights were still there, but ""dancing"" more slowly at the end.  I stopped watching before they disappeared.  Up to last night I had only witnessed white lights like this--the color red was new to my skywatching.

We both stopped dead in our tracks and I scrambled for my cellphone to take video.  Typically if I see a plane or a satellite, I don't bother even looking for more than a moment as they are very common in my area.  However once what i thought to be a satellite at first slowed down then stopped I had to take a closer look.  Just as i began recording the video the object starting moving as if it never stopped.  There were several small aircraft in the night sky and they're were on their normal flight paths.  It was clear and there were many stars.  Just as the main object started to fade in the distance the object which was just a brilliant white ball of light disappeared over methuen ma just a few miles in the distance but not before a smaller and less luminous object appeared directly above me and my friend.  This object flew quickly over head and was heading south of Salem.  I've seen simular objects before mostly satellites, however these objects were not characteristic of a satellite or high altitude aircraft.  I've been an observer for 18 years and wouldn't report anything that i felt was typical.  After the second object appeared it faded off into the distance.  I checked this site to see if anyone else had any sightings in New Hampshire and they did.  Not exactly  the same as what i saw but ufos have a funny way of changing their appearance.

The craft was larger than an airplane, had a defined shape to the nose and leading edges  of the narrow straight shape. The altitude was hard to determine (but an educated guess is between 3,000' and 5.000') due to the nature of the semi cloaked image. The speed at which this object was moving was very quick at approx. 25 MPH in a motionless, windless sky!

There were no high level clouds the night sky, and the intensity of the light was the same as what you would see when Venus is in its lower levels on the horizon.The only possible explanation I have is that it was the ISS, but according to NASA website, its track should have been further to the west of our location, at that time.Do you have someone who can confirm the exact position of ISS at the given time?

2111,"Bright pair of white lights south of Phoenix areaOn Coast to Coast Am just now, Peter Davenport said reports of lights near Phoenix area were reported, and may be flares from nearby military test range.  I have seen very bright pairs of white lights 2 nights this past week, on 2/16 & 2/17.  I am a truck driver and regularly drive between Tucson & Phoenix on my graveyard shift.  This took me driving west on I-10 between 9:30pm & 10:30pm on both those nights.  On the 16th, I looked to my left around the McCartney Rd exit near Casa Grande, AZ, to see 2 very bright white lights.  As I have seen strange things in the night skies many times, I looked to see if there were any blinking lights to show they were aircraft, and I saw none.  I looked again maybe 20 seconds later and one of the lights was gone.  After this I payed close attention to the remaining bright light for 3 or 4 more minutes and saw it quickly fade away to dim then gone.  I assumed this was a flare from test range beyond the mountains in the direction I was looking.  The next evening, around the same time, I again saw 2 bright lights next to each other in the sky around the same area of I-10.  Curiosity had me pay greater attention to both then the previous night.  After maybe 5 or 6 minutes, I again saw one dim then quickly go out, but maybe 20 seconds later flared back bright again for maybe 10 seconds, the instantly out again, and within 2 to 3 seconds, the 2nd light disappeared almost instantly.  These again, I assumed were military flares, which is why I did not report them to you here.  I am only now doing so, as it was mentioned on C2C.  Your reports may have come from Phoenix, in which case they would be reported to south, instead of west, of Casa Grande.

I looked up and saw a light in the sky.  I almost dismissed it as an airplane, but looked again and realized there were several lights all very near to each other.  When I later counted there were nine in the photos and video.  The lights were reddish/orange and did not change.  There was no noise that would usually be associated with aircraft and they were moving very slowly.  They were only visible for a couple minutes before disappearing behind clouds.  I did not see them reappear after that. I was able to get two photos and a short video of the lights.Having spent several years in the USAF, I have personally witnessed aircraft that is capable of hovering and flying at very slow speeds, but I’ve never seen this many flying so close together in this kind of formation.  I am aware of a government facility of some kind nearby that is not on maps.  My husband and I made a wrong turn shortly after moving to the area and came upon a guarded gate.

2177,"Light beings bring ships onto sand @ Ft. Lauderdale BeachI was at Fort Lauderdale Beach with four of my friends, around 11 P.M., on February 12, 2016.  In the sky there was a lot of bright stars and what we thought was a planet.  This “planet” gave off a light light that was shining so bright the surface of the ocean lit up.  There also seemed to be a large amount of incoming planes from over the horizon, which were also reflecting light off the water.  (Airplanes do not have lights that bright.) More “planes” kept coming and they kept getting lower.	We soon realized that these were ships morphing into and disguising as our crafts. We could see it happening.  All of the lights began coming closer and brighter.  I saw the light that looked like a planet come from high in the sky to low and it slowly moved towards us.  Once it got close, it looked like a huge military ship, but it was translucent.  It gave off both blueish and redish glows.  Within the huge ship were several small light beings that seemed to control the ship.  They got so close that the ship was coming onto the sand.  We receded back to the parking lot and it kept coming closer. It remained hovering stationary for about 15-20 minutes.	This being was within 10 feet of us.  We didn’t know what to do and we were all trying to process what we were seeing.  I was really worked up and excited.When I left, I felt like the beings had contacted me telepathically (but I can’t speak for the others).  I didn’t hear a voice, but it was like my brain received a message.  I knew that the thoughts I had about the way they felt came right from them.They told me they had the power to do ANYTHING and they are invincible.

The light was about 100 feet above the tree tops and it was red, but then would turn white.  It looked like it was spinning rapidly.  I walked further down the road almost into the next state as I like right on the border of new hampshire.  The object started to move back and forth slowly and as it did that i noticed that it moved up and down.  It got really bright for a moment and then really dull to the point that it was almost faded completely out.  I became really tired all the sudden and felt like i should go home.  As i did i noticed a car pull off to the side of the road.  An older man got out and was looking at the light.  He was to far away for us to speak and it was dark so i did not want to approach him as i thought a young man popping out of the dark side street would probably cause alarm.  I took a picture with my cell but it only showed up as a little red and white dot that you need to zoom in to see.  So as i finally finished up my walk i noticed that it faded out and i fell like the whole event wasn't important.  I decided to report it anyways because this was my first ufo sighting and i didn't want to let my experience go to waste.  p.s. I've never felt this tired before I'm in my 20's and run track still.

The flashing rainbow light just stayed in that same general area dimming and flashing rainbow and kind of bobbing around as far as I know all night.

After about 30 mins of those small planes checking out the flashing raindow light 2 large (mostly blacked out) helicopters came flying over and started checking out the flashing light for a while as well.  Once the helicopters started to leave and the small planes started heading back, off to the SE-E direction I noticed another flashing rainbow light as well as a 3rd one farther off, and almost directly above my location I noticed a light like the flashing rainbow ones, except this one was instead brighteniging and dimming (in a flashing kind of sense) this deep, rich, radiant, bright, glowing Goldish/Yellow/Orange colored light(same triangular shaped craft as the flashing rainbow light  craft) instead of rainbow like the others.

Having watched the lights the night before for twenty minutes I predicted that the second light, the one that appeared to be a little closer to us, would blink out in a minute or two, followed by the first light about a minute later.  We speculated what it might be, pointing out how it couldn't be an airplane and was really bright for a drone (and the color would be hard to make, being that drones presently shine LED lights) and other theories.

The size, shape and color of light it produced looked as though it was a satellite like so many I had seen before moving across the night sky; but it was very apparent that it was not.  The reason being is that this light producing object had a very distinct ring around it.  The ring could be described as something like a bubble, halo or a type of force field around it.  The longer I watched it the more interesting things got.  The movement seemed to slow and as it did, the ring became larger and larger until it seemed to dissipate except for the right side that looked as though it was shooting air or some kind of gas from within the object.

It was too dark to discern the shape of the fuselage, however I assumed that it was a jet.  I was taken aback as to how low it was flying, and how unusually slowly it was traveling.It crossed overhead and was not easily seen on my heavily wooded street.  For a brief second I thought about taking a photo, but my phone was in my purse behind the seat.  I figured it would be too late and too dark by the time I got to it.I continued to drive 1 mile out of my neighborhood, and more than 2 minutes passed when I came to the clearing on Hillcrest Road at the exit 40 overpass for Route 78.

I guess it comes from always wanting to know what kind of plane was flying over head.  Hey, I was a cold war baby.OK so now to what I saw this morning.Looking up into still very dark morning sky, many stars still quite bright and visible, and just at the head of a vaporous string of light clouds moving to east, I noticed two perfect illuminated semi circles creating a broken full circle of light moving together as if facing each other.  They were traveling South West directly overhead, over Gresham, at a very consistent rate of speed.That broken but perfectly shaped semi-circle expanded slowly until it reached a consistent point, that if it was, let’s say at 70,000 ft, would be three or four hundred yards across.  Off to side there was a flash of bright but contained light.  Almost as if a large star just appeared and then disappeared.The broken semi circle of illuminated light kept moving in it’s original direction.  The bright flash of light happened again but this time in front of the moving broken semi circle.  The light again seemed to disappear.  But then reappeared almost immediately at the head of the the forward part of the semi circle.  At this point in the dark morning sky there were no illuminated vaporous clouds that were visible in the slightly to the north sky when I first noticed this phenomena.The trailing part of the semi circle band of vaporous light just disappeared and the forward semi circle now reshaped itself into a strange funnel shape as if illuminating directly out of the bright star like light, but off to it’s side - in a different orientation then it’s preceding travel shape.Both the bright star-like light and the funnel vaporous light traveled together in the same South West direction and then both instantly disappeared for no apparent reason.I would like to back up and rephrase that when the leading semi circle changed it’s shape and orientation, it’s shape defied what one would think of as either a light illuminating out into the atmosphere or a plane’s light or illuminated rocket exhaust.Imagine a star moving that had a headlight shining off to side at an angle but the light pattern was semi thick for several hundred feet as it moved away from bright light and then mushroomed out in a strange pattern and at the end point of it’s beam and made a perfect concave semi-circle.  Almost as if it was a strange, physics defying light that was illuminating an invisible perfect circle, while moving.  Again, the concave pattern at the end of this vaporous light range stopping as if it was illuminating an invisible large circle off to the back and side of this bright star-like light.I have never seen anything like it in all my years.",Duration:4 minutes,"Location: Gresham, OR",Occurred : 2/10/2016 05:15  (Entered as : 02/10/16 05:15),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/10/2016 7:07:52 AM 07:07,Shape: Light
2229,"Large circular craft flew silently over man walking his dog.At around 5:15 am in the morning on February 10th, I took my puppy outside so she could go to the bathroom.  As I stood on my lawn, I looked up at the sky.  It was still dark and the stars were out.  It was a nice, quiet morning.I glanced up at the northeast sky and was startled to see two white orbs about 20 degrees above the horizon.   My immediate reaction was “what in the heck are those things?”  They looked about half a mile away.  They were stacked vertically (one above the other).  The objects had a fuzzy quality.  It was like viewing something through fog.  Even though the sky was clear.  They were moving silently in my direction at about the speed of a sailboat.At a distance it looked like two objects, however as it approached it appeared to be a single object.  It was difficult to see the whole thing, as if it was partly invisible.  It was either dark colored and therefore blended in with the black sky or it was transparent in parts.  It was odd, like looking at a jellyfish-- parts of it seemed transparent and parts of it appeared solid.As it glided overhead I got a good look at the underside of it. The center was the most distinctive and clear thing that I could see.  The outer edges were barely visible and dark.  The center was a bright white light that was triangular in shape.  There was another circular white light in the center of the triangle. The lights were steady, not blinking or flashing.   I drew a picture of what it looked like (attached).The sides of the triangle in the center were not exactly three straight lines as pictured (I’m not that handy with drawing tools).  It had three corners, but the sides of the triangle were bowed-in by the arcs of the circular things surrounding it.  As you can see in my drawing, there were several faint circles that seemed to make up the perimeter of the craft.  The dot in the center of the triangle was also white but distinctive from the white triangle.  I believe it was a little darker.As it moved overhead, I pulled out my cell phone and tried to record some video.  However when I checked the video later, it was too dark and nothing came out in the recording. The object was pretty big, about the size of a large dinner plate held at arm’s length. It made no sound at all.  It was difficult to judge its altitude.  I would guess less than 500 feet.The object continued on its straight path, heading southwest (bearing about 210 degrees).  I lost sight of it behind the trees on my property.  The entire event lasted about 30 seconds.This is the 2nd time I’ve seen something strange like this in the sky.  The first was on 9/9/2015 from the same location (which I reported to your web site).  However, in that case the objects were red, white, blue, and orange.I have no idea what this thing was.  It was too large and quiet to be a drone, and it wasn’t an airplane.",Duration:30 seconds,"Location: Lebanon, OR",Occurred : 2/10/2016 05:15  (Entered as : 02/10/16 05:15),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/11/2016 4:31:28 PM 16:31,Shape: Circle

2232,"T shaped craft traveling offshore that was absolutely not a helicopter or airplane of any sortAt approximately 5:15am, I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO traveling in a SW direction over Newport, Oregon.  I was located roughly 3 miles south of the local municipal airport and was outside stargazing before going to sleep, when I noticed a light and what appeared to be the underside of a vehicle lit from below traveling overhead.My first instinct was to get excited, thinking I was viewing the ISS traveling past. I knew that at those altitudes, they are usually still lit by the sun while other areas are in pitch black.  I then realized that this object in no way resembled the ISS and would have been far smaller if it were.Being near the municipal airport, I then tried to guess if it was a plane or helicopter, but the object consisted of a single light (approximately as bright as Sirius) and a main body that split into a “T” shape that appeared lighted from below.  It seemed to be traveling low, but there was no sound at all – we normally have helicopters flying overhead and can hear them very clearly, especially when all other daily traffic is gone.  The “T” shaped section was moving approximately 30-45 degrees off axis, so I knew it could not be a plane.Located along the coastal highway, I watched as this object moved into the tree line.  I was unable to grab a picture with my camera phone, so I jumped in the car to a lookout point along the ocean about .5miles away.  By the time I pulled in and got out (about 2 minutes max) it had already disappeared, having flown off over the water in a west-southwest direction.I’m a scientist for Oregon State University, and have seen many type of aircraft, but this was nothing I know about.

Took pics as best I could, then sat back down.  1 min later 4 more appeared coming from the same area moving together Orange/red in colour , all crafts were flashing here and there.  Disappearing and shining again.  Took more pics and watched them disappear exactly the same as the others.  I took the pictures using an iPhone 5 s.  They look light in photos and streetlight and trees made it harder to get a good picture.Hoping someone else in the area saw them and maybe got a better view.I have never posted or seen anything worth reporting before.Thanks",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Maple Ridge (Canada), BC",Occurred : 2/8/2016 23:00  (Entered as : 02/08/16 23:00),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/8/2016 12:38:34 AM 00:38,Shape: Unknown

2256,"2 twin spheres of orange light encircle airport, state trooper helicopter take off and chaseI was heading west on route 22.  I first noticed the two orange spheres (one above the other) on the far west side of the airport when I was driving past the exit before airport rd. airport road on the north side of 22 is where the airport (west side)Lehigh - Northampton Airport Authority / 3311 Airport Road/Allentown, PA, 18109 /1-800-FLY-LVIA and the state trooper barracks m (east side) is located.  Trooper Address: 2930 Airport Rd, Bethlehem, PA 18017 Trooper Phone:(610) 861-2026.At a distance, when I first noticed them, they didn't catch my attention as anything out of the ordinary.  I used to live in an apartment complex behind me a ways and I saw air traffic all the time. But as I got closer I realized these two things had no body to them, also as a side note there was zero air traffic going on before, during, or after the event.  The best I could see them because of trees getting in the way, they were encircling the airport complex from the west side over the south side and hangar area to where I was on the southeast side right above the corner of the complex near the clover leaf ramps.This is the only part I'm going to go out on a limb with because at the moment I pulled off on the side of the road on the exiting ramp, the two objects which had been moving quickly had now nearly stopped. the bottom object just before this.. sorry I should mention they had been in a uniform position together up to this point one above the other.. the bottom object had broken away from the top one and was moving about just a little bit, going out and coming back into this formation.  As they had slowed way down to almost now hovering a good football field height above the ground and almost the same distance away from me at about a 2'o clock from my windshield, out of the corner of my eye to the north, right side of me through my passenger window, the state barracks m helicopter was lighting up and taking off of the pad.  I ""think"" these two objects with their slow down were responding to helicopter churning up and leaving the ground.  Of course, maybe.This is when I quickly unbuckled, shifted to the passenger seat, had my hand on the iPhone which was all wired up to the truck to listen to music.  By the time I had sat down and was looking out of the window these two objects had broke formation and were next to each other by perhaps 3 times the distance from one another as they were in the original formation. They were now on the north side of the field well past race street.  That's a distance of about a mile roughly in the 3 seconds it took me to switch seats and regain visual on them.  They then disappeared into the cloud bank. At the same time the helicopter was just banking in their direction and heading in that direction. After the banking,  the helicopter shut off all lights including any flashers.  They had no flashers even when they ""went after"" these things into the low cloud bank.I watched for a little while longer but I'm on a time crunch with my delivery and had to go. So two things before I finish..  One, the orange spheres were beautiful. the orange was like looking into a ball of sodium light.. but also, not like looking into a street sodium light..  The color was the same, except it had that alive/electric look to it that perhaps looking into the center of a lit sparkler would have.  They also had a red plasma/lightning rippling effect over the balls..  That's why it was twinkling when I saw them at distances.  There were other people that were not only pulled over like the two cars at the top shoulder of the ramp.. but the right lane of airport rd. heading north before the airport/barracks light had completely stopped under them.  I don't know why else these people would be stopped in either places. Like all of my experiences with this phenomenon, another one for the books.  Thank you Mr. Davenport for all you do.. remember, there are a lot of us out there that depend on you for what you do.  I believe this is one of the most important issues in our society. It's a huge shame so little of us are paying attention to it.  I promise to report everything I see from now on.  This job in the middle of the night gives me a huge chance to catch these things.

2260,"I was driving when I saw a strange plane-like object with a flashing light floating, then flying extremely slow and close to ground.	I was driving down a part of route 1 when I looked out the window and noticed some lights in the near distance in the sky.  There were two bright bluish-white lights on either side of the object, and then a flashing white light in the middle/front.  For a minute, I figured it had to be a plane - the two lights on either side and the flashing light looked almost exactly like how a plane would look flying at night, and I thought I could make out the shape of the two wings on either side.  But something was still really strange about it.	As I kept driving, I noticed the object seemed too close to the ground to be a plane.  York is only a town over from an airport, so it's not abnormal to see planes that aren't very high in the sky because they're taking off or landing.  But this object was WAY lower in the sky than any plane I've seen, so that really had me questioning whether it was actually a plane. Then, as I got even closer, I realized that if this thing was a plane, how could I have been getting so close to it. If this thing really was a plane, it would have been gone long before I could have even questioned whether it was a plane.  But I kept getting closer and closer to it. That's when I started thinking maybe it was some tower with lights (also not an uncommon thing to see, but not something I had ever seen on this road before).	When I finally caught up to it, I kept looking straight up at it and I thought it was a tower of some sort for sure. It didn't look like it was moving, so I thought ""case closed"".... Until it started matching my speed.  This is when I really started to freak out a little. Towers obviously don't move, but I have NEVER in my life seen a plane FLOAT and then go as slow as a car.  I also noticed that it had very similar plane-like features such as what looked like wings, but it also looked somewhat like it had multiple edges to it. What really got to me was the fact that I felt like it was almost following me.  It was moving almost exactly at the same speed as me and going in the same direction.  Then, I finally made a turn onto another road, and then I freaked out even more because the object started going in the same direction as me again! I was almost at my destination so I decided I would just wait until I arrived there to continue looking at the object. But, after only peeling my eyes away for a few seconds to look at the road, it was gone when I looked back.  When I finally got out of my car at my destination, I noticed a lot of dogs were barking and making noise, which only amplified the strange feeling. 	This experience was really strange and scary. A part of me wants to believe and on some level thinks that it was just some weird plane, but even tho I didn't see any weird beams or colored lights, I have NEVER seen any plane shaped or act like this before, and I definitely have never seen a plane disappear into thin air within a matter of seconds.",Duration:3-5 minutes,"Location: York, ME",Occurred : 2/8/2016 19:00  (Entered as : 02/08/16 19:00),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/9/2016 7:44:47 PM 19:44,Shape: Other

It was headed east [off the ocean] within 45 second it cross the Palos Verdes peninsula [20 miles]. It then landed bottom of the Palos Verdes hill.The Lights- Typically all FAA aircraft have blinking light[s] of some sort not solid bright light. also, The distance from me was approximately 10 miles and these lights were quite large. I'm down in Hermosa Beach often and it is very common to see helicopters overhead. This object's lights were larger that helicopter lights.Speed- The object traveled approximately 20 miles within 45 second then came to abrupt stop to then drop down straight down.  Although it didn't seem high off the ground it was just about parallel with the top of Palos Verdes which has a elevation of 1457ft.

2264,Was approximately 13:00 give or take a few min. I was standing outside.  The sky was very clear except for some downward looking wisps about 5 of them separated equally with the same size of separation as their actual size and they were positioned North North West of my location as well as being the actual geographicly.it was as I was looking at this particular formation I noticed 2 high flying birds possibly hawks in the same area. It was then that I saw something just silently hauling ass in a near perfect westward direction. At first I thought it must be a third bird but I also noticed it was lighter in color and seemed to be moving incredibly fast and like I mentioned in a perfect line westward. I spent a few seconds trying to focus on better on the object I couldn't tell if it was small or larger and further away or at a much much higher altitude than a normal passenger aircraft. I've been in the military and it did not resemble any fighter jet mannerisms! at all. Upon continuing to focus in i could see the shape almost disc saucer like but more like a streamed down shape of an egg laying in its side almost like a sleek teardrop on its side fat end would be the rear end and point would be the front.  There was no chemtrail or exhaust if you will.  This had to all of it take less than a minute of actual viewing of the craft. Like I stated it was hauling ass and so perfectly straight.  That stood out to me a lot for some reason.  The craft also was a light grey/silver in color it seemed and I also recall that it had that metallic sheen to it somewhat reflecting the sun light to some small degree and it was doing so correctly in relation to the sun's current position in the sky.  It actually took longer for the facts of what I saw to finally click than the event itself lasted lol.  It was incredible plain sight clear day..  I only wish I had grabbed my phone camera but it was so so fast the moment would have been lost trying to fumble! with the phone and zooming in etc.  It's memory was so vivid and intense that I just had to find out if anyone else saw it and I've never thought of reporting one let alone seeing one.

2274,"Two spheres move in unusual ways in early morning.I just had my very first, truly authentic UFO sighting today at 5:52 am.  I awoke for no particular reason this morning and was staring out the large bay window that dominates my bedroom and faces the Southwest.  Had been starring out this window for a few minutes, wondering why I had to wake up so early on my day off, when two relatively bright, white lights steadily appeared in the upper portion of the window.  There is a thick transom board that forms the upper sill for the bay windows below and is the base for the triangular window that is the top of the bay window group.The lights appeared from behind this board, up into the large, clear portion of the triangular window, slowly moving upward and to the right for a short period.  At first, I thought it must be a pair of light aircraft, but it was weird that they would track so steadily with each other and move so slow.  I really didn't think too much of it, I had seen similar things in the past that weren't too far out of the realm of normality, but when the lights seemingly halted, and rapidly shot upwards to tiny points of light (probably about a second to a second and a half) in a very gentle quarter twist motion), I was pretty sure I was not watching a pair of Cessna aircraft.The twin points of light glittered for about two seconds before one on the left just winked out and the one on the right shot across the window in a Northernly direction in about a quarter of a second,  After waiting a few minutes, keeping my eyes on that patch of sky to see if anything else manifested itself, I turned on the table lamp and noted the time of 5:52 am and got out my iPhone and verified the direction the window faced as South West.The lights were blue/white, steady (no-pulsing), tracked very steady and were unspectacular except for their astounding speed and precise action across the sky.",Duration:3-5 minutes,"Location: Culpeper, VA",Occurred : 2/7/2016 05:52  (Entered as : 02/07/2016 05:52),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/7/2016 6:29:10 PM 18:29,Shape: Sphere

All of a sudden, I started seeing very bright multicolored lights, at first just one at a time, moving from west to northeast quickly.  I mentioned to my wife if she had noticed this?  Her comment was it may just be a reflection off our gutter from passing cars down the street.As the time passed, I kept seeing more and more of these bright, fast moving, multicolored orbs following the same flight path and quickly ran outside for a closer look.  Once I got outside, I noticed a steady stream of the orbs, sometimes in groupings of four or five at a time, moving across the sky.  Now our weather here in Akron, while cold, was perfect.  Crystal clear skies last when I observed this amazing event.

2283,"Two satellite looking objects stopping, reversing, rotating and changing direction before disappearing in the distance.To give some background on our sky-watching experience, my 14-year-old son and I have spent a great deal of time watching satellites in the evenings.  Over the last five years, we have spent 1-2 hours lying on a blanket in our back yard having contests to see who can spot the most satellites.  We have done this on a total of at least 50 separate occasions.  I am also registered on the Heavens-Above web site.  I have taken printouts of satellite and rocket passes outside with us and waited for the passes to occur.  We have watched rockets tumble, which look like a blinking satellite as the sun reflects off the different surfaces of the rocket.  We have watched Iridium Flare and International Space Station passes as well.  To summarize, my son and I know what we are looking at.  We understand the difference between an aircraft and a satellite passing overhead.  Well, at least that’s what we thought, until the evening of February 6th, 2016.We were skiing at Blue Knob Ski Resort, located approximately 6 miles west of Claysburg, PA, at an altitude of 3120 ft.  The sun set shortly after 17:30.  At approximately 19:00, we were on the Route 66 ski lift traveling slowly in a southwesterly direction.  I was sitting on the left and my son was sitting on the right.  The sky was completely clear and dark.  With unlimited visibility, I commented on how beautiful the night sky was because of the lack of light pollution compared to where we live, which allowed us to see many more stars than we would normally see.Just as we were passing over the Upper Extrovert ski trail, my son said “Oh my God!  Look at those two satellites traveling together, side by side” as he pointed in a southeasterly direction.  I looked in the southeasterly direction to where my son was pointing, near the constellation Orion.  At approximately 80 degrees from the horizion, I immediately saw what looked like two satellites with a brightness magnitude of approximately -1 traveling in a northerly direction.  The distance of the two objects from us seemed to be the same as a typical communication satellite just outside of the Earth’s atmosphere.  The brightness magnitude of the two objects remained constant throughout this entire observation.   There were no audible sounds from the two objects whatsoever.  The two objects were separated by about 10 degrees and traveling approximately two to three times the velocity of a normal satellite.  The distance between the two objects was decreasing and after approximately 4 seconds, I was expecting the two objects to pass over each other.  Instead, the two objects remained closely together and continued to travel in a northerly direction for another three to four seconds.  The two objects, very smoothly, in approximately two seconds, decelerated to a stop.  It was very clear that they came to a stop because the large number of stars surrounding the two objects gave us a good point of reference.  After approximately one second of both objects hovering still, they smoothly and slowly reversed direction and traveled a short distance of approximately 1-2 degrees in a southerly direction for approximately three to four seconds.  Both objects slowly and smoothly came to a stop and hovered for approximately two seconds and simultaneously rotated so that the object on the west exchanged positions with the object on the east.  Both objects, very smoothly, began to accelerate in a northerly direction at a rate of acceleration that took both my son and! myself by surprise.  It only took approximately two seconds for both objects to accelerate to a velocity of two to three times that of a typical communications satellite.  We continued to watch both objects travel in a northerly direction for approximately ten seconds as the distance between the two objects increased to approximately 10-15 degrees.At this point, as we continued to slowly travel in a southwesterly direction on the ski lift, the bright metal halide lights from the Mid-Way Station drop off point coupled with the increasing distance of the two objects from us prevented us from continuing our observation of the objects.As this observation was occurring, my son and I were verbalizing our observation to each other as we started to realize that what we were witnessing was something we have never seen before.  We were cursing and yelling to each other as we described what we were seeing.  I said things such as “What the heck?!” as my son shouted, “Oh, my God!  They stopped!”  I shouted “Oh my God!  They’re going backwards!”.  These type of statements mixed with a few choice curse words were uttered throughout the entire observation.As we passed the Mid-Way drop off station, my son and I were in shock as we sat in stunned silence for an unknown amount of time.  Now that we were in a fully illuminated area, I turned to my son and he turned to me.  We locked eyes for a few seconds.  My son broke the silence with “What was that?”  I returned “I don’t know.” We continued to the top of the mountain in stunned silence.We made one more trip down the mountain and decided that we would call it a day since neither of us could concentrate on skiing.",Duration:25 seconds,"Location: Claysburg, PA",Occurred : 2/6/2016 19:00  (Entered as : 02/06/16 19:00),Posted: 2/11/2016,Reported: 2/7/2016 9:25:44 AM 09:25,Shape: Light

2285,"Dull orange orb over Petaluma, CA, for over five minutes 2/6/2016, a portion of which was a very bright, fiery orange.While sitting on my sofa watching the Golden State Warriors game against the Thunder, saw a dull orange circular object appear through the window in the southeast.  Walked outside to see what it was and this orange orb was slowly moving in a generally southeasterly direction.  It had a brighter portion which was about 10% of the total size of the object and that part was slowly rotating in an irregular pattern around and through the object.  Grabbed my binoculars out of the car and was able to see clearly that that brighter orange glow rotating continued and in trying to identify it the only thing that it was remotely like was a large balloon with a gondola slung underneath it.  In this case though, the gondola was on fire as it was significantly brighter than the rest of the object.  But the way this brighter portion was moving was not predictable and did not have an obvious pattern or rhythm to it.  The dimmer portion of the orb looked to have a semblance of a grid-like appearance, but when the brighter portion of the glow moved across the face of it, the grid was no longer visible due to the greater intensity of the light.After about four minutes of relatively slow and consistently paced movement from my right to left, it appeared to turn south and head toward San Francisco roughly.  It moved away at a regular pace for several seconds and then appeared to speed up significantly until it became too small to view and then disappeared.  The speed of this last part seemed unlike anything that I've seen before, as though the physics I am aware of were no longer operating on this object.  The disappearance from view in the last ten seconds essentially happened too fast to be explained by any previous experience I've had.  There was no sound involved at all.This is the first time that I have ever seen, much less reported, anything like this.  Until I did a Google search on 'orange object in the night sky over Petaluma tonight,' I was unaware of websites like this.  I'm a totally sane person and this was in no way imagined.

On the night of February 05, 2016, at 8 pm in Cooleemee, NC, my wife and I stepped out of our house to walk the dog.  I was looking due west into the night sky when I noticed a dark mass moving slowly from north to south appeared to be following the South Yadkin river, I estimated that the object was no more that 100 feet off the tree tops and a half a mile away.  The object was very large but I was unable to discern a shape, my first thought was that it was a C-17 cargo plane.  I did not hear any engine noise and assumed that it would catch up as jet aircraft tend to be seen first then heard.  I stepped further up closer toward the road in my front yard to continue to walk the dog, when I saw another object traveling in the same direction at the same altitude and the same speed with no apparent engine noise.  I was still not able to determine the shape of the object but noticed that it had a single steady red light that was approximately 3 times bigger than a star.  In all there were 7 objects that we counted that passed us, all at the same altitude moving in the same direction at the same speed with no engine noise.  However, there were 2 objects that were different, the fourth object had in addition to the steady red light, had a white light, towards the front of he object, shining directly down below the object and the fifth object had just the red light as the others did but had two slime green colored lights that were illuminated what appeared to be the upper aft section of the object.  I have spent the last 18 years working in Army Aviation Maintenance in the Avionics/Electrical section and immediately assumed that they were formation lights, so my initial impression was that they were military aircraft despite the lack of seeing an Anti Collision light illuminate on any of the objects.  As my wife and I stood there and watched them continue moving south, then south easterly,  I witnessed the last objects red light move thru the trees and disappear and during the entire sighting my wife and I never heard any engine noise.These data are preliminary and have not undergone final quality control by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

Then they started moving in together and as they did, the far right one when way up in the sky, and the left one started moving far left to where they made a huge triangle in the sky.  They stayed like that for about 3 minutes.  The top one disappeared upwards and the other two started moving to the far right and stayed together for a long time.  Then they would disappear and re-emerge.  It started getting light out and they all disappeared.

2312,"Red fog in room, blueish chrome disk outside of front door, buzzing and pop noise, weird behavior from wife and dog.   I was awoken from sleep by a presence in the room last night.  When I opened my eyes there was a red fog engulfing the entire room.  I tried to wake my wife up but she wouldn't budge.  Not even my dog who was sleeping on the bed would wake up.  Just like a vacuum, I watched the fog get sucked out of my bedroom door (which was open).  I was extremely scared but chose to run to my front door.  There was a slight buzzing noise coming from outside (sorry I'm getting goosebumps real bad just thinking about this).  I opened the door and looked up.  Not 50 feet above the ground was a blueish chrome disk sitting almost motionless in the air.  This was at night and it's weird how I was able to see the distinct blueish chrome color of the disk.  There was a slight wobble to it also.  I felt like something was staring at me.  The disk was about 30 feet around and had a small ""base"" on top of it.  There were no lights or markings on it.  It sat there for about! a minute or two (I think but it's almost like I had been staring at it for 15 minutes) and the buzzing noise stopped.   There was a pop that came from it (there go the goosebumps again) like a balloon popping and it slowly lifted straight into the air.  When it got about I'd say 100 or so feet up it faded out of sight into nothingness.  I ran back into my house to check on my 2 year old son and he was fine.  I was able to wake my wife up and asked if she had seen anything.  She got teary eyed and without saying anything went immediately back to sleep.  My dog almost looked sad and went back to sleep as well.  This by far is the weirdest and unnerving thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  I'm am scared s**tless since last night.  While I have seen ""UFO's"" in the sky before and reported them on this site, this again by far has confirmed my belief that something else is out there.

2317,"Eight large, slow moving, noiseless orange-red spheres traveling over Tucson evening sky.About 7:30 pm, I was taking groceries from my car into my home, when I looked south into the sky and saw two large (as compared to commercial jet or helicopter) red-orange colored spheres.  They were moving across the sky, west to east, but very slowly.  I could see no lights, typical to any aircraft flying at night, and I strained to hear any kind of aircraft noise and could not.  I watched them travel east and then sort of disappear or fizzle out.I continued with my groceries and then noticed two more of the same.  A few minutes later, two more and then two more came more quickly.  All had the same characteristics and moved slowly, almost as if floating across the sky.Just before the final four spheres crossed, another small aircraft came into the space from a more northwest direction.  However, the path of this plane took it right next to these spheres, so it had to have seen them as it passed two of them.The final four spheres also traveled slowly to the east before fizzling out. I thought maybe our Air Force base was doing some new kind of craft experiment or they were weather balloons.  The only different thing was that at the end, I believe I could see tiny lights around the spheres, very tiny, almost like diamonds or little stars, but they were moving, too.I emailed neighbors to see if anyone else saw what I did and one couple replied that they did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My first thought was, wait, there's not supposed to be a light there.  It was as large as if we holding a 50 cent piece at arm's length.  This was looking in a north/northeast direction and we're located in the Garden Valley area of Roseburg, outside of town.  I watched it go in a horizontal direction over the top of the mountain and then it was just gone.  I stood there for a few minutes and nothing else happened.  I look out on those hills every night and there's never been a light there.  There are no roads up to the hill where I saw it. When it moved horizontally, it would have moved away from the top of the hill.  So if it was some sort of land based vehicle it would have had to have moved diagonally down following the hilltop.  Also, when it disappeared, it wasn't because it went behind another hilltop,  it just vanish! ed.

2320,"I cannot believe I'm doing this but- what I saw I can certainly not say it was an airplane or anything reasonable.  Yesterday was really foggy in Colorado.  On my way back from Boulder, I saw at least 3 blocks from my house 3 red lights up in the sky but in a shape that would add up to the shape of a UFO.  I laughed at myself for thinking that but as I watched it it was going VERY fast for an ""airplane""  I thought it was a jet but the red spaced out lights made it look much bigger than that.  It was higher up in the sky and was traveling about (my guess) 6 or 7 times faster than an airplane.  The solid red lights started to blink rapidly and then rhe ""object"" literally went so fast to the right my eyes couldn't keep up with it.  It just ""BOOM"" flew to the right and was GONE.  I tried to search for some reasonable explanation for what this thing was.  It wasn't an airplane or jet so the only other thing I could think of was some sort of m! ilitary craft like those really huge ""silent bombers"" but where I saw this ""UFO"" is not anywhere near a military base.  And I gotta tell you (with my expierience living right next to a marine base) this did not move as fast as one of- what I saw.  So, to kind of wrap it up here, I do believe now that what I saw wasn't something that should have been seen, and I'm going to have a really hard time trying to unsee it.  But to make something clear, I think that there are oher planets out there- more- beyond our imagination, so maybe this thing that I saw is just an airplane to some normal people like us.

2325,"02/04/2016, Fresno, CA, Doughnut, 4-5 min, hovered, then landed super quick in front of vehicle, huge round craft, brown/gold, vanishedMr. X Documentary File # 00701  THE CRAFT This is to document the factual events that occurred on or about 02Apr16, at or about 1:40am, in Southern California in the city of Fresno.  The occurrence was witnessed by, and is conveyed by sworn testimony equivalent to, and with all judicial authority, as stated under oath by the signed witness, Mr. X.  There are several items preceding File #00701, including and limited to; one drawing of Object ABC articulated by Mr. X in the presence of a close kin.  After explanation to kin about Object ABC, Mr. X was asked by kin if he could draw, or recite details of Object ABC.  Mr. X did articulate the main features of Object ABC on an old small paper bag.  That image was then destroyed.  There is a second document articulated by Mr. X detailing the occurrence encountering Object ABC.As Mr. X was exiting the freeway into Fresno, California, using GPS from his phone as he navigated to his destination.  The GPS on the phone he was using began giving false readings, and performing out of its normal functional character.  Mr. X attempted to adjust the GPS as he drove on the off-ramp from Freeway 99 into Modesto, CA.  About 50 to 100 feet from completing the exit ramp, Mr. X saw a strange thing seemingly hovering off to the left of the exit over-pass.  As he began to focus on the object, the object seemed to flip, or slip, or shape-shift, landing in the middle of the road, on top of the over pass, directly in front of Mr. X’s vehicle.  He stopped the vehicle before running into the object.Mr. X stopped the vehicle, and tried to comprehend the sight of the huge craft, and make sense of what he was seeing.  He tried to wake his children, and co-passenger.  One 16-year old son sitting in the front passenger seat, one 14-year old son sitting in the rear passenger seat on the left side, and one female 18-year old female passenger sitting behind the driver’s seat.  All passengers were asleep at the time of the sighting.  Mr. X tried to wake everyone up, and even shook his son sitting next to him.  Mr. X began to speak aloud thinking that someone may be awake and listening, “what is it?  Look at this you guys.  What do I do?  I don’t understand.  What am I supposed to do?”  He asked.  When no one responded, he tried once again to wake his son, then decided to do something he thought might be stupid.  He thought that he couldn’t leave this moment without being absolutely sure that what he was seeing was real, and with no obstruction between his own eyes and the stran! ge object.  (He didn’t want to wonder in the future, because he knew he was seeing something that he never had seen before.)  He stepped out the vehicle with one leg, and stared at the huge object, with one hand on the door as he stood straight up.  He looked at the object for about what seemed to be 7 to 11 seconds, only looking into the vehicle for a split second at his passengers, and asking if they could wake up, then looking back at the object.  Just then a vehicle horn honked and when he looked back, he noticed there were two vehicles stopped behind him, and a third pulled off to the right.  The Third car was the vehicle that was honking.  At first, Mr. X thought that they were honking at him to get back in his vehicle before the strange craft did something to hurt him. (like he was crazy for standing out in front of the craft like that, so close.) Mr. X looked again at the craft as he got back into his vehicle, and as he clasped his seat belt, the huge craft just vanished in the plume of faint smoke or gasses, which quickly dissipated.  The Thing that Mr. X is calling smoke, or gassed, can a! lso be called a mist, and even visible fumes, or a cloud of something.  This action of the gasses had a visual effect something akin to a visible fume, without a smell, and was all around the craft.Mr. X then began to proceed the remaining 15 yards, or less on the off-ramp to the light.  He continued to look for the object, and look at his GPS to find his way.  The GPS still did not give correct magnetic north, flipping and changing routes sporadically.  He drove from memory, until calling his friend that he was going to visit, and having the friend guide him to his friend’s home.Mr. X pulled into his friend’s driveway in about 8 minutes after that.  As soon as Mr. X passengers began to awake, he began talking about the Strange Craft.  The first thing he said to his friend after saying a brief “Hi.” Was “I just saw an Alien Space Craft”.  The friend just thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking at all, and as Mr. X began to walk, he lost control of his legs, and became weak.  The friend had to hold Mr. X up and assist him in regaining balance.  The passengers, Mr. X, and the friend all entered the home, and went out back to sit in a rest area of the home for a moment.The Craft was huge, Brownish-Gold, with tints of Green, Red, and Lots of Black.  The texture was Hexed, or X / cross hatched, with some kind of braces running vertical along either side curving with the surface of the craft from top to bottom.  The braces were of the same color, and were about three and a half lanes apart, on either side from the center where I was.  The craft was about 50 to 60 feet high, and obscured at the top and sides with the strange black cloud, or fumes.  At the bottom of the craft, about a foot and a half off the ground was pitch black, where the outline of the craft could be seen as it hovered close to the road.  The craft did block the view of anything behind it, and the street under it.  The craft made no sound, and had no smell.  Just an eerie silence.  Mr. X did get out of the vehicle, and look at the craft with his own eyes, and he did have glasses on so he could see the craft very clearly.The craft did appear from hovering off to the left of the freeway, and did move very quickly (impossibly quick), and stopped on a dead stop in the center of the roadway.  The craft did vanish, with the gas or smoke leaving a few seconds after the craft vanished.  The roadway became clear and lit, and the yellow center, and white lane lines became visible all the way across the overpass, where Mr. X was to drive.This is the sworn testimony, and statement of Mr. X, who is identified yet requests to remain anonymous for as long as possible.  The events described within this report are true and accurate to the best of my recollection, and in in no way fabricated, or made-up.  I swear to what I saw, and I am MR. X.  I have no understanding for what I saw, and I know that the nature, and actions of this strange craft was not of anything that I have seen on Earth.I hope this report helps, as I was asked to document the events of the evening on which I saw this Strange Unidentified Craft.

There was absolutely no sound coming from the object and it appeared that the lights were like engines on fire.  It was very close to our location and yet it was not making any sound what so ever.  The far right light went out first.  The other three fiery lights went out at the same time within a micro second of the first.  I then witnessed two planes following each other to the west and turning quickly to the east in a formation that is not normal with the flight patterns of other planes in this area as if they were following something.  I knew that they were planes because of their flashing white lights.  The large opject that I witnessed did not display any flashing lights of any kind.  Only helicopters would fly like that and there was not a sound in the sky to indicate that was what the two flashing lights were.

2403,"Clear sky.  2 section, rectangular, 3 dimensional, silver, low-flying object, approx. semi trailer size.Sunny, clear, blue sky.  At approximately 2:00 PM, I was driving north on 65 highway and saw a silver shape in the sky ahead of me, to my northwest moving east.  I got closer to it and identified the shape as rectangular; proportions similar to a semi trailer or possibly slightly longer.  It was traveling slower than a helicopter and slightly higher than helicopters usually fly.  It was pretty low.The craft was sharp and clear.  Size, thumb at arm’s length would probably cover the height but not the length.  It seemed to have two sections.  The back section was the same height but only about ¼ or &#8531; the length of the leading section.  The sections were slightly separated although there was some sort of narrow bar between the sections connecting them. The rectangle was a burnished silver color.  The bottom was darker, I suppose because the sun was not shining directly on it.  Between the two sections it was much brighter except for the bar.  It either had a light source or perhaps it was the angle of the sun. I don’t know.  There were disruptions in the texture along the side of the front section.  They were indistinct.  They didn't look like windows but there was something different along the side in four or five noticeable areas.I took the sunshine street exit and while stopped at the traffic light at the bottom of the ramp, the object crossed my path about a quarter mile in front of me.  Nobody else seemed to see it and I was trying to catch another driver's eye to look up but I was unsuccessful.  I wanted to take a photo but there was no place to pull over so I decided to follow it by turning east on Sunshine.  I followed for about 3 miles impeded by traffic.  It was travelling in an ESE direction.  Sunshine goes directly east.  Soon I was looking at the back of it and it was pulling away from me.  There was traffic and no place to pull over until it was nothing but a silver spec in the sky.  It looked like it would cross hwy 60 just south of Rogersville.  At that point I was able to pull over.  I got out of the car and could no longer see anything of the object.

2422,"Analysis of ""sonic booms"" and shaking reported along New Jersey coast.This is an analysis of the details of a “sonic boom” event reported along the New Jersey coast and surrounding areas.  The shaking was reported to have occurred around 1:23:45 PM local time on January 28, 2016.  After initial reports of ground movement came in, the USGS determined this was not an earthquake, but originating in the atmosphere.  They estimated that as many as 9 sonic booms were reported, which the US Navy has since attributed to a supersonic flyover by two jets in Naval airspace, located approximately 14miles offshore.However, when one digs deeper, this explanation doesn't adequately explain the facts.  To clarify the details, I have included a diagram.  The diagram is based on the USGS ""Did you feel it"" map of the event, which recorded eyewitness shaking reports made to the USGS.  I should point out that people generally contact USGS to report an earthquake, not a loud sound.  In my personal experience with several low-altitude supersonic flyovers, I have heard a sharp sound/air blast, but felt no ground movement.  However, in this case, ground shaking was reported as far away as 70 miles from the Navy airspace, as shown on the map.The effects and range of sonic booms has been carefully studied.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately 1 statute mile (1.6 km) for each 1,000 feet (300 m) of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at 30,000 feet (9,100 m) will create a lateral boom spread of about 30 miles (48 km).  In this case, we have reports from as far away as 70 miles.  So if the sonic booms were generated offshore in Naval airspace, that means the boom width is twice that, or ~140 miles.  Plugging that value into the equation gives us an altitude of 140,000 feet.  This is more than twice the stated operational altitude of the F-35C, and 3.5X the operational altitude of the F-18.Therefore, I find it rather difficult to accept the official Navy explanation, as it simply does not explain all the observational data.  Even at first glance, it's hard to imagine how two small aircraft could displace enough air to cause ground shaking 70 miles away!  All the observational data should be considered to find a better explanation, wherever the facts may lead us.",Duration:90 minutes,"Location: Absecon (most reports), NJ",Occurred : 1/28/2016 13:23  (Entered as : 01/28/2016 13:23),Posted: 2/4/2016,Reported: 1/29/2016 3:00:06 PM 15:00,Shape:

I don't know how far away it was when I first saw it, but, I knew it was coming right at me.  I kept walking through the parking lot towards the door because I was a little scared.  As it got closer I could see a slow blinking green light on the left (if I would have been in the craft it would have been on the right) and slow blinking white light on the right.  It then went directly over my head.  There were four large static bright round white lights underneath.  They almost looked as though each of the lights were made up of two half round lights.  The lights were positioned like there would have been one in each corner of a rectangle.  I could not see the shape of the craft.  I was desperately trying to, but between the  bright lights from the craft and the light at the door I was standing at I couldn't see a shape.  Plus it was also completely cloudy that morning so there was no light above it.  There are large trees there, probably 60 to 70 feet tall.  I estimate the craft to have been 700  to 800 feet up.  It was not flying high.  What freaked me out most was the lack of noise.  It was a very soft sound of air moving as it flew above me.  As it moved away, I saw a slow blinking red light.

I was heading home which is further out on the southern edge of Buckeye.  It took me approx. 10 minutes to get to my street and the lights were still hanging in the sky.  I decided to drive down a country road in that direction to see them better.  I thought I could get closer to them, however after driving a few more miles it seemed I wasn't getting any closer so they must've been further away than I thought.  They were fading in & out and re-appearing either in the same spot as they disappeared in or they re-appeared in a different spot.At one point I saw  a couple of small lights develop out of one of the bigger ones and hung at the same altitude horizontally from the bigger one and then faded out.  They kind of reminded me of Christmas lights blinking but more randomly.  Sometimes they would all disappear and then return.  I did observe one of them very close to the ground.Interesting to note, before I became aware of these strange lights. I saw 2 military jets make a huge U turn around Buckeye flying over the area where I saw the lights, then the jets made a U turn and headed back towards the direction of the AF base.

As I drove closer and under the object, the light was less bright which meant to me it was pointing horizontally, eastward toward Columbia.  I didn't see any propellers or blinking side lights, which I looked for carefully.  On the back of the object, there was a dim red light circle, but it was dim and barely visible.  The best I can describe it is like a ring of LEDs being around a spare tire on a jeep--except the lights seemed continuous and dim.  Because this was after sunset, I tried to locate a pole or suspension wires for the object (although there aren't any other objects at that height).

I thought it might be a satellite that blew up, but certainly some celestial being very far away, just way thicker and green & blue, which I’ve never seen before.",Duration:5 seconds,"Location: Santa Fe, NM",Occurred : 1/23/2016 19:45  (Entered as : 01/23/2016 19:45),Posted: 1/29/2016,Reported: 1/24/2016 8:18:26 AM 08:18,Shape: Flash

I noticed that as the full moon inched above the treeline, the moon appeared very large.  I made comment about wanting a telescope to view it.  Minutes later I saw a black line crossing the face of the moon.

2496,"Two bright red circular objects.  Hovered brightly in one spot and then vanished.Approx 10:00pm in Concord, CA, my daughter and I were arriving home and facing north, when I noticed two circle objects that were a reddish orange.  They were different enough that I stopped the car and pointed them out to my daughter as possibly planets.  She loves hearing about the stuff that goes on up there and at 5 loves the telescope.  There were two when I first saw them and initially thought they were planets.  With so many planets in sight soon, it was my initial thought because they weren't stars, shooting stars or airplanes. Clearly.  Then as I looked closer, I noticed they were the same exact shape and looked to be the same distance from myself, so being planets seemed impossible and the size was a little too large for a planet.  One was a bit higher than the other one but directly on top of it.  It was an odd site at first.  They were bigger than an airplane and it never blinked green or any other color.  They both looked to burning brightly the more I looked at them, and luckily, there were planes in the sky that were somewhat nearby and those gave a quick way to compare and notice the obvious difference between the two.I then quickly parked my truck and took my daughter to walk back to where we could see them.  When we got back over there, it was maybe 1-2 minutes later, the highest one was gone and the lower one looked to be a little closer but pretty similar to its last position.   When looking at it, I felt like it was moving although its position in the sky wasn't really changing much.  It's hard to explain.  As I watched for another couple minutes, telling my daughter to watch it and pay attention, it didn't seem to brighten or dull much other than the thin, low flying clouds coming in between us at times, but never lost visiblility of it.  It sat there as bright as it had been and then quickly vanished.  I couldn't explain it and thought, maybe clouds, but quickly saw another airplane fly in the same direction and it affirmed to me that it wasn't clouds and the quickness in which it disappeared affirmed to me that it wasn't the clouds that made it disappear from site.  It wasn't an obstructed view, it disappeared from the sky.  Like it just turned off.Although it wasn't doing much, it didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen.

2500,"Several large orange lights hovering over South Jordan, UtahOn the night of January 21, 2016, I was leaving my place of employment on Riverfront Parkway, South Jordan, Utah, at shortly after 8 pm.  I exited out of the east side of the building and headed southward towards the parking lot.As I cleared the building, off to the right, something in the western sky caught my eye.  I looked over, and there, hovering over the farm behind my place of employment, were several orange lights.  They were rather large and flat in shape, each one comprised of a single light in the middle and two beams of light extending out on either side.The lights were hovering in a somewhat vertical formation that appeared slightly like a sideways W, and it quickly became obvious to me that they were not airplanes because they were not moving at all.  It also didn’t seem like they could have been helicopters because they were making no sound whatsoever, and they were close enough that had they been helicopters I would certainly have been able to hear them.Because the lights were holding so still it was impossible for me to tell if they were being produced by one single object with multiple lights, or if each light represented a separate object.As I stared at the phenomenon in front of me, my first inclination was to run back into the building and tell the other employees from my company that were still inside to come out and witness it with me.  But then I thought to myself that if I did that there’s a chance the objects might do something in my absence, and I would miss it.  So I decided to just stand there in the parking lot and observe.The objects continued to hover above the farm for what seemed like another couple of minutes.  Then, suddenly, as if there was some coordination between them, they began to move.  At this point it became obvious that I was not observing one single object, since they were clearly moving in relationship to one another.  The lights at the bottom of the formation began moving upward so they were more parallel with the ones at the top.The motion that these objects exhibited at that moment was different than I have ever seen from conventional aircraft, as some of them were actually moving diagonally.  The closest thing I can describe their motion to is that of fireflies.Then, as the objects at the bottom had reached a position where they were more parallel with those at the top, one by one they began to blink out.  Since it was dark, I couldn’t tell if they just turned their lights off, or if they actually disappeared.  But, bottom line, they were gone.I stood there for a moment, baffled, wondering what it was I just witnessed.  Then I got in my car and drove home.That weekend I pondered over the event.  I couldn’t think of a rational explanation for what I had seen, and I wished there had been someone else who had witnessed it with me.  Then, it occurred to me that maybe there was.  I recalled that my co-worker who sat next to me had left only about 30 seconds before I did.  Surely, I thought, the lights were there when he had left the building.So, the next time we worked together I decided to ask him if he had seen them too.  His response was an enthusiastic yes.  The reason I had not seen him out in the parking lot with me was because he had already gotten in his car and was watching the lights through his car window.We later had a chance to discuss the event more in detail.  His description of the event was very similar to mine:  The lights were hovering, then, after a couple of minutes, they began to move, and then disappeared.  While we were discussing our experience, the girl that sat across the aisle from us began to comment that she and some of her friends had had similar experiences, and I realized that this kind of thing is becoming far more common than it used to be.As far as what the explanation is for what I saw, I am torn.  Part of me thinks it could be evidence for extra-terrestrial life, but the more skeptical part of me thinks it could have been a clever hoax.  For now, the incident remains unexplained.",Duration:~3 minutes,"Location: South Jordan, UT",Occurred : 1/21/2016 20:02  (Entered as : 01/21/16 20:02),Posted: 9/22/2016,Reported: 9/16/2016 11:49:09 AM 11:49,Shape: Light

Another girl was standing watching and she said look at the color.  I said ya that is a UFO.

About a minute later, I saw something and asked if that's what he was seeing.  He said, ""Yes!""  At first I was skeptical.  It looked like a small odd shaped cloud, with a small, fat trail behind it.  I thought maybe it was a jet, but it was moving and in a strange way far off in the sky.  I lost it for a minute behind some trees and I ask my friend if it was gone and he agreed that it had just disappeared into thin air.  We were talking about what we saw when oddly enough a jet appeared from the area where the object had vanished and flew in a Southwest direction.

Then it moved back west the exact same path but only ¼ the way for about 3 seconds.It stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds and slowly descended at a much slower rate than when it was traveling east and west.

It was in a distance but I sat and watched it for 10 minutes - at first it was stationary but as I lined it up with the grid in the window I could measure its slight change of movement.  I asked my husband to look at it and he said at first glance that it was a star.  Then as he watched longer he saw it move.  He got the binoculars and said Wow- you got to see this!  It has five lights on it and it is hovering.  It had five lights in a row with the middle light being the largest  the lights changed colors from yellow green to red blue.  It looked really large way larger than a small airplane.  It hovered at a lower altitude until daybreak then it ascended higher into the sky.  It clearly looked like a star with the naked eye as it got higher in the sky.  It appeared that  the daybreak was what drove it higher in the sky.  We saw it make movements directly up - then quickly shifting side to side them down - it was really high in the sky still at 9:00 am but then cloud cover came and could not view it under the clouds anymore.  Really strange - it truly looked like in the alien movies - just like those spaceships with the lights.  We have never seen anything like this before!!   We will be watching the sky from now on.

2520,"Stargazing at 3am... We were not supposed to see this...My boyfriend and I spend our weekends in a very rural part of Virginia working on his 15 acre undeveloped property he bought last year.  At 3am I stepped outside for a cigarette and walked towards the end of the driveway.  I was drawn because I noticed that there were an unusual number and arrangement of stars in the sky.  There were too many of them to begin with, they were bright and they FILLED the northern sky.  As I stood there I saw that many were not stationary.  In college I took physics of the universe and realize that stars can have a slight wobble; however, these objects were clearly moving closer…  I stood there transfixed until finally I went to get my boyfriend.  He was not too thrilled to be urged out into the freezing cold at 3am, but obliged.We stood at the end of the driveway and tried to take a video, but because there is not a street light nor neighbor within close proximity we were only able to capture our commentary.  The  objects were spinning, moving erratically, stopping and darting and changing colors.   We noticed one extremely low in altitude to our left.  We hopped in the car and dialed 911 as the sight we felt should be seen by someone in law enforcement, if only to give more credit to what we were seeing.  The operator sounded completely annoyed as I tried to convey the magnitude of what we were witnessing.  When we found a field, we pulled over and parked.  We were encircled by flying objects in the sky.  One with red X's and white lights circling its perimeter flew across the sky at a faster rate than others.  The smaller ones formed spiral/circular patterns overhead.I used a flashlight to 'communicate.' I wasn't sure what I would accomplish, but I didn't feel scared or threatened.  I think it coaxed the objects to come even closer. We had one overhead that had a green light on the underbelly.  There was an SUV that I think must have seen everything as the driver stopped on the road by the field and then sped off.  This is why I listed the witnesses as 3.  What we saw was undeniably the most surreal and bewildering experiences I have ever had.We drove to a 24 hour gas station and then onto another field where we witnessed more of the same and a larger, triangular shaped object with white lights on the corner which tilted and flashed in the middle where two smaller objects circled each other.

2534,"Extreme altitude object moving at high speed North.  Possible near Earth pass by a large asteroid.Event Date: 01/17/2016 Event Time: approximately 14:56 Central Time (GMT – 6:00) Location Coordinates: 32°37'55.0""N 95°27'34.0""W Location Name: Mineola Nature Preserve, Wood County, Texas Weather Conditions: 52° Fahrenheit, clear with scattered thin high altitude clouds, a light breeze, and with wind gusts up to 13mph.Object description:  The object appeared to be oblong in overall shape but irregular similar to a potato.  It appeared to be silver blue very much like the moon seen during the daytime.  Its apparent size was slightly smaller than your thumbnail viewed at arm's length.  It appeared to be blurry or hazy like an object viewed through the atmosphere at great distance.  This is in contrast with the commercial jets seen at the time that were in sharp detail and white in color.  This object made no detectable noise, made no condensation trail, did not appear to be burning in any way, and was very obviously at an extreme altitude.While visiting the Mineola Nature Preserve out on foot, me and one other family member we were watching the local aircraft.  There was a small Cessna aircraft and a biplane flying at low altitudes, intermittently performing aerial acrobatics.  This location is approximately 100 miles East of the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area and other commercial aircraft were traveling from West to East leaving the major airport hubs of the DFW area at midrange altitudes as they climbed towards but have not reached cruising altitudes.  As we could easily hear the engine noise from the commercial aircraft, we would look up at them pass nearly directly overhead which is when we spotted the unknown object.  At approximately 14:56, as a commercial aircraft passed almost directly overhead traveling East South East we spotted this object traveling North.  As we watched the object it progressed from almost directly overhead to the north.  It became difficult to see as it reached an inclination of about 35° above the horizon.The time it took to travel from approximately 90° above the horizon to 35° was between 15 seconds and 20 seconds.  Immediately after loosing track of the object I checked the International Space Station (ISS) tracking website (http://www.isstracker.com/) to rule out the object as being the ISS.  The website showed the then current position of the ISS as being over the Northern section of the Red Sea Moving North East. Conclusion:  After waiting a few days to see if this object was reported by any news agency I decided to see if I could calculate the objects speed.Knowing that I can not accurately determine speed without knowing its altitude, I calculated this objects speed using two potential altitudes.  These two altitudes were 35,000ft for a possible commercial or military aircraft and 200 miles for something passing at an orbital range.  With the 35,000ft altitude, I came up with a minimum speed of 1,700mph up to 2,500mph.  With the 200 mile altitude, I came up with a minimum speed of 51,300mph and a maximum of about 68,000mph.  Given that there was no sonic boom and that the object was hazy and indistinct in a perfectly clear sky I believe that this object was outside of the atmosphere and passed very close to the Earth.  The downside to this belief is that any object that could be seen during the day at that distance with that apparent size would have to be very very large.",Duration:20 seconds,"Location: Mineola, TX",Occurred : 1/17/2016 14:56  (Entered as : 01/17/16 14:56),Posted: 2/4/2016,Reported: 1/31/2016 11:33:17 AM 11:33,Shape: Other

As I observed the area, I saw a light, purple or indigo color, that was fading in and out through the clouds.

We stopped by the Brooklyn Queens Expressway at 65th Street near a park where where our view was unobstructed and at that point we saw a airplane fly under it.  It was a mesmerizing sight to see the plane fly under the object, but have none of the blue rays reflect on it, which led me to believe the object was very far away.  Another exceptional observation was to consider the scale of the shape compared to plane.

2544,"Slim object with band of flickering lights seen hovering above nearby mountain peak - making unbelievable erratic maneuvers.A bit of info on my background: I am disabled with RA and heart problems so I spend a lot of time here at home.  I was a chef and restaurant manager, but I've also worked as a journalist and photographer (which is what I studied in college).  I mention that because I do consider myself a good observer and I've been trained to notice details... for descriptive purposes and setting up photographs.I'm an amateur sky-watcher and often spend nights outside with my Son during meteor showers or other celestial events.  I've seen plenty of aircraft, satellites and often the International Space Station.Many times we have observed strange lights or craft, but in every single instance we have come up with a rational explanation.  For example I'll mark the time and direction of travel and with a bit of research on the internet or with an app on the iPhone it's not too hard to name a satellite or natural object that fits perfectly with what we have seen.  I'm open minded about UFOs, but I'm always going to look for the most logical explanation... a way to identify that object first.  To me the truth is what is most interesting.Well, tonight I'm at a loss. I was sitting on my couch in my office watching a football game when a flickering light in my window kept getting my attention.  I'm naturally curious about everything in the sky and I thought it was a helicopter which I don't see often at night.  So I turned off my TV and decided to watch it.I live many miles away from a small town so there is no light pollution. I don't have any immediate neighbors or streetlights.  The area is wooded and extremely hilly, nestled nicely in the western NC mountains.  The lights from the craft were to the northwest of me over some nearby peaks.  There are trees between me and the mountains, but the lack of leaves in the winter allowed me to keep a visual continuously.It took me less than a minute of observation to realize this was not an airplane or a helicopter. At the distance of my viewing I never got to see the solid body of the craft, but the outline of the of the lights led me to believe that it was a cigar type shape.  There were four or five lights in a horizontal line that constantly flashed on and off in linear sequence.  The timing of the sequence was fast... less than a second... and then it repeated throughout the entire sighting.  All I could think of that it reminded me of was the flashers on some police cars... but stretched out.If the craft I saw simply displayed these strange lights and moved off in a steady manner like a conventional aircraft I would have just shrugged my shoulders and went back to the football game.  But, the way this thing moved got me clamoring for my overcoat and smartphone.  Standing on my back porch gave me a much better view and I could not (and still don't) believe what I was watching!  I found a nice gap in the trees and stood there amazed as this thing with strobe lights moved around in the night sky like something was wrong with it.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING should be able to maneuver like this object was. It was jumping/skipping from spot to spot; not great distances, but up, then over, then back where it started.  The movement was erratic with no pattern that I could discern.  It almost looked like I was seeing some sort of video game glitch.I watched this same action for, I'm guessing, about four minutes.  There was no sound, but that really doesn't mean much because I see many aircraft in these mountains and often there is no sound or very little, it just gets swallowed up.  I mention that because there were planes in the sky at the same time.  I had been seeing another aircraft to my left (farther to the west) and didn't pay it much attention at first.All of a sudden the second craft moved rapidly in a straight line toward the first, pausing for about twenty seconds when the two were extremely close as if investigating - but, that is just conjecture on my part.  This new craft then moved around the strange flashing object (I could not tell if it went in front of or behind it) and flew off out of sight into the mountains to the north at a high rate of speed.This second craft very likely could have been a helicopter as it moved like one... but I have no way of knowing for sure. I do know that the interaction of the two objects was very unconventional.  Manned aircraft don't get that close to each other on purpose, especially at night.I tried taking a video with my iPhone but, I'm pretty sure I got nothing... too dark, and too far away.  I did grab my camera and got in my Jeep and tried to ride to a better vantage point to get a picture.  I saw an aircraft that could have been the possible helicopter involved, but I never could find the strange object again.If anyone has an explanation I'd love to hear it.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Mill Spring, NC",Occurred : 1/16/2016 19:35  (Entered as : 01/16/16 19:35),Posted: 1/20/2016,Reported: 1/16/2016 6:27:01 PM 18:27,Shape: Cigar

When I first saw it I knew it couldn’t be a plane or a shooting star, it was too big and too bright to be either of those.  I pointed it out to my friend with a little alarming tone, and he shook it off as a plane.I tried to explain to him that it just couldn’t be a plane and he began to believe me after the object moved about 6,000 feet and vanished.  Now we we’re both at an alarming state.  We stared at the sky after that non stop and in a few minutes.  It re-appeared in its original location and did the exact same thing.  Moved a bit more this time and soon vanished again.  Now we knew we weren’t imagining stuff.  1 minute later, I spotted a huge bright white circle at about 2,000 feet altitude zooming past at immense speed. It immediately grabbed my attention and I showed my friend.  We watched it fly across the sky until it dropped past the horizon.  This thing was giant!  It’s not possible this was a balloon or any other man made substance...it just doesn't make sense.  Meteors aren't that big and neither are comets.  And I'm sure at that low altitude it would be on fire.  But not a perfect circle.  We have no explanation for either of these strange incidents but one more thing happened, soon before the white circle went out of sight a white firework light up at the opposite side of the circle without any sound which was kind of coincidental but I’m not sure that was anything of significance.  I know the circle didn't make the firework because it wasn't in the same location.  It just wouldn't have made sense.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Austin, TX",Occurred : 1/15/2016 20:30  (Entered as : 01/15/16 20:30),Posted: 1/20/2016,Reported: 1/15/2016 7:49:53 PM 19:49,Shape: Circle

2559,"Red/orange light moving very slowly above treeline, with no sound.Liverpool, New York 13090 Friday January 15, 2016 Approximately 7:15 pm Traveling by car on Longbranch Road north towards Rt. 57 First sighted a bright, round red/orange light moving slowly above the tree tops from the right hand side of the road.  After a few seconds observed it was very unusual and pulled over to the right shoulder of the road.  Exited vehicle and walked 15 to 20 steps forward, towards the object.  Watched it as it passed over the road ahead of me, and then slowly passed over Longbranch Elementary School (ahead on the left side of road).  Object moved towards the North West in a straight line, at uniform elevation, until it faded from view.  There was no sound from the object.  As it got closer there seemed to be a corona effect around the center of the light.  The light seemed to vary within the confines of the corona (slight flickering).  At two points (first before it crossed Longbranch Road, and before I exited the car) it seemed there was something dripping from beneath the object, and the dripping material was brightly illuminated, like a small flame.  Observed that again while standi! ng on shoulder of road outside the car, just after it crossed above the road.  There was a light wind coming from the East (checked the National Weather Service afterwards).The object was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a flare, not a chinese lantern.  Had it been a flare, I would have seen the parachute, it would have descended in altitude, and the quality of the light would have been completely different (I’ve seen flares before and know what they look like).  I do not know what the light object was, and have never seen anything remotely like it before.I drove further up Longbranch Road, looking to the left side trying to see the object. The view was obstructed by buildings and trees.  Arriving at my destination, Rite Aid store on corner of Rt. 57 and Longbranch Rd, I looked back in the direction of original sighting and saw the light in the distance, perhaps a mile away.  It was much fainter at that distance.  It moved approximately to the west, then doubled back 180 degrees opposite direction for about one second, then reversed to opposite direction again continuing beyond the point in the sky where it first changed direction. I went a little further and blinked out of sight.  Then it blinked back in sight, but further to the west.  It continued on that trajectory until it faded from view.  I did not see it on the return trip back home.I do not drink. I don't take recreational drugs.

I knew instantly that this wasn’t a plane or jet.  No blinking lights, no sound whatsoever.  It was not a meteor because it never burnt up.  The object had no trail but yet it was burning.  Object was not a candle balloon lantern, as it was much larger and higher in the sky, traveling fast.  Also it was not the ISS either, as I am a regular observer of the space station and this object was clearly not in orbit.

2577,"Unexplained Sighting Over BRADENTON, FL *January 14th, 2016  7:20 a.m *I was driving from Clearwater to Cape Coral for business, early on the morning of January 14th, 2016, and headed southbound on Interstate 75.  It was a particularly clear sky that morning, I recall, as I had been on the road before the sun had even begun to rise.   About 10 minutes after getting over the Sunshine Skyway, I kept thinking I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, to the SW of my present position.  Because the Tampa airport is so close, MacDill AFB, and many private air fields, I normally wouldn't think twice about anything in the sky; but it seemed unusual.  The road took a slight bend, and the treeline disappeared, allowing for a much more clear view towards where I was noticing something.  I then saw what I would have to assume was 2 lights?  It was too far from me to decipher much, and I was going 70 mph, but it seemed stationary.  Considering that perhaps my rate of travel was off-setting the stationary appearance of the object, I moved into the right lane so I could slow down to see it more clearly.  The object moved in a pattern that formed a small vertical circle, but did so very quickly.  Judging by the distance, it was atypical for anything I have seen to date.  It did this several more times, while intermittently flashing light(s) so bright, it seemed difficult to tell if it was so bright that it appeared blue, or was alternating more than one light with various hues.  It then moved about 25 degrees to the south in what seemed like the blink of an eye, before vanishing so fast that it left a silver hazy streak behind.  The streak disappeared within a second or so, but as a first time observer of an object such as this, all I could do was close my mouth.  I have never experienced anything remotely close to this, nor have I been aware of any manned/unmanned craft capable of such precise movement, at such a high rate of speed.

The object caught my attention since it was the only object in the sky; at first I thought this was only a cloud, however there wasn’t any other clouds in the sky.  I took a couple photos and then sat back down on the couch continuing watching TV but still keeping an eye out the window when all of a sudden 5 or 10 minutes later the image moved a bit and had looked like it broke up showing other objects hovering below and to the sides of the larger object; that’s when I confirmed to myself its only a cloud since it had broke up a bit..  But then what happened next is when I realized it’s a UFO.., the object came together as one again and started to leave; it moved east away from where I was.After the UFO left I noticed the morning sky filled with more then a dozen fighter jets.About 1 hour later around 0730 the object repapered; the UFO was cloaked and appeared as a large cloud; next there were 2 fighter jets which flew over our house and headed east toward the UFO.. as the jets approached, the UFO started to leave and head east away from the incoming jets pursuing it; in the distance I noticed what looked like the first jet to plummet down (as if the jet was shoot down or it pursued a drone or something).  The scale of how large the UFO was enormous, in the pictures you can tell that the size of the jets in comparison were tiny, this UFO dwarfed our jets, this was their mother ship as it's referred to or a floating city.One hour later the object reappeared and headed west toward our house and then north and dropped down behind the mountain ridge.  In the distance you could see jets flying all around in that direction.  Further I saw another plan flying overhead, this was a radar plan, the plan with the large circle dome on the top of it.There was a lot of activity over the Los Angeles National forest this morning; I called the news station and the LA National Ranger Station, but no one followed back up with me.((NUFORC Note:  The object in the photo seems to us to be a cloud.

Heading south on the freeway I saw two adjacent lights flying west directly ahead in my line of sight while driving.  The lights did not blink and seemed to be part of the same craft though no actual body of the craft was visible only two round lights travelling together at the same speed no sound.  Within a matter of seconds the lights dimmed out of sight and for the remainder of my 15-minute drive along the freeway where I have a open view of the sky, the lights did not reappear.Approximately two years ago I had an encounter with a UFO while driving with two friends maybe around 8:00pm.  Two adjacent lights dim yellow-orange, hovering somewhat close to the ground in an area with absolutely no tall buildings.  They were solid in color and did not blink such as a plane does. As we turned the car back to get a better look they had vanished.Further Description:   	Lights seemed to be about the height of a helicopter •	Traveled short distance before disappearing •	Traveled in straight line •	Faster than a helicopter •	Yellow orange, resembled the brightness of a plane in the distance •	DID NOT BLINK AT ALL!! Which I assume violates FAA regulations •	Several blinking aircraft in the vicinity •	Space between lights must have been massive, larger than a blimp  As the lights dimmed out of sight I would compare it to a falling star as it dies smoothly fading out of sight.The lights must have been attached to the same craft that was not visible or hidden by the night.The space between the lights could’ve held a blimp between them but traveled too fast.Distance from UFO was not clear since no actual body was visible. Either way the space between the lights is unexplainable, much too large for any aircraft of my knowledge.

This area is well known for planes as it has an airport just north of this location as well as an air force base.  Seeing planes of all shapes and sizes come and go is not abnormal and that is why this stood out so much.  As i drove south on Powers I saw what at first appeared to be a plane.  Three bright white lights in a diamond shape and one flashing red on what i would describe as the body of the craft.  The craft heading south banks and starts to head north towards the airport.  Now this is not too unusual for military craft and the slow speed it seemed to be moving at suggested military aircraft.  As I made my way to Fontaine I made a right and headed west on Fontaine.  The craft could be seen out my drivers side window.  As the craft grew closer it seemed to slow down to a point that any normal aircraft would fall out of the sky.  This one however hovered above homes in the area.  There was no sound from the craft and it was not a helicopter based on size and light position on the craft.  Also, there was no reflection from either the white or flashing red light on the craft.  I made a left heading south down Mesa Ridge Pkwy and the craft was completely motionless.  As i passed it on the left i watched it in my rear view mirror.  It moved West behind me.  I turned my car around to follow this strange aircraft.

My father noted that any plane moving that slowly would have fallen from the sky.  The light dimmed as the ""star"" turned South and began moving faster toward our house.  My mother and I quickly went outside to see if we could see the actual craft instead of just the light.  It changed course slightly, instead taking it higher and further to the side behind some trees rather than directly overhead.We never heard the sound of a plane engine or rotor of a helicopter.As we were watching the ""star"" through the trees now heading Southeast, another object flew Northeast overhead very low but much quicker.  It looked like the lights of a helicopter, but again, absolutely no sound.We are very accustomed to hospital helicopters flying overhead between Rocky Mount, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and Greenville at all hours.

2616,"Unbelievable lights over Georgia.It started with me and my wife walking onto our back porch for a cig. right after it got dark. She actually had to point it out to me but when she did I noticed a bright orange/red ball of light fade into brightness, hold for a second to three seconds then dim out, only to reappear in the same spot and then suddenly split into two which faded out almost immediately.Normally we both try to throw off easy possible explanations, seeing as I have been into space and astronomy my whole life, but could not find any logical explanation other than maybe it was a missile from a military aircraft.After my wife walked inside to get out of the cold, no more than 5 minutes later I witnessed the same light. I did not call out to my wife because, as before, the light faded after the same appearance, but quickly after is disappeared it came back and went out a few times. Which is when I yelled for my wife to come out, even got a neighbor curious. She came to see the very end of this appearance which was the light flaring up again only this time it split into 2 evenly sized lights which immediately faded and did not return .As if that was not enough I was so amped up I told her I was going out front to get a better view and watch longer to try to see if I could spot patterns or anything.  Once I got out front it took a good 20-30 minutes before my next strange sighting.  This time it was a bunch of individual blinking lights.  No pattern whatsoever to how they blinked which is usually what I look for to debunk it as a known aircraft, but as I watched I noticed the blinking lights, which were much smaller and whiter than the previous one, had started to make 180 degree immediate turns.  As if they bounced off a wall and started going the opposite direction with no certain heading. For example on would go straight, immediately turn around , then suddenly head straight up or down. It was not just one it was all of them.  It literally looked as if lights were popping all around all at once  , and then as if related, the bright ball of orange/red light appeared just off to the left center of the group ! or blinking starts. only this time it flared and died out and did not return at all.  Soon after the blinking lights disappeared.  They did not leave, let me be clear of that.  They disappeared. Meaning I was watching them all blinking, and one by one , sometimes two at a time, would just vanish, and stop blinking.  I tried to think maybe cloud cover was causing the sudden loss of the lights but I pinpointed background stars in the same general area to which the lights were and could still see the stars.Finally after my mother arrived she was getting groceries out of her truck and I was still outside maybe 10 minutes after my last sighting.  I suddenly yelled at her to look, because she is a big anti ufo person, and as she did she pointed out that it had went out and moved to the right.  I heard her then get into her truck to get more stuff while I was still staring and the light was still there it amazingly suddenly had another exactly same light appear next to it and unbelievably came together into one and vanish just like the first sighting but backwards. After which I did not see that light anymore.No more than 30 min later I witnessed several more small blinking lights behaving really strange, like disappearing and reappearing going the opposite way, or suddenly appearing and then as if it was never there it is gone.I know how silly this sounds but I have been a firm believer of science and facts my whole life.  For 20 years of my life I have lived at this house and looked up at the same sky countless nights without seeing something even relatively as strange.  I know how aircraft lights behave and satellites.  They have patterns.  The closest pattern any of these lights had was only once when me and my wife saw the cluster of lights blink shortly almost in sync.  I really would like to know if maybe it was just some strange military testing or flying that was going on, or possibly military flares, but the way it happened, I can't, for the life of me, begin to understand what I saw.

2646,"Cylinder or Cigar Shaped Object (Vertical) with 3 Orange LightsI am reporting this sighting for my girlfriend, my teenage son and his teenage girlfriend.  Unfortunately I was out of town on business at the time.As my 16 year old son left to drive his girlfriend home, he noticed strange lights in one of our fields/pastures on our property.  He thought at first that some lights may have been left on down near the hunting lodge about 200 yards from the main house.  Upon returning, he summoned my girlfriend to walk outside and look.  They determined it was in the field and nowhere near the lodge and in fact all power to the lodge was off.  They both described it as capsule shaped but vertical not horizontal.  It was three separate orange lights stacked on top of each other forming the capsule/cylinder.What is important to note here is this:  There is no access to that field other than our driveway/road which is 3/4 of mile long and blocked with a security gate.  The field is surrounded by thick (really thick woods) and a large creek surrounds the field in a horseshoe fashion.  Again... the only way in and out is to drive directly by our home.They watched it for 5 minutes and called me.  I tried to convince them to take a shotgun and drive out in my 4x4.  They refused.  This actually angered me because I was thinking there may be trespassers on the property but they said they could hear nothing and there was no movement.  They literally locked themselves in the house for the night and had trouble sleeping.  Upon returning home, I asked them separately to draw the object.  They did, and they both had the same exact description.  My son's girlfriend described the same thing, as she saw it 20 minutes prior.  They never stayed outside to watch it until it did whatever it did to go out or ""leave"".  This is due to the fact that in order to see it, they had to walk about 50 yards from the house in the dark in order to see it.Personally I'm upset that they did check it out.

2654,"We saw a giant silent floating disc hovering above Deep Cove's marina inlet in North Vancouver, shining very bright lights around.Deep Cove UFO sighting: Jan 6, 2016.Personal background I am an adult, part time artist, living in Deep Cove, North Vancouver.  I have lived in the area of Deep Cove, in North Vancouver, B.C. for most of my life, around 25 + years.  To give a brief description of my personal background I believe in peace on Earth, and aim to contribute my energies there.  Lately, more than before in previous years I have been seeing objects floating in the night sky that are hard to identify or even explain.  Many of these experiences have been UFO sightings.Description of the UFO sighting I witnessed with my father on the night of Thursday, Jan 6th, 2016, at approx. 9:30 pm.:   At approx. 9:30pm, as my father and I were sitting at the benches on the hillside next to the proximity of the kayaking facility/rental business, just south, facing north of Panorama Park, in downtown Deep Cove, we both witnessed a massive unidentified floating object, or disc, hovering at the height of approx. 100 - 200 meters above sea level; floating absolutely silently over the Marina, initially appearing from behind Seymour Mountain.  It had at first appeared at the top of the mountain peak, near beside a popular look out - Quarry Rock.This object was round or disc shaped, appearing dark in color. When it first appear, however, it was just a singular light.  Then it proceeded to leave the area coming over the Marina, directly hovering over the ocean (cove inlet).  It stayed there for at least a minute, shining its lights (which was initially just one singular, then became three lights, then became multiple).As the object descended from the mountain over the ocean, it expanded and became a massive round shaped disc, approx. 10 or more times the size in diameter - to that of the moon the in sky- multiplying its array of displayed visible lights, to approx. over one dozen bright lights.  The lights at first were the same size and large, and as the object expanded over the ocean and became a larger disc shape, the lights became different shapes and sizes (large-round & small-square), and were arranged in symmetry around the object’s outer edge.  Pattern of the lights around the edge: was one large-round light, then three to four little ones, then one large one, etc.At this point the UFO then proceeded to shine these lights out in all directions.  The light itself was very bright and powerful, but not seemingly blinding.  It was a contained light, and not ‘radiating’ outward, but ‘concentrated’, spotting certain areas.My father and I were both facing north at the time of the sighting, and were both standing at approx. 30 feet above sea level.  There was a thick fog in the sky.  Although I have a hard time recalling if it was in fact clear out, or if there was stars visible.  The photo we snapped appears to have many star like lights in the image.Finished this report at 1:20 am Jan 7th, 2016.",Duration:15,"Location: North Vancouver, BC",Occurred : 1/6/2016 21:30  (Entered as : Jan 6 9:30),Posted: 1/8/2016,Reported: 1/7/2016 1:51:58 AM 01:51,Shape: Disk
2655,"Giant mother ship sighted in Indian Arm-Mount Seymour side, from Deep Cove.Deep Cove sighting Report   As we sat to eat some pizza at a park table and bench near the canoe rental at Deep Cove, looking North,  I noticed a small light that caught my attention, as it was moving quite rapidly in many directions at the North West end of the Inlet.To put it in perspective, the mountains at the end of the Indian arm inlet are about 1500 meters in height and they are the North Eastern Horizon, when looking from Deep Cove’s Gallant Avenue.The sighting occurred in the South East face of Seymour Mountain while we were looking from the South side of the canoe rental outlet at the first of two park’s covered table.It was night time and the fog line was about four to five hundred meters above the water at the mountain face.Directly in front of us was Deep Cove Yate Club and to the right of our vision range, would be mid sight a place called Cory Rock, past the Marina, the sighting was to the North East of Cory Rock.A small light was moving around almost at the fog line at the mountain side definitively at the forest located at the North West end of the Indian Arm Inlet, past Cory Rock, past the Woodlands community and above it.The small light, caught my attention and I asked my daughter if she had seen it.  She replied yes, it may be someone with a flash light in the woods in the woods.  It did not make sense to me, as the trees are all over 100 feet tall in that forest, and whoever was passing around the light, should have been way taller than the tree line.Suddenly, the small light transformed into a huge search light like beam of intense white light (halogen type).The diameter of the light was larger than anti aerial search lights.  Suddenly, it was overlapped by a light of the same diameter and size (easily the diameter of a two levels house) given the distance, the aerial phenomena suddenly expanded to a series of round lights with three to four square or semi rectangular windows of light in between also observed by my daughter however omitted in her report.Then it came the most spectacular encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence ever; a large beam of light came from the center of the apparat or flying disk that illuminated the fog and created a daylight effect at the mountain, which allowed the true three dimensional perspective of size to be seeing.It had at that point no less than three and up to four of the round  search lights with the large semi rectangular windows of light in between, it had come from behind Mount Seymour, to hover silently above the inlet, when suddenly started a display of lights equal only to the PNE show of lights.  However, these beams were more potent.Given the distance and the fact that the object covered a great portion of the Mountain and horizon.  A conservative estimate of height or thickness of the saucer like object, could be 100 meters and its full diameter 7 to 10 full moons which could equate given the distance to a quarter to one third of a mile or 400 to 600 meters in diameter.  Minimum, hovering over 100 Meter above the water.The object in the same manner that materialized itself, dematerialized or placed all multiple potent search beams and lights going in all directions, off.Leaving a dome with what I perceived to be some windows, as the sole visible lights.I managed to take two pictures.  Picture 1. Is a total blank image white color in my black berry (never had that happen) the second one amazingly enough, shows an angle that was not the one I was focusing but the picture shows more of the village, or no less than 30-45 degrees left of where my camera was actually pointing at the smaller light.Afraid of the whole situation given the sheer size of the spaceship and lights show, we fast walked, almost run to Deep Cove to talk to someone.  Our friend was busy, so we went back to the ocean lookout at the end of Gallant Avenue.There was no light yet, it suddenly returned not for long or in full splendor but it did, hovered there for a while and disappeared in the fog at the end of the inlet sky.I could only equate it to a spaceship the size of Independence day.Having had multiple experiences with these machines, I declare the one we saw, was something that if it was seen in any city of the Planet, general world panic would ensue.When I sought I had seen many large UFO in Deep Cove with my daughter last year, this one, was a close up, mother ship and a half.Sorry for my grammar and composition, I am a miner, not a writer.",Duration:1-2 minutes,"Location: North Vancouver (Canada), BC",Occurred : 1/6/2016 21:30  (Entered as : 01/06/16 21:30),Posted: 1/14/2016,Reported: 1/9/2016 1:42:38 AM 01:42,Shape: Disk

Scottsdale, AZ, higher than the rest of the valley 7:30-8:30pm  I stepped outside to see three large bright lights in the sky in a triangle formation.  I was driving but every time I looked they had rotated while staying in a triangle.  If you had a full moon and put a point on the top and sides of a full moon, I would say this is how far they were from one another.  By the time I pulled over there was only one light left; I told my boyfriend I wasn’t going anywhere until this light disappeared.  It was not above me in the sky, but south of me low on the horizon.Another bright light reappeared nearby the other.  One left its location and slowly crossed the sky.  It decreased in brightness and traveled east to west.  If you split the sky in 18 sections, it would cross one of these in a little less than a minute.  Planes flew by but were fast and not nearly as bright as even the traveling UFO.  The light they emitted was pure white.  When they traveled they usually got dimmer.  I took off my glasses and the only light I could see in the sky, including stars, were these lights.We starred at them freaking out with excitement for an hour.  They would occasionally disappear and reappear in a nearby location.  My boyfriend and I argued of what he thought was a plane at about 8 o’clock.  It had two very dim white lights flashing very close in proximity and moved faster than the UFO’s before.  I convinced him that it was a UFO because the lights were not consistent in spacing.  They also would fly back and forth from east to west.Also I do not know if it was just me because I was wearing glasses, but they individually appeared to be elongated vertically.  The light looked like it came to a small point and expanded to the rest of the light. It was very subtle, but he said he could kind of see it too.We ended up leaving before they were gone.

2677,"While driving on 95S, i saw a triangle with an inverted bottom, outlined in chasing white lights hovering/bobbing above Santa Fe casinoI live in the Centennial Hills area of Las Vegas, NV.  This is the northwest. I was traveling to work southbound on the 95 freeway.  I was late for work.  I always watch the skies.  I don’t know why, it's not like I ever see anything.  On 1/5/2016 between the hours of 9:25pm and 9:45pm, I actually did.  As I passed the Santa Fe Casino, on my left, right above the casino I witnessed a triangular V-shaped object over the casino.  I cannot remember if it was over the parking garage area or closer to the casino part.  I am not sure.  What I am sure of, however, is that I was seeing a V-shaped aerial object.    The object that I saw was ""hovering"" in the air, as low as a helicopter could fly.  (I have had airplanes fly by or helicopters sit idle near me and I hear a sound)  This object was  emitting absolutely NO sound. It was close enough for me to hear a sound.  I would have heard a sound.  Were this a helicopter or an airplane, I'm sure I would have heard sound.  I thought maybe it was some type of military stealth flying object.  But why would it be just hovering Non-stealthily over the nasty old Santa Fe Casino?  Also I saw lights.  I cannot say for sure what other colors I saw besides white.  White was the dominant color, I do know that for sure.  There could have been other colors as well.  What I can say for absolute assurity is that the lights were chasing.  Chasing like those Christmas lights that people have.  The lights were chasing in the shape of the object that I was seeing, which was a V shape (acute triangle) two long sides with a shorter bottom.  The bottom was invert! ed to another v.      As I was seeing this, my psyche attempted to explain away my optical.  The reason I was unsuccessful at explaining this away, was because of the motion of the object.  As it hovered in that spot, it rotated at a half circle as it bobbed up and down slightly, while slightly tilted to the right.  The movement of the craft, the location of the craft and the fact that I could hear no sound from a craft that was in such close proximity to my vehicle are the reasons why I am writing this report.  The behavior of the craft frightened me more than the sight of it.  I felt an immediate fear mixed with excitement mixed with dread mixed with sadness.  A combination of feelings that I have never felt.    Please be advised that I was driving when I witnessed this.  I pulled to the carpool lane and started to drive very slowly to ensure that I was seeing what I was seeing.  I started to swerve cause I was looking at the object instead of looking at the road.  I turned away to keep from getting pulled over for a traffic violation.  I was afraid to stop and pull over.This happened to me.  I do not have any history of mental illness.  I have never made a report of something like this before.  I believe in the existence of something other than human beings for several reasons that I will not go into, because that is not what this report is for.  I just want whoever this gets to, to  take my accounts seriously.  I am a previous member of law enforcement.  I have had to listen to reports like this frequently from crazy people.  I know the difference.  I hope you do too.  I know what I saw.  I just would like someone to tell me why I saw it.",Duration:i don't know,"Location: Las Vegas, NV",Occurred : 1/5/2016 21:35  (Entered as : 01/05/2016 21:35),Posted: 1/14/2016,Reported: 1/9/2016 4:51:10 AM 04:51,Shape: Triangle

2679,"I was sitting on my front porch, when I witnessed two objects flying from south to north at an apparent high rate of speed, at about 50-55 degrees in the western sky.  There was absolutely no sound and they appeared as perhaps the brightness of an average star with a fuzzy-red quality to them.  Earth-bound aircraft must have strobe lights.  These had none.  One sped into view going in a straight line and, within one second, another followed even faster, catching up to the first one.  They then diverged from one another, making several immediate and instantaneous sharp angle turns.  This is something our aircraft cannot even come close to achieving.  It was as if they were doing aerial maneuvers in a somewhat playful way.  At one point it appeared like they might run into each other.  I cannot tell how fast they were moving because I do not know how far away they were.  One is a function of the other.  My best educated guess would be they were one mile away which would put their speed at something like 600 mph.  I base this on seeing airplanes flying at a given pace at 30,000 feet knowing they are moving at 500-600 mph.  However, they could have been 20 miles away putting their speed 20 times faster, or 12000 mph. Both scenarios are equally plausible.  The whole viewing lasted maybe 5-10 seconds and it was frustrating that I couldn't see it over and over again in a rewind/play/rewind fashion.  It leaves more questions than answers....Could these have been drones?

2715,"At exactly 6:15am, Sunday morning, the third of January,2016, I woke up and looked out of my bedroom window which is at the head of my bed.  I initially intended to check the outside temp on a thermometer attatched to my window screen.  It was 22° and very clear.  My attention was quickly diverted to the skyline above Greencastle pike.  Just above the tree line behind my house I noticed a very low flying object which basically looked liked a very bright ball of white light.  I couldn't make out any shape of the craft as the light was too bright.  It continued to fly very slowly in a southern direction towards Hagerstown's west end.  I just assumed it was a Cessna type plane flying low on a landing approach to the Hagerstown airport and I continued admiring the clear morning sky.As I'm scanning the sky and looking at what stars, I could see, I noticed two other passenger planes flying at different directions at a much higher altitude than the flying ball of bright light I first noticed.  Both of those planes displayed the blinking red lights that I'm familiar seeing.The sight of those higher flying planes made me realize that the plane that I thought was a Cessna wasn't displaying any red or blinking lights at all, just one massive light covering the entire craft.  I also realized that the ball of white light was actually flying towards the center of town, not to the airport as I originally thought because of it's low altitude and speed.  It was literally just ten or fifteen feet above the tree line that runs perpendicular to Greencastle pike and connects to the adjacent neighbourhood.When I gathered all my thoughts together and began to think that this thing may not be a private plane at all, I grabbed for my phone which was charging on the nightstand next to my bed with the intention to shoot some video.  As I raised the phone and fumbled with video mode and focus, the light disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  I didn't see a light trail that I would expect to see if the object had accelerated away at high speed, nor could I see a dark outline of an unlit object against the morning sky.  It's as if it were erassed with no trace of it ever being there in the first place.At this point I just froze in place. I didn't know how to feel or what to think. I was just numb trying to understand what in the world it was that I just witnessed.  Never in my 48 years have I seen anything in the sky that I couldn't explain.For the past few days in my spare time I've been driving around the area directly under where I observed the light trying to explain this off as something normal.  There are no high mountain roads for it to have been car headlights, and I believe the object behind the light was too big to be a civilian (toy) drone.This object was in my view for exactly 5 minutes.  It made no sound at all, never changed speed or color, and never diverted from its flight path before I lost sight of it.  As far as size is concerned, I'm guessing that it was equivalent to the size of a private Cessna style plane, but possible a little bigger.  The trees that I observed the object flying over are approximately 50-60 feet high, putting the height of the object in flight at about 75-100 feet.Lastly, I scanned the sky that Sunday morning in all directions until 7:20am, trying to relocate whatever it was that I witnessed.  I've also checked the same area of sky from 5:30am until 7am the following Monday and Tuesday mornings only to find nothing out of the ordinary.",Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Hagerstown, MD",Occurred : 1/3/2016 06:30  (Entered as : 01/03/16 6:30),Posted: 1/8/2016,Reported: 1/7/2016 12:41:08 AM 00:41,Shape: Unknown

2737,"Mothership UFO in Tempe probed by airforce helicopters and jets.  Very strange sighting, and my only sighting.If people are interested, I will go into more detail, but for now I will keep it short and sweet. Was up early for one of my 2 required Saturday shifts for work.  Happened to go sit on my balcony to stargaze and relax, before heading in to work in a few hours.  Saw what initially resembled the usual airplanes that come through to go to the Phoenix Airport nearby, however, this object quickly approached and I could tell it was much too large to be an airplane.  It started out roughly saucer like with your typical yellowish white light, but then literally started to morph green, blue, red, orange, etc in a fashion such as fiber optics would look like. Still not that shocked, I continued to watch it approach from the north and it eventually completely stopped and just hovered, only making a few impossible maneuvers for any (declassified) man-made tech.  To make things really interesting, as it hovered, it twice descended while dropping what seemed to be small disc like crafts with the similar cycling of lights the ""mothership"" had.  The only reason I wasn't sure of how many came from it was because I was too focused on all of the helicopters and airforce jets sneaking up to get a closer look.  The object hovered a good 30 minutes before this happened and I never took my eyes off it.  It would morph and change from the saucer like shape to almost a crown or diamond type shape, but the color now stayed mostly yellowish white.  When approached by what I believe to be a helicopter (that or a jet) it appeared to playfully recede at any probe too close to it.  As the sun was beginning to come up, it lowered what looked like a few hundred foot ""ropes"" of light, 3 to be exact.  The smaller craft that were closer to the ground sort of just hovering as well then slowly ascended up and merged back with the ""mothership"", all the while the jets and helicopters were EVERYWHERE.  I mean they weren't making it obvious, but I could hear the helicopters and see the jets.  Finally, the object made some crazy ""skipping"" like maneuvers and as it did so, one of the tiny little clouds that were in the sky came as if it was called over, and the object slowly dimmed and went higher and higher.  It was the most insane thing I have ever seen.  I am a college educated male, 25 years of age, and only drink on the rare occasion.  Wide awake for a good 3 hours of witnessing all of these strange events.  I really would like to see if anyone else witnessed something similar!  I have always been somewhat of a believer, but still do not know if I am witnessing new experimental aircraft, or ET phenomenon.  I am open minded and will not jump to conclusions, but this has me very, very intrigued.  I will continue to watch that area of the sky in the same hours now to see if I can catch any more glimpses of what went on.

Then after only a few seconds of observing them, it appeared that they began to rotate on one axis, then on another but remaining in triangular form and distance from each other.   As they began to rotate in unison, two other large orange lights emerged in my view, following closely behind and in the path of the first three lights.  I could now see five lights.I then ran inside, got my wife out of bed, and she then confirmed she could see what I was seeing.  She witnessed the three lights in triangular formation, and the two lights following closely behind.  I ran back inside, and woke up my visiting parents so they could also observe.  The four of us watched as the three lights in triangular formation separated from formation and slowly rose in altitude in to the clouds illuminated by their light.

Hwy 99, from Sacramento to L.A..Just south of Sacramento, about Elk Grove area.I noticed 6 to 7 light peach colored, illuminated objects in the sky.Moving in a Easterly direction.Having been in the Air Force and seeing many air shows at first I thought they were a formation of military helicopters, they were moving about that speed.Slow and steady.  They did not appear to be that high up (less than a mile. Maybe a half to 3/4).  Being night time it was difficult to tell.  Also, being in a big rig and on a hwy it was not possible to tell by sound (too noisy).  For that same reason I could not tell if it made any noise.The formation was very odd as well.  One I've never seen before.4 points to make a square, then one above to form what would look like the pitch of a house.Then another 3 times the length out from there.  Pointing in the direction it was going.  East, north easterly.I've been a night driver for many many years.  I've never seen anything like this before.My gut feeling was this was not E.T..I did not stop for a better look. So I could not tell if this was one object with lights or several objects (by seeing if there was a star field between them).  They moved in perfect unison.I watched them for about a min before they and I passed beyond my windshield view.The color of the lights were very odd.  Like no color I've ever seen on a flying craft.Not red nor orange. More like a faint peach color. Or a spot light turned down very low (color wise) yet the light was very illuminated.  Having flown and taken lessons planes have two colors.  One on each wing.  Red and blue or blue green.  White lights forward.  Never peach.I thought about a blimp for New Years, that's possible, but I sure could not make out its message?  For what it's worth.  Much further south out around hwy 41 and 46 on both hwy 99 and Interstate 5 we have many night time crop dusters that you can get all kinds of crazy light formations (not different colors) because they fly in very weird positions to prepare for crop dusting in a very short span.

2782,"Eight small circular craft near surface seen at Fairbanks, Alaska.On the evening of December 31, 2015, and into the morning of January 1, 2016, at Fairbanks, Alaska, I witnessed the following:  While driving my vehicle south on the Parks Highway, near the vicinity of the University of Alaska farm fields [Geist Rd and Parks Highway off ramps] I noted five objects rising from the left [west], at near-ground level and move across the highway at an altitude of 300-400 feet.  They appeared under independent control and seemed to be making a 5-sided 'sign' in their arrangement.  I initially assumed they were fireworks on parachutes.The time was just before midnight and fireworks were evident in this built-up area that includes residential and light commercial development.  The area of activity is between the Fairbanks International Airport and the University of Alaska.The objects were both stationary at one moment and then in motion as a unit. I stopped the vehicle, exited to the roadway for a better look.  There was no sound.  The objects appeared to be circular, 15 to 30 inches in diameter.  There were no other discernible details of surfaces.  Each appeared to be emanating a red/yellow glow or pulse that remained constant.  The 'fire' color conformed closely with the area where it was coming from.  The light appeared to make a small protruding tail to the steady pulse/glow. It was brighter at the center.Over a period of 20 minutes, I continued to observe the phenomenon.  The objects did not dip, as a helicopter does when it moves forward.  Once climbing, they did not move to a lower level.  The original 5 units slowly climbed into the sky, spread out, moved to the east [toward U. S. Army Fort Wainwright].  The lights appeared to blink out and the craft vanished in the darkness.After stopping, I had doubled back on the highway, and stopped again, where I noticed three new craft, similar to the first five.  They were flying over the roadway in the same fashion to the others.  When near to the ground they were tightly grouped and as they climbed they spread out.  They, too, headed east, climbed higher and disappeared.I am aware that the University of Alaska has a DOD contract for development and testing of advanced drones.  During daylight hours I have observed a drone flight a few miles from this vicinity.  Further, as mentioned, DOD maintains a large post within 6 miles of the sighting location.  Additionally, DOD maintains Eielson AFB, 30 miles south-east of this location.",Duration:20 minutes,"Location: Fairbanks, AK",Occurred : 12/31/2015 23:55  (Entered as : 12/30/15 0:00),Posted: 1/5/2016,Reported: 1/1/2016 6:52:31 PM 18:52,Shape: Circle

At about 11:45pm on New Years Eve, I what appeared to be 2 orange ""orbs"" moving from the SE to NW direction, passing directly over my house as I stood in the driveway.  I watched as the approached from a distance.  At first I thought they were 2 helicopters, but as the got closer I noticed they were flying relatively low (perhaps 700ft?)  and there was no sound or any lights to indicate port and starboard.  The only light emitted was an orange glow.  As they passed over my house, I walked from the driveway to the street and faced the NW to watch them.  They appeared to be ascending but as they did, the light faded to a mere dot and then I could no longer see them.  They were not moving very fast at all….no erratic movements.  Just a moderate, steady pace and what appeared to be a steady climb.  They did not seem to move further away from each other.  I thought perhaps someone was flying drones. I then noticed more approaching….3.  They all flew the! same heading, no erratic movements.  More followed. In 3's, except for the second to last wave.  There were 5 grouped together, then finally 3 more for a total of 21.   The first 2 were from the SE, whereas the remainder seemed to come from a more due-south location, but all ended up passing over my home and headed NW/NNW.  I never heard a sound and after passing over the house…maybe 500ft beyond the house, they seemed to just continue to ascend and lose their glow, fading to no light at all.  But the lights didn't seem to disappear due to climbing in altitude.  They just stopped glowing. I could no longer see them.

It behaved like the star as it moved higher in the sky as the night went on. I lost interest as I thought it must have been just a star.  Tonight I went for a walk with my parents and saw it again.  I pointed it out and they thought it was very strange. My whole family lived hear O'Hare in Chicago for a majority of our lives making us used to aircraft. We got out the binoculars and four of us (me, my parents, my boyfriend) viewed it through the binoculars all seeing the same thing - distinct red, blue, green, white lights - my dad said it reminded him of LEDs because they were so vivid and distinct. I could also see the halo around the object changing color with the object. My parents said they've never seen an! ything like it.

Each object emitted a white flickering light.  As the last of the objects was coming into view, we all ran inside through to the front of the house to see what they were doing on the other side; all the while recording.

2820,"While driving at sunset, I saw a hovering, vertical, cylindrical object glowing in the sun, which then separated into two objects.While driving SE on Orient Drive, SE of Orient, OR, I saw a stationary, vertical object off to my right, which was illuminated by the setting sun.  The object was about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon.  Its height was nearly the same visual size as the visual diameter of the moon (~0.5 degrees).  I continued driving for some distance along Orient Drive watching the object and looking for a place to park.  I turned onto SE 312th and parked near Hwy 26.  I watched the object, which was SW of my position, for several minutes.  The better view that I now had showed the object to have the appearance of a vertical cylinder.  It was drifting extremely slowly to the south and began to separate into two cylinders one above the other, each with the proportions of a soup can.  The upper cylinder began leading the lower as they moved southward, but they never completely separated.  After watching the object for several minutes, I decided to drive through Boring, OR, to try to get a closer look.  I kept looking at it, as I drove, but then I lost sight of it before reaching Boring and never saw it again.  I returned to my prior vantage point, but it was gone.Since the object was in my view for the better part of a mile or more, it had to have been at least three or four miles distant and, given that distance, I would estimate the diameter of the cylinders to be 30 feet or more--perhaps much more.I cannot venture a good guess as to what the object was.  I have seen large tethered balloons used to call attention to sales, grand openings, etc.  But unlike tethered balloons this object was moving, albeit slowly, and I saw no other indication of such an event taking place.I work seasonally as a biologist or a biological science technician.

Mind you my father-in-law worked in law enforcement for 25+ years here in our town.  He has actually witnessed a small plane go down.

I myself checked, and found the same thing.  It was slowly moving west when the third object, also a burnt orange appeared.  It made a triangle formation, but a very long triangle, before form a line.  The object in back started to slowly fade out over the course of maybe 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing.  Soon after, the object in front did the same thing, thus leaving only the one in the middle. after about a minute, it too did the same.  Myself and my brother quickly ran home and told our mother.  She thought it was a joke, but soon realized we were serious.  She was on the phone with my sister and my father.  I went back out onto the street and looked around, seeing the fourth object.  This was unlike the first three.  It was much larger, maybe even three times the size of the other three.  It was also a very pale blue and white hue, almost completely white.  It just sat in the sky, maybe about 1000 to 1500 feet up.  I ran inside and told my brother and mother, who each ran outside with me. It was gone. We looked for a while afterwords, but saw nothing.  About an hour and a half later, still very perplexed by the event, I took out one of my dogs to use the bathroom again.  I was just down the street when my dog, who doesn't ever make any mean gesture towards anything, started growling and barking at nothing.  I turned around to go home, as I was kind of, not scared, but not excited either.  I just wanted to be home.  When I got inside, my mom said I had been gone a while.  It had felt only five minutes had passed, but they said it was about 30 minutes.  Since then I've been having strange dreams, and dreams i can only barely remember.

They were as bright or maybe slightly dimmer than the north star (opposite direction in the sky so a true visual comparison was not possible.  However, I did look briefly behind me to use it as a general basis for comparison).  The lights appeared out of no where and appeared to move independently for the first minute we saw them.

The object was hovering over the far right side of the new Santander bank, while high up, it was considerably low, its worth mentioning that if you are formulaic with this area of Cranston/Warwick you would know that this area is VERY heavy with air traffic, I see dozens of planes of all types and sizes every week night and day, it was very obvious and clear that this was no satellite or aircraft.As I begin to head down Broad. st to get home (I am walking) the object seems to move very slowly to the right, than heads not straight up, but forward away from my direction the opposite way and dims out as it hits a dense dark cloud.I take a right turn down Grand Ave, right off of Broad.

I try to keep pace with the object as it starts to enter another large dense, dark, natural cloud...  I've never seen anything like this as it literally made my heart beat go crazy and I got a slight adrenalin rush, the whole time while observing the object I kept telling myself that it was real and I was seeing it, like I described before, the object started out as a very bright, streetlight colored star that was very low and very obviously out of place, when I seen it the second time it was drastically lower, I could make out the shape to be sort of like a football, the color remained that solid old streetlight, orange with a very bright glow around it, I've described the thing to people as a flying streetlight with out the pole.

2899,"Strange light moving in an odd pattern above high voltage power transmission lines.On the evening of 23 December, 2015, I was returning home after a rip to our local department store.  As I was parking our car in the front yard, I noticed a small bright light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a navigational light on an aircraft.  I live under the direct flight path of aircraft flying to and from Pittsburgh International, Washington-Dulles, and several other major airports in the area.  But I have never seen aircraft lights move like this light did.This light although very bright and small moved from right to left, left to right, up and down, from side to side and corner to corner.  It did not change speed or slow down to make these sudden movements.I thought I was seeing things, so I yelled to my wife to come out onto the front porch.  She asked what I needed and I told her about the light.  I showed her where to look to see the light and she confirmed what I had seen.She then called my three sons to come onto the porch and look at the light.  Two of my sons and my eleven year old grand –daughter then came outside on the front porch.  They also confirmed the light and its odd movement.  We all agreed it was no aircraft that we knew of.I worked for ((deleted--aviation company)) for almost thirty years after serving a tour of duty with the ((deleted--aviation/military)).  I have traveled around the world and have flown in all types of aircraft from a Cessna 150, an F4-Phanton to Boeing 747, and never have been in, or flown in any aircraft that moved like this light did.  My third son also served a tour with the ((military)) air wing but he would not comment on what he saw.We did notice one thing strange about the light and its movements though.  We live near a 500,000 and I am told a 750,000 volt power line that run side by side near our home.  From where we were located and where the light seemed to be, it appeared to be moving above these power lines.I have waited to check on these lights again, but the weather has not been cooperative and every evening since seeing this light the sky has been overcast.  I will continue to look for the light when I get a chance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2900,"Square or diamond shaped object hovering and moving very fast over Rochester, NY.  12/23/15 7:30 p.m. ETI was walking into an apartment building and noticed a very bright green light sitting still in the sky at what appeared to be maybe 7 to 10 thousand feet high.  Just based on the brightness of the light and the fact that it was sitting stationary in the sky,  I immediately pulled out my phone and started filming.  I then watched for the next 12 or 13 minutes as this thing blew my mind.  It appeared to be square, or diamond in shape.  It changed from green to red then back to green in no real pattern.  It did not make a sound.  It traveled from one side of the city to the entire other in under 10 seconds.  It dropped so low that it was out of my sight for a few minutes, then rose as if someone had a string attached to it and yanked it upward.  I would say 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet in under 3 seconds.  As it got close enough to me to really make it out I could tell the body of it was black, there were four huge perfect circle lights on the bottom, two red and two green, but at times there would be either no green or no red.  I also saw a flashing white or maybe even amber colored light on the back?  Maybe front?  I am basing the size on a passenger jet which flew through the same vicinity as the craft moments after it disappeared which I also caught on video and I would say that it was half to 3/4 the size of the airplane which was a full size jet plane.  It also appeared to be traveling 15 to 20 times faster than that plane which was descending to land and much much higher.  This happened in Rochester NY and I witnessed it from the suburb Greece, NY.  It was mostly south of my location, but at times traveled far enough north east (in under 10 seconds mind you) that I had to turn my whole body and face Irondequoit, NY, which is east of Greece, to keep recording it.  I stopped a passing car and asked the young lady to look up and tell me what she sees so I know i'm not going crazy and she watched it for about 5 seconds, said oh my God that's a ufo!  I said thank u for confirming and she promptly pulled away as if she was nervous.  The craft made a lot of erratic movements.  Stopping on a dime, zig zag patterns at times, shifting as if on an axis.  At one point it started heading right at me and had me nervous enough to start walking back towards the apartment building for safety.  It was acting as if it were investigating or searching for something.  Truly a life altering experience for me, felt absolutely nothing like a drone which is the infamous explanation i'm getting for this.  I own a drone.  I know what they can do.  I know there's a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and uses for them.  This was not that.  Oh and I don't know if this relevant or not but I experienced a really bad headache about an hour after the event which would not go away to the point that I had to take tylenol for it.  I NEVER EVER have headaches that lead me to have to medicate.  Cannot remember one time in life.

I would estimate a velocity of under 20K km/hr but greater than 5K km/hr.  The fireball appeared over the coast range of mountains to the northeast at an elevation of about 25 degrees.  It proceeded on a level trajectory for a very long minute and a half or so to the SSE. It did not dim or brighten until the end of the ionization track at which point the somewhat fuzzy ion track appeared to break up and spray out a little as it dimmed and went out.  This ion source did not leave a trail of any kind, it burned through the sky and was gone.  Other fireball meteors I have seen have left ion trails and sometimes smoke trails.  This one didn't. Would this suggest a (nuke power perhaps?)  satellite reentry?  Most likely not as I would expect a significant glowing smoke trail at this time of day.

2923,"Apparently high altitude dark amber light with a tail moving in a straight line from west to east, 6:08 pm  to 6:10 pm, Lafayette, Ca.One dark amber light about the same (apparent) altitude, size and speed of the ISS crossed almost directly overhead moving from west to east as seen from my location in the center of downtown Lafayette, CA.  I first noticed it overhead at 6:08 PM as it was still coming from the western nighttime sky and it continued toward the east in a straight line.  I continued to watch it until it reached the eastern horizon. In the moonlight I noticed it had a tail, possibly a smoke trail, which was long, light colored, and straight extending backwards a long way. once I saw the tail and because of its relatively slow speed, I realized it was probably not be ISS because a smoke trail would not appear the same as it does in our atmosphere.  Due to its slow speed, I assume it could not have been a meteor. The object's color could possibly be described as a fire viewed from a great distance which makes sense because it had what appeared as a smoke trail behind it. it had no b! linking lights and did not change in color even as it reached the eastern horizon. It also appeared as though it were at high altitude based on observations of many aircraft over my lifetime. I could not hear any sound from it. Note; because of my swing shift hours of work at a dark hilltop secure location from which I am now retired, I have witnessed many ISS crossings at night as well as one very striking meteor as it was breaking up, over the years.

2927,What ever it was that flew by me I for sure have never seen before.It was 6:05 pm when I was walking from my next door neighbor's house towards my house when I looked up and saw a round or egg shape ball of light coming very fast up in the sky. It must have been going 1500-2500 knots.  I stopped to watch it as it flew like a missile or a rocket ball that had tracer light streaming behind it.  It flew at an angle up and over the direction of Travis Air Force Base.  My neighbor and I both watched it slow down to a stop and appeared to be angled down as we could see light coming out of it. We both agreed that it was egg or round in shape.  There was no sound at all and it seemed to be about the same size as a four door car.  We both kept walking following behind it as not to loose it. It flew a distance I see plains fly all the time accept plains take about 5-10 minutes do fly the same distance. I could not believe what I was seeing. I went in my house to document what I had just seen and I found my digital recorder and tried to go! back over everything that we witnessed. When I went back outside from the original event it was 6:25 pm it is now 7:30 pm as I am writing this report and I just herd sirens like police with a weird humming and now I am hearing a loud airplane engine as I look there is what looks like a boing 777 flying in a big circle around my house and area where the said event took place.((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.

2931,"Hopefully a fragment of a comet or a meteor.I believe my girlfriend and I witnessed a meteor fragment enter the atmosphere between 5:55 and 6:15 p.m. on the night of December the 22nd 2015.  I was speaking to her while she sat facing the east in a SUV and kept seeing flashes of light which she claimed she did not notice.  Believing it must be someone fooling with us, we ignored my curiosity.  However within a few minutes after seeing the flashes of light, I noticed a bright object which came from the West, from California in a star burst pattern.  If you can imagine looking directly at a firework bursting before you, that is what it looked like.  The color was golden to white.  It was so large it was startling.  Being as we are so nervous about terrorists, I almost thought it was a missile, but as it neared and I shouted at her to get out of the SUV and look up at the sky it began to resemble some type of long comet or meteor soaring very close to earth on a bit of a east southeastern direction.  Or as the ! crow flies, towards Phoenix.  It remained visible until it left our horizon line or about two minutes or less.  Once she left and went home about four minutes later I heard a loud boom from the direction which it flew.  Since we both sighted flying orange red orbs over Bullhead City, Arizona, just a few months ago.  It is interesting that so many things abound in the skies around here.

My suspicions were raised when I realized no sound was being emitted, contrary to my initial belief that they were military helicopters in formation.  As the four of them passed overhead, the second to the vanguard diminished in brightness and in doing so began emitting a redder light until finally it disappeared.  I then noticed more movement to the North and observed a fifth apparently catching up because of it's slightly higher rate of speed.  At this point there were only four and all continued in the same vector at the same speed.

2957,"Large bright light in night sky, motionless, it did not belong in the sky.December 19th, 2015.I went to bed as I usually do at just after 11:00pm. Because of a medical issue I get up often through the night.  It was at this point the date is technically now December 20th, 2015 3:00 a.m.  My staircase stops at the front door and out that door window I have seen the same night sky for a very long time now.  But this time there was an extra light out the door window pointing to the North West.I live in the country there are not lost of extra lights, we have very active night life of coyotes, deer, and many other animals.  This light I noticed was very bright, at first I thought maybe it was a planet but this object grew in brightness, grew extremely bright. But it was motionless and as I watch it a plane very far off blinking red light so I assume it was a plane far in the sky.  This other object was still motionless but what seemed to be too low in the sky to be a star also this was normally a blank space in the clear night sky.  There should not have been an object there and has not every night since.  I went back to bed after watching this object for about ten minutes.  Again the time is now approximately, December 20th, 2015 3:10 a.m.  I pass a stove clock on my night trip to the bathroom so I see the time each time I get up.I again got up as I do this time it was just after 4:00 a.m. December 20th, 2015 and I took notice that the object was gone not out the front door window North West.  This time I took a quick shower as I itch often so bad I need to shower just to be able to relieve the itching, it is all part of a recovery from a bone marrow transplant.  I got out and checked the time so I knew how long before my wife would be waking; it would be Sunday Morning December 20th, 2015 when we got up and the sun was up.  So again it is almost 4:30 a.m. December 20th, 2015, I have to the South East a wall of windows and looked out to see is there was any snow falling?  No, still too warm, very unseasonably warm for the North where I am.  It is at this time I notice that object from the front door window is now out my South East Window, this is not the direction the stars or moon moves in as they travel the night sky, so this right off tells me there is something different about this object.I call to my wife upstairs to come down and take a look.  This object is so bright and motionless and again too low in the sky from the horizon perspective to be a planet or star and it is far brighter than all the other stars.  And now each night I look for this object, if it were something regularly in the night sky I expect I should see it but, I have not.  It was there it was very big and bright, to me it looked the size about what looked like a ¼ of the size of the moon which was not yet out as the full moon is still to come for this month.  Compared to other objects in the night sky this was huge and bright and did not move while I watched it.  I watched it for about 15 minutes this second time and it just got very bright then would get very dim, once it did seem to just go out but then came back on, this was a very white light in that is seemed to appear to be so white I could see other colors of the spectrum in it like neon green, yellow, very lite blue.  Today is December! 24th, 2015 and still no sign of it in the sky, I wonder was this my very first sighting?  I can-not explain what it was and it did not seem to belong there.

I was looking at it facing north, looking up over my house.There were no propellers, so it could not have been a drone, and no sound.  It was approximately 300 ft. above my house and if I were to estimate width, I would say maybe  20 to 30 feet wide.I was the only witness and I watched it for about 1 to 2 minutes.  Here is another additional part to my story.I have followed the UFO media reports for quite a few years and always thought  that  it would be great  to see one, to validate for myself that they exist.

At one point they were facing in my direction and i thought the object was coming my way.  I called my sister in law outside to take a look with me. She confirmed my suspicion that it was not a plane or a star.  It was too close to us to be a star, and a star wouldn't have two bright lights facing us.  It faded out again towards the west, like going straight backwards almost, until it was completely out of sight.  It then came back into view and stayed for maybe another ten minutes and the lights once again became really bright,almost like they were coming to us and fading in and out.  The lights were white,  I did not see colors, or was too far away to see any colors.  I never did come back so i went inside.  This was all in a pitch black sky, we are out in the country with only one street light.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Mr Davenport,We ourselves asked the same question.

2981,"Bright light changed to blue, green white, was seen over Downtown Minneapolis from North MinneapolisSighting lasted from 9:30-9:48 pm (18-20 minutes)  Started out as a brighter than usual light that looked like a big bright star in the southeastern sky in North Minneapolis.  It was a clear night with stars visible and with few clouds in the night sky. It seemed like it (the light) was almost directly over the downtown Minneapolis area, it was a bright light somewhat at airplane altitude,that changed colors, or at least it seemed to, it was white and blue and green at times, it looked like it was constantly changing colors.  Was bigger than the common commercial drone since I was able to see it from north Minneapolis and it was about the size of a pea or smaller, so a pea would block it completely if held up at arms length.  It had many strange movements that caught my eye while I was outside picking up food. It stayed stationary and moved left to right across the sky very slowly. It then stopped moving and stayed stationary until it started moving slowly upwards while staying in the same place ascending towards a bunch of clouds in the upper layer of the sky.The light stayed there for a long time just underneath the clouds. I had time to  go back inside my house and so I watched it from the window until it slowly went upwards again towards the layer of clouds which by that time the clouds had become thicker and had been moved by the wind towards the downtown area. So it basically disappeared into the clouds while slowly ascending towards what seemed to me upwards towards the stratosphere.There was no sound,I did see what I believe to be two helicopters or aircraft flying through the area further northeast of the object around the same time frame, they only had red lights not the usual green-go, white and red-stop lights that I'm used to seeing when other hospital helicopters fly by. Experience was strange and exiting, I felt very excited since it was out of the usual night sky and I believe that there is life in other planets.",Duration:18 minutes,"Location: North Minneapolis, MN",Occurred : 12/17/2015 21:30  (Entered as : 12/17/15 21:30),Posted: 12/21/2015,Reported: 12/18/2015 11:39:48 PM 23:39,Shape: Light

2983,"TWO DISC SHAPED UFO'S CHANGING FROM RED TO GREEN IN MADISON, MS.Last night Thursday, December 17th, 2015, (7:00 PM).  I ran into Walgreen's in Madison, MS, leaving my father in the car, when I returned I apologized for taking so long (10 min.), his reply was that’s ok, I have been watching the weirdest things in the sky, he said look over there and where he pointed there were two disc shaped objects with lights changing from red to green.  They looked like they were hovering over Home Depot, it put chills all over me!  We sat there a few more minutes (7:15 PM) and decided to leave and go out of the city where there would be no light pollution to watch them.  We drove about a mile and lost them, after getting to an area that was dark and a clear shot of the sky we parked and looked for another 5 or so minutes without seeing anything, I then left heading west after a couple of miles I turned back east and drove to a top of a hill where we saw them again (7:35 PM), they were much further away to the west and not as close together but were stationary and changing from red, green to white.  There were several planes in the sky so you could defiantly tell they were not planes.After another 5 or so minute’s they shot off to the West.  I decided to report this sighting after my father called me to tell me someone from the Madison Airport reported seeing several UFO’s last night.  This is not my first time seeing this type of thing, I grew up about 15 miles west of Madison, MS, and in the time I lived in Flora, MS (21 yrs.) I saw more than I can count Unidentified Flying Objects mostly in the Big Black River bottom west of town.  There have been several national stories done on all of the UFO sightings in that area.  This is the first time in 28-30 years I have seen any, but knowing from many years ago you could see a lot of them for a few months and then not see any for months or longer.  I believe if you will watch you will continue to see them for a while.

3011,"Early a.m. spherical UFOs chase high-flying airliner.At approximately 8:30 am, Dec 12, 2015, I was outside my home, waiting for a co-worker to pick me up for work.  It was a very mild & breezy morning & the sky was mostly clear except for some clouds here and there.  As I'm usually want to do when outside,I enjoy the nice sky.  This morning I noticed an airliner very high up, at a guess anywhere between 10-20,000 feet traveling in a roughly east east-westerly direction.  As a I watched it, a glint of light far behind it caught my eye.  I suddenly saw 5 gleaming spherical objects trailing the airliner going the same direction at approximately 1-1+1/2 miles.  The objects were keeping pace with the airliner & were in a ""diamond"" type formation with the closest object behind the airliner being the ""bottom tip"" of the diamond & the other four, one each, at the ""points"" of the diamond.  All objects traveled in the exact same direction & were equidistantly spread apart one from another, perhaps hund! reds of feet.  At no time during the brief sighting did they speed up, slow down, change direction, move away from their positions or ""phase"" out of view.  I immediately ruled out the possibility of high flying birds as all the objects were visibly flying, at some points, ABOVE the highest cloud layer, which the airliner was also doing.  If they were birds at that height (which as a far as I know, birds don't fly that high) they would've been far too small to see with the naked eye & certainly would not reflect a metallic gleam as these objects did.  Also, being that far above a cloud layer that high, as I saw their shape, they would've been FAR too large to be birds.   If I had to guess  at their size at that distance in order to be seen from the ground the way I did, they would've had to have been at least a hundred feet in diameter apiece.  As mentioned, the sighting was very brief, merely a minute and a half or so.  I was anxiously awaiting my co-workers arrival to h!elp me verify my sighting but sadly, he arrived literally a few seconds after they & the airliner they were tailing, all disappeared into the distance.

3022,"Five, non-blinking red lights in triangle or A configuration, East Bay Area.Monday night December 14th, I went out to check my car at midnight before going to bed.As the crow flies, I'm about a mile from the edge of the San Francisco Bay.If I look down my street in that direction, (west), I can see the big planes flying low, alongside the shoreline on their final approach to Oakland Airport.I also see the planes climbing out of Hayward Airport just to my south.

3024,"This event was actually two related sightings on the same night at locations that were within 10 minutes of each other.The first sighting occurred at approximately 10:35 pm on Monday, 12/14/2015.  I was driving my car, turning right onto Cropley Ave. from Conifer Ln. in San Jose, CA.  As I looked left to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, I noticed quite a bright ""star"" streaking toward the easterly direction.  It lasted less than two seconds, tracing across perhaps a fifth of the sky.My first reaction was that I had seen a meteor.  But the object wasdefinitely a small round disc (like a golf ball seen at about 30 feet away).  The luminosity was similar to that of an LED light and, although moving rather fast, it did not exhibit a ""tail"" as the natural light from a meteor would do.  As I made the turn and continued to drive, I really didn't think anything more about it.My drive proceeded southwesterly along Cropley to Morrill Ave., turning right on Morrill to get to Landess Ave., where I then turned left.  Landess heads roughly westward and turns into Montague Expressway after the Highway 680 overcrossing.  I proceded southwestward down Montague, crossing over Highway 880, until I stopped at a red light at either Zanker Rd. or N. 1st St. (I'm not sure which one.)  The time was approximately 10:45 pm and it was here that I saw the golf-ball object again while looking up to the left through the windshield at about a 40 to 45 degree angle.  Instead of streaking as it did before, it made a sort of randomly ""hilly"" curve in the sky that lasted about as long as the first sighting.I was rather surprised, however, to see that (in the background sky of the golf-ball object) there were (I believe) eight lights of much lesser intensity than the golf-ball.  Each light was (as best I can describe it) shaped kind of like a flattened diamond.The most noticeable feature of these lights, to me, was that they were divided into two rows of four lights each, one row below the other by perhaps 5 to 10 degrees, from my vantage point.  Each row's lights were evenly spaced, and the bottom row's lights were aligned directly below the top row's.  The lights alternately dimmed and intensified, in unison, with a period of perhaps two to three seconds.As I stared at the configuration, I thought it might be due to an optical artifact of the area's street lights reflecting on my windshield.  But I rolled down my window and stuck my head outside to look; they were still there.It also occurred to me that there could be Christmas lights on the top edge of a nearby building.  I wouldn't be able to see the building because it was night and the brighter street lights would interfere with any ambient backlighting behind the dark building.  However, at the angle and direction I was looking (~ 45 degrees up, southward), no buildings are that tall when one takes into account the distance between my stopped car at the intersection, and any building to the south.Finally, the lights could not lie on a possible power line because both rows were arranged absolutely ruler straight, whereas there would likely be a slight bow in the arrangement if attached to a power line (due to line sag).The whole sighting at the stopped light on Montague probably lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.  Just before my traffic light turned green, there were (I believe) three other cars at the intersection: one next to me on the right, one in the opposite direction that was beginning a turn northward onto the cross street, and one waiting on my left on the cross street, at his red light.  I looked to see if I could detect any awareness of the unidentified lights by the person on my right, but it was difficult to see the driver inside the car.  It seemed as if no one else noticed.The sighting was over when each row of lights split in half, two lights accelerating to the right, two accelerating to the left.  The intensity of the lights quickly dimmed to zero as their speed increased, and they never deviated from their ruler straight horizontal paths.BACKGROUND OF WITNESS: ---------- -- -------  A.B., Physics, U.C.

3025,"Thin ""streak"" of light, white/yellow/red banding.I had just exited the rear door of my house (faces north) and was heading toward my camper (which I keep parked in my backyard.)  I was walking across my backyard headed in a north-easterly direction.  I looked up in the sky, towards my right, at the constellation Orion. It was a clear night.  No clouds in the sky at all.  I had just located the three stars in his “belt” when I noticed a streak of light in the sky to my right.I turned just in time to see the light, which was heading downward towards the ground, disappear behind the roof of my house.  It began approximately 60 degrees above the horizon in the southern sky.  It traced a straight path downward and angled slightly to the west.  The whole event lasted only a second or two.I have seen meteors and fireworks and such.  I also have my private pilot's license and work in an aviation-based industry so I am familiar with aircraft lighting.  This was definitely not an aircraft and it didn't appear to be a meteor either.What was peculiar was the coloration. It could be described as a streak of light. The upper portion was white, then there was a band of yellow, and, finally, the portion closest to the ground was red. From my vantage point, the streak was only a few millimeters thick, but was 10 centimeters or so in length. This gave me the impression it was dozens of kilometers away. It disappeared behind the roof of my house. I paused for a moment to see if it would return and I walked around the side of the house to a less obstructed view to see if, perhaps, it had “crashed” and created a fireball. The object did not make any noise, but that didn't surprise me as I stated earlier it appeared to be at a good distance away from me. I saw nothing further that night. I know the time to be 10:17pm as I looked at the clock when I entered my camper.  Today, I have searched the internet and local news outlets to see if, perhaps, someone else had reported the event and it could be easily explained as a meteor or some space “junk”, but as yet I have not come across any other sightings.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??

However, these were no stars seeing as these lights were a vibrant, dark, green.   I looked it up and saw that it is impossible for a star to be green, plus not all of them were being covered by clouds.  3 out of the 4 had disappeared, maybe by clouds?  So now afraid that I was running out of time I asked my sister to come up stairs and look at them. She confirmed the light and as she was looking I saw 3 more of the same lights exept these ones were closer to the horizon and dawned just above a roof top.  These ones are a lot harder to spot than the first one I saw from the original 4.

3064,"Two oval objects heading fast towards the west over Palm Desert.Driving west on Fred Waring in Palm Desert,  I saw two disk-shaped objects in the clear sky.  They were headed relatively fast towards west, seemed to be quite high up in the air, and I couldn’t hear any sound.  (I was in a car so that may have been the reason.)  The two objects were close to each other and kept the same distance and configuration.  They were both identical in appearance:  Oval, dark in color, somewhat metallic looking.  At the time, I and the driver of the car had no idea what they may be.  They didn’t look like anything I had seen before, and I couldn’t think of anything known they could be.  They went too fast for being a balloon.  They were definitely not birds.  It was daylight so they were not obviously planets or meteors.  They were not civilian drones since they went fast and continued over the mountains.  They did not have the shape of any airplane I have seen.Thinking back now, it is possible that they were two helicopters and we didn’t see the rotors or any of the things normally protruding from helicopters.  It’s possible, but it does seem unlikely that we wouldn’t have seen any of those things and the perfect oval shape of both objects didn’t fit the shape of helicopters I have seen.  It is possible that they were military drones flying in perfect formation and with no visible or audible form of propulsion.  I don’t know if military drones comes in a perfectly oval shape.

3102,"three stationary golden sun reflecting objects, the closest appeared to be a long, narrow rectangle, observed for 10 minuesI was driving at sunrise south on Highway 95 and had passed through Parker, Az. and was about 10 miles out of town southbound when I noticed 3 bright golden lights stationary to the east.  I can only guess that they were probably 15 miles away and seemingly low,  just a couple thousand feet up in the sky.  The sun was still below the horizon, but was brightly coming up generally in the eastern direction of these objects and the golden color was as if the objects were metalic and reflecting the sunrise light, being vivid and bright.  Right away it struck me that this looked odd.  There were high thin obvious clouds to the east that stretched quite aways north to south, but they weren't thick enough to obscure some very distant jet traffic that could be seen a few times that would be consistent with jets leaving from the Phoenix airport.  Those jets were very far off, barely discernible other than their contrail, but you could note they were going up from groun! d level and angling up to the north at typical angles and speeds for commercial jets to take off on.  I didn't figure that the commercial jets were anywhere near these three objects, but much further away, and likely would not have seen them.While the far off jet traffic was playing out in the background, it emphasized the stationary manner and proximity of the three low and bright golden objects.  The object that appeared to be closest to me, but not far from the other two objects that were slightly above and behind from my vantage point, appeared to be a long, thin rectangle of golden light with the long flat side being parallel to the ground as if level to it. The rectangle wasn't very tall relative to it's length and would be like this symbol --- proportionally.  The other two objects were in a somewhat tight grouping with the rectagle, but were further away and I could not see any shape in that they were just bright golden circles, difficult to focus on for any detail.I was on vacation and carrying a camera in my car and knew that I should get a photo of these.  There wasn't a very good place to pull over at first, but I knew there was gonna be a stop in a mile or so where State Highway 72 meets Highway 95 and I intended to stop there and do a photograph, but I was also anticipating that when I got on Hwy 72 I would be heading directly towards these objects and that if they remained in place for another 10 minutes of driving time I'd probably be getting pretty close under them for a closer view.When I came around the bend of the road where the highways meet and I'd intended to take a photograph, I was surprised to see an Az. State Trooper pulled across my lane, blocking it with a few orange cones out at the Highway 72 intersection.  It could have been because of an accident down the road, and in retrospect I probably should have asked him, but as I drove up to ask him if indeed that road was closed he was seemingly perturbed because I had driven up to his vehicle and not just turning down the alternative highway. (95 toward Quartzsite).  I didn't ask him about the lights that I'm sure he could have seen from his vantage point.  I had to do a kinda funny maneuver then to get on to 95 southbound then and hoped he wouldn't give me a ticket, but he probably couldn't leave his post.  As soon as I was on that other road a ridge started rising up and within a minute cut off my view of those objects so I never got a photo.  Had I been able to get on that Hwy 72 the next town in about 10 miles is called Bouse, and I think that those objects were just a bit north of the highway and not far from Bouse. I observed these stationary objects for about 10 minutes and I never saw any movement.  I looked at your site to see if there were any other collaborative report and see that someone saw something moving on the ground in the same general area at about the same time, so I decided to also report what I saw.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Parker, AZ",Occurred : 12/10/2015 07:45  (Entered as : 12/10/15 7:45),Posted: 12/21/2015,Reported: 12/19/2015 10:42:55 PM 22:42,Shape: Rectangle

3124,"At approximately 17:00 on December 7, 2015, I was about to get into my car to pick up my girlfriend to attend a Christmas party when I noticed a bright orange/yellow orb in the sky directly east of Nelson, NH.  The orb seemed to be traveling away from me, toward the east, at a distance of several miles from my position, approximately 20 degrees above the horizon. It traveled at the same rate a speed a satellite would.  This sighting lasted only about 30 seconds. Later that night, after being dropped off by friends with whom we carpooled to the Christmas party, my girlfriend and I got into our car and headed north on Route 12, heading toward the city of Keene.  At the junction of Route 12 and Flat Roof Mill Road I noticed a bright orange orb hanging in the sky to the left of our position.  I pulled over to get a better look.  My girlfriend could not see the object from the passenger's side, so I pulled her over toward me until she could see it.  The orb was traveling south at a distance of perhaps a mile from our position, at an estimated altitude of 1,500-2,000 feet.  Estimated speed was 25-30 mph.  Looking at it through binoculars I could see that the orb had an aura about it, with a bright orange center. I was convinced at that point that what I was looking at was a Chinese lantern.  I put down the binoculars and continued to observe it as it made a slow change of direction, away from us, heading now west.   The turn continued until now th! e object was traveling north, and nearly at twice the distance at which we first observed it.  The maneuver lasted about one minute. It was now heading north, against the prevailing breeze.  After watching it travel for another minute or so, it vanished abruptly.Were it not for the fact that the object changed direction, I would not be reporting this sighting, nor the one from earlier that evening.  Having myself investigated independently the UFO phenomenon for over 30 years on two continents, I've become a bit of a skeptic, and am convinced that a great number of sightings are the result of misidentification.  The meteorological conditions that evening were clear, with a light north-south breeze.This is the third time I've observed orange orbs transiting the sky in this region: the first time was two years ago, at approximately 3am.  This orb moved faster, at an estimated speed of 80-100 mph, at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet, traveling east to west, at a distance of approximately five miles from my vantage point.  Said observation was from inside my home, through a window facing north.  The intensity of the light remained constant throughout the period it was visible, with no other lights visible, until it disappeared in the distance.Let me be clear that I have observed on many occasions aircraft on approach to Manchester Airport, something which at first glance sometimes resembles these orbs (as the aircraft travels directly toward the observer it can lend the illusion that it is a stationary luminous object), and am acutely aware of how common it is for people to mistakenly report these as UFOs.  I also monitor air traffic via an application on my smartphone, which provides accurate aircraft ID and flight information, with the exception of military aircraft.",Duration:5-7 minutes,"Location: Keene, NH",Occurred : 12/7/2015 22:35  (Entered as : 12/71/15 22:35),Posted: 1/5/2016,Reported: 12/30/2015 7:28:49 PM 19:28,Shape: Light

3134,"Orange lights and shape-changing pale jelly-fish-looking object seen in South Tracy.At due north in the sky on 12/6 at 7:45PM, three people witnessed a bright glowing orange roundish object, approximately 30-45 degrees from horizon in the northwest sky.  Two minutes after first observing the object, it separated into two pieces, with the smaller piece at 5:00 relative to the larger.  The smaller piece dimmed after a few seconds of appearing and went out and the larger piece continued to glow orange.  After a few seconds, the larger object appeared to decrease in size and brightness.  Then the larger object dimmed and disappeared.  After a couple of seconds, it suddenly brightened to same original intensity and then after a second or two it dimmed back to a faint orange glow.  It then disappeared again.  While this was going on, a strong beam of light from the North East flashed from the ground toward the object.  This happened a couple of times for a period of a few seconds.  Within a minute of the orange object disappearing, in the same gener! al area, we then saw what appeared to be a white translucent jellyfish like object, which at first was traveling slowly in a due south path directly towards us.  It came almost directly overhead and it slowly took a north easterly path and continued to take that path until it disappeared from view.  All three of us got a good look with binoculars.  Under the binoculars, object was pale white, translucent, shape-shifting.  It looked like a jellyfish that can change its form. The shapes were not discernible, nor symmetric, almost like random shapes, but very broadly changed from being roughly spherical to more flat and back to spherical, with protrusions sometimes coming out.  Was very easy to see changing of shapes with the naked eye as well.  Seemed large maybe 50 to 100+ feet in diameter, but very difficult to say how large with any confidence.   The changing of the shape appeared to be unlikely due to wind alone (like a balloon) as far we could tell considering very low wi! nd speed (we looked online and there was a 4mph gust north eas! t wind).There was no wind we could feel (trees were completely still).  The object was changing shape much more quickly than what seemed possible due to wind alone.  Object also seemed to be moving noticeably faster in the northeast direction than what seemed possible by wind alone (although the low wind was blowing in the direction it disappeared from our view).  Estimated altitude, very difficult to say, no clouds for altitude reference, but probably between 1000–4000 feet.

He called me and my wife outside and we saw it too.  I made a video with my Canon T3i camera (18-135mm) and also with my phone (galaxy s6).  The object was moving pretty slowly and it first went up (in relation to where we were) and then it went down again, so we had to walk toward west to see it better.I ran inside and grabbed our telescope (Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ) with a 10mm view scope.  It took about 4 minutes to focus it but I did.  At first it looked like a white football with lights across it, but as my eyes rested I saw it was the shape of an Oreo Cookie, with either lights or reflective material through the middle of it.  The lights on the right were shinier (probably because it was facing the sun).It seemed to be very far away and through the viewscope it was about 1"" big.As we were looking at it neighbors who were driving by stopped and looked through the telescope too.  I then called my brother in law who lives about 1 mile away and he confirmed seeing the white dot in the sky too.Finally we decided to drive to a higher location as we were worried the object was going to go behind the trees, by the time we got there (1.5 miles away) we could no longer find it.

I take pics of this one also.  Then, I see way above those wispy contrail clouds another trail forming but no jet until it comes out from above those wispy contrails.  I see it's a jet going north also but this jet was moving way faster than the other two so I snapped a couple of pics of that one.It was heading north fast so I barely got a couple of shots when I lowered the camera I looked over the woods to the north in the same direction as the fast flying contrail jet and there I see a formation of metalic flashing and glittering round objects flying south in a line formation as if a V had one side cut off looking like this \.I was excited and tried to guess there were at least 8 to 10 round flashing objects in a line like this \ moving south quickly.  I raised the camera, tried to get them focused on the view screen but couldn't find anything so began to snap pics wildly as they flew over head and to the south.These round objects were roughly about 2 thousand feet above the woods, totally silent and over head as they flew south.  I kept snapping pics and hoped I got something.  It lasted maybe 5 seconds but I can be more accurate by looking at the first time stamp shot to the last time stamp shot as they were just even with my southern roof line.I think I got 6 or 7 shots and 3 have the objects.  One shot was the first facing north as they came south, then one over head and the last over my roof line facing south.  I went in the house and checked the time which was 11:03 so it was around 10:56 am when all this began.Although I could see round objects glittering and flashing as if metalic flying south into the sun,  The camera shots came out as round gray objects with bright spots on the objects.They were fast and they were silent.

This was observed for about 20 seconds.  It was an extremely bright light, unlike anything else they had ever observed in the night sky before.There were other aircraft visible in the night sky and they were more distant, so the orange light appeared to be much lower down.

At one point, the light seemed to become stationary, gained altitude, then grew dimmer and eventually vanished.Approximately ten minutes later, while the family was still gazing out, a second slightly more intense light appeared.

It moved too slowly to notice movement w/my bare eyes unless I was still & comparing its location to a roof gutter above me.  Via a monocular at times some markings that looked like a very blurred ""Boys and Girls Clubs of America"" logo were on it.  Other times it looked like the moon with blurred craters but it was much too small to be the moon.  Could not tell if it was 1000's of feet up or many miles up. There was no ground wind.  It was tough to hold the monocular still.  Had bluish top left edge & reddish bottom right edge.  Was not 'smoothly' round.  Had a barely visible heat distortion or exhaust on left & right sides (shown above).The object later became a faded orange before disappearing in the dark sky.

3186,"Multiple lights: flashing, speeding, flaring, and chasing each other.I don’t know how to measure the speed or distance of any flying objects.  I can only give a report relative to my own knowledge.I was driving on highway 116 in Texas, heading north toward Gatesville, around 8:10 pm (pure nighttime, clear skies and no visible moon).  To my right (northeast) in the sky there was a flare of orange light, it appeared to be a four-pointed diamond in the sky.  From my vantage point it looked about the size of headlight.  The shape then appeared to move in a horizontal fashion (left to right, or west to east) while multiplying, so that there appeared to be three aligned orange diamonds, before it merged into a single shape and then disappeared.  It was about midway in the sky, well above the treeline.  The spectacle lasted about five seconds.I pulled over and grabbed my phone, but it had already ended.  However, in its absence there were multiple moving lights, each about the size of a star.  There were suddenly about three or four of them in the northeast sky, all moving in different directions.  They were blinking rapidly like a strobe light and moving considerably faster than a plane.  There was also inexplicably a shooting star that flashed between them.  I got out of my car and tried to get video but they were too dim to be recorded.  I immediately noticed that to my left (northwest) there were even more of the fast moving blinking lights, about four more.  There was a rash of these blinking lights spread across the entire sky.  Unlike the diamond shape, which was still horizon-level, these lights were moving freely about much higher, like satellites.  It was admittedly hard to gauge their exact direction due to their strange lighting, but it still genuinely looked like they were disappearing and reappearing throughout the sky.I called my friend and observed the lights for about another ten minutes.  I saw what looked like a normal plane-large, slow-moving, and with green blinking lights- appear on the northwest, heading east.  Suddenly two more very bright, very big white lights appeared directly, distantly above me.  They were about plane sized.  They seemed to be high in the atmosphere but once again, I could easily be mistaken there.  The two lights were moving down, one heading toward east and another toward the west.  The westbound light suddenly made a sharp turn RIGHT, heading directly toward the other light.  There was a loud whirring sound, like a divebomb.  My friend on the phone heard it as well. It had a made a clear curving turn and accelerated.  It was chasing the eastbound light.  Combined with the noise and the pursuing object’s speed, I thought that I was going to witness a collision.  I hung up the phone to record-however, both lights (still heading east) then grew dim and diminished in size, until they disappeared.I continued to watch the skies for another twenty minutes.  While there was still an excess of moving lights (about four to six, ranging one eastern edge of the sky to the west), they were now dim and twinkling and unremarkable.  They all seemed to eventually vanish.  However, there was yet another orange diamond shape that erupted, the same size and location as the first one.  It simply flashed out a single orange gleam, and was gone.I waited another ten minutes, but nothing happened.  By now it was around nine o’ clock. I drove for another ten minutes to my destination.  While there I waited outside and continued to watch the stars.  Sure enough, in the east there was a blinking white light jetting across the sky toward the west.  This light was about plane sized.  About midway across (at the northern point) it suddenly seemed to stop, but it was in fact only moving very slowly.  It had very instantaneously dropped its speed- however the blinking rate of the lights was still the same.  It then slowly flew eastward until it was out of sight.Though I watched for more, nothing happened afterwards of note.",Duration:hour,"Location: Copperas Cove, TX",Occurred : 12/3/2015 20:10  (Entered as : 12/03/15 20:10),Posted: 12/4/2015,Reported: 12/3/2015 8:32:48 PM 20:32,Shape: Diamond

The same two witnesses saw what appeared to be the same UFO last night, at about 6 pm, in the same part of the sky.  This most recent sighting lasted about 2 minutes, and occurred near the northern horizon, which was the only patch of sky clear of clouds.A bright white light flashed a couple of times to the NNE, attracting our attention.  As we had had the previous sighting, I grabbed my binoculars to view this light, which we initially suspected to be an airliner.  Instead, I immediately saw that it was the same group of lights or object with several randomly flashing lights.  It was dim enough that it was only visible with the binoculars, once the bright white flashing light stopped flashing.The object moved west, estimated at about 200 mph, then disappeared behind the mountains to the north.  These mountains are about 8 miles from our house, and the object appeared to subtend 2 to 3 degrees of horizon.  This would give it a width of 1,800', if eight miles away.It did not have the legally required navigation and anti-collision lights that all aircraft must display during hours of darkness: red navigation light on left wing tip, green on right plus white anti-collision strobes.

3241,"Numerous triangular objects flying over the cornfieldsI was driving east down route 72.  I began my commute around 5:10 pm.  On the horizon I noted an extraordinary amount of “stars.”  Upon further thought, I dismissed them as planets as they seemed much too bright to be stars.  There was a cluster of three directly ahead of me.  When I looked to the left and right of them, I noted an unusual amount of points of light.  I thought it was peculiar.  One of the points of light, my so called “planet,” shot straight north.  That is when I told myself, “Oh. That’s no planet.  Planets don’t do that.”  Suddenly, the entire sky was nearly pitch-black.  The sunset had completed itself though it seemed faster than normal.I began watching the sky after I saw the “planet” shoot north.  I saw a flying object, triangular in shape.  It had light on the three points (red and white).  The lights were solid and then they began to flash, almost mimicking an airplane.  Then another object appeared.  I had stopped at the red light at the intersection of 72 and 47, headed east, towards Elgin, Illinois.At the light, I starred at the sky and kept watching the flying objects.  Once I cleared the stoplight, I pulled over the side of the road, slightly pass the John Deere place.I exited my vehicle and looked at the night sky.  Some of the flying objects looked like airplanes, some were triangular and unfamiliar to me.  Some made airplane noises, some were silent.  I took out my cell phone to record footage but the quality is much too poor. I put my phone away and decided to watch for a bit.  Some of the flying objects seemed to be flying in harmony—it almost looked like they were communicating.  All the vehicles were flying at different heights.I looked at one of the triangles, one closes to the ground, and I thought to myself, “Come closer,” and almost instantly the vehicle came closer, hovered above me and my car and then flew off.  Its lights were off and it felt like I was being watched.  I cannot say how far off the ground it was.My highest count at any given moment was 14 flying objects—some airplanes, some unknown.I got back into my car and drove into South Elgin, Illinois.  I stopped at a store on Randall Road.  When I exited my car in the parking lot, I checked out the sky and noted only 4 flying vehicles.

3257,"Thanksgiving UFO over Cranford, NJAt 8:00PM, Thanksgiving evening, I was sitting on my second story deck in Cranford, NJ, stargazing, when I observed a strange, orange light in the sky off to my right.  I watched the light for a few seconds to see if it had other lights on it and if it was possibly a plane (as I am in the flight path for Newark Airport), but it did not and was not…I grabbed my binoculars, and through them observed a bright orange sphere, flying due east, at the same altitude that small aircraft fly to get to Newark Airport (North West of my location), but it wasn't going toward the airport.  The orb did not pulse or strobe, and it seemed to be a brighter white light in the center, with the warm orange light surrounding it.  I could not make out a definitive outline for the object, and there were no discernable features from my perspective.  I watched it in my binoculars as it flew impossibly slowly and level for about 45 seconds or so, and when it reached a point in the sky whe! n it was exactly in front of me I said to it, 'Where the hell are you going?"", and at that moment it flickered brightly and just disappeared!  There were no clouds for it to disappear behind, and the moon was large, bright, and full to my left.  The reason this object initially caught my eye was because it was the same orange color of another UFO that I saw flying over my yard on July 4th of 2015 (which I will also file a report on, and should have back when I saw it!), although that one was a pulsing rectangle which was flying due South...This is the 3rd UFO that I have seen in my lifetime, and the 2nd one I have seen in the last 4 months!  I would be interested to know if anyone else in my area observed this orb. I would also be willing to speak to an investigator about my sightings.

3258,"Bright white light appeared at top of atmosphere then beamed straight down towards the earth in a split second.I may have reported this incident already a couple of days after the event occurred, but since it's been 2 years since the event, I forget if I had reported it here or elsewhere.  I'm reporting the sighting now even in the case I had reported it here 2 years ago, but forgotten that I had.  I tried to report my sighting to several sources but not sure what source was the 'correct' or reliable one.  What I had witnessed that day is still fresh in my mind, as if I had seen it just yesterday and I'm still baffled as to what it was (although I have kind of made up my mind that it was something other worldly).On my way driving home from a evening dinner with my wife, we stopped at an intersection at a red light with no cars in front of us (front of the line) with very possibly no cars behind us and little or no cars going through the intersection.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and dark (black sky).  Then, as if a light switch had flipped on and in the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright white light very high in the sky and off in the distance.  Then in an instant that light seemed to beam directly down towards the ground and did so very quickly and appeared to leave a trail of light as it moved to the ground.  As quickly as the light appeared it had moved towards the earth and disappeared out of sight.There was no sound that I had noticed with the light.  It definitely was not a meteor or something as the way it moved was as if it was 'warp' speed (light really high up in the atmosphere then beamed straight downwards in a straight line towards the ground).I had asked my wife if she had just seen that and she agreed that she did.  It was something that was completely unexpected and left us both in wonder at what we had just witnessed.  My mind immediately thought ufo or aliens but I did try to honestly think if it could of been a natural phenomena, but I couldn't think of anything natural that would match the description of what I had witnessed.",Duration:1 second,"Location: Edmonton (Canada), AB",Occurred : 11/26/2015 20:00  (Entered as : 11/26/15 20:00),Posted: 3/10/2017,Reported: 2/26/2017 8:15:25 PM 20:15,Shape: Light

3276,"Triangular object observed flying over lake.Around 9:00 PM, I went outside with my dog and decided to walk down a long staircase that leads to a small dock on a lake in Hide-A-Way Hills.  I notice a very bright light shining above the other side of the lake, above the trees.  This is a common occurrence because various airplanes fly over the area.  However, this light was considerably brighter.  At first I thought it might be another plane but it seemed to be taking longer to travel overhead.  In fact, I waited three minutes for the light to fly over the lake.  When it finally did, I noticed that there were no blinking lights, and that the bottom of the craft had small white lights at all three vertices, forming a triangle shape.  There was also a red light in the middle of the craft.The craft made no noise at all and seemed to be flying just above the tree tops. I’d say maybe 300-400 feet in the air.  Most airplanes that fly over are ate a much higher elevation.  As the craft passed by my left side, I made sure to wait for any sounds of a typical airplane, but I just couldn’t hear anything at all.  It’s a very, very still night with a bright full moon.The whole time I was observing the craft looking South.  The craft was traveling North and eventually passed my left side above the tree tops and disappeared over the hill.I should also note that I had just finished watching a comedy prior to going outside.  As soon as I rounded the corner of the house to descend the staircase, the light emerged over the top of the trees on the other side of the lake.  It felt oddly coincidental.

I yelled OMG, it's a space ship, just as it was passing my daughter walked out of the house to check on me for sitting in my car this late, and I said again, while pointing up, ""look it's a spaceship could you see it"" she looked up and was only able to see the weird light but heard the sound of something heavy/large passing by.The lights were in the clear of the sky but the object was surrounded by either clouds, moister, or smoke and the only way to get the full view of it was to be directly beneath it.Please know, I'm not one who's quick to believe something like this, as a matter of fact, I over look people who talk of UFO sighting, but last night/early morning made me a believer.  I witness the huge saucer object with lights located directly underneath the center part of this craft.

We got a couple of good looks at it right then, though we still weren't certain if it was moving or not.  It was not a plane, there were other planes in the sky with their white and red flashing lights but this orange fireball was definitely not a plane.  It wasn't the right color, it was way too big, too orange, too low to the ground, and it didn't seem to be moving towards any particular direction or in a path.But that's not even the weird part.  We kept driving and joked that it looked like a giant meteor that was headed strait for our town.  I started to drive in a North-west direction, towards what we saw, out of pure curiousity.  Maybe 20 minutes later we were near the highway and we saw the light again.  Bigger and brighter than before it shined through the trees.  As we drove foward and the trees disappeared to make room for the highway exit, two more bright orange lights appeared next to it.  Now, there were three of these lights in a row, similar to orions belt, two of them in line with each other and the other slightly off-center.  The two on the ends were not as bright as the one in the middle which looked slightly bigger than the others.  I really couldn't tell how far away the lights actually were because they were so bright.  All three of us saw the same thing.

3323,"Multiple UFO craft, abnormal turns and accelerations and appearing from nothing and then vanishing10-23-2015 Colorado Springs, Colorado, (Security area) UFO sighting.  Just after 4:00pm Just saw a UFO from my front yard in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as I was facing towards the South/South-East.  The flying objects were located almost straight up, thousands of feet up. (25? More?  By the time the encounter was over I had observed 4 different flying objects with the 1st morphing through three very different shapes during the encounter.  (Cigar, circle, then bell- Final shape when it disappeared between flickers)  When I noticed the first object, it caught my eye by being so white and shiny there amongst the blue backdrop of the sky with a only few high altitude clouds not far off from the fast steady moving cigar shaped craft.  It was the shape of a plane fuselage without wings and moving at high speeds across the sky with no vapor trail.  I could discern no details at this moment save the shape (cigar) and a flickering color.I watched if for a minute, it was way up there past the highest clouds, small to the naked eye. A single whitish craft with slight silvery sheen around an object that’s mostly white looking although there is setting sun colored (pinky orange) flashes towards the bottom side facing the sun.(The setting sun I believe is what gave it the appearance of flickering or flashing on that side no matter what direction the craft was traveling.  It may be reflection of the setting sun upon areas of the craft as the craft spins)  (It could almost be mistaken for a plane if it were holding a steady altitude and going a normal aircraft speed which at first it was, as if mimicking a normal aircraft in speed and altitude)  So in all the cigar shaped object seemed to be flickering a weird metallic white hue about most of the craft with pink/orange flashes radiating from the bottom-front sun facing side as it moved or darted about what seems like a long ways away almost straight above my house.This thing started moving like no aircraft known to civilian science as the motions defied my minds visual knowledge of physics in action.  Everything in me screamed this motion was unnatural for machines of man.  Every cell in the core of my being knew that what I saw was not possible within my now shattered understanding of the laws of motion.This movement and motion has only been hinted at in sci-fi movies and I must say that the movements of these objects were very different than even ‘that’.  How could something survive the forces, I could only guess, were in playing upon those craft and what about the effects upon any posible biological entity.This motion from the flickering shimmering glittery pink-tinted spheres were doing some short-range fast acceleration/deceleration maneuvers, zipping and pausing and darting around almost like the motion was governed by something my mind has no concept for comparison.  Their motion was different than anything I even seen in the movies, which is what gave me such a sick odd feeling in the pit of my soul.  (I have never experienced a sensation like that, which I felt while watching these objects. Knowing I was not alone in what I saw made me feel more ‘real’ than I ever have.)  The UFO started out as one cigar shaped object flying in a straight line at very high velocity before coming to a fast stop and changing directions.  For a couple minutes it darted about instead of staying upon the course I saw it upon originally.The object moved fluidly with fast stops and starts almost like a darting hummingbird with very little curving to its flight path as you would expect from any plane or aircraft known to the US and any other nations of the world.Human craft would need to bank and arc around in a circle to change directions. This was ‘No’ plane. I have worked on many aircraft and ‘nothing’ that is not mentioned in science fiction comes close to this behavior.  These craft moved about like predatory birds dogfighting at speeds and direction changes that defy imagination. Just think of the unbelievable g-force conditions exerted.I went to the front door to call for others to come see the UFO’s. When the two other witnesses showed up I pointed up to it and noticed that it was now circular shaped and fading in and out of view while hovering and appearing to dart around in a tight area.I realized the craft I relocated, ‘This craft’ was no longer cigar shaped, but circular in appearance all darting and flickering about close to the same area I last saw the original cigar shaped craft.( Did it change or was it a different craft. When I opened the house door to get someone else to see the weird objects, I lost site of the original object).It seemed to be winking in and out and hoping from being in one place to being in another close by. My mind had a hard time believing that metal could be made to move like that. These were no known manmade objects and these flying objects were real and right there in front of us all.Then, as I am pointing at it and the others are saying how weird it was moving and with everyone looking after having located the UFO, within moments, 3 more small whitish flickering UFO objects also circular and the same size as the first, appeared out of nowhere almost on top of the first.To me, at first, the first craft I saw seemed to be winking in and out, but then I started seeing two and three winking at the same time until ‘4’ circular/sphere shaped flying objects seemed to appear into existence.(Listen to what I am SAYING. ‘They’, three new UFO’s, just appeared, right in front of our eyes. When I say appeared, I mean that the one object was there alone. ((At least there was nothing else of interest within my visual spectrum although the jet had taken off climbing in a lazy mechanical manner flying a southerly direction with these UFO craft almost directly overhead)) It was just there alone one second and then the next second, three others start showing up, flickering in and out of visual sight.   There was no interception from the ground. I absolutely can tell you there was no craft on approach from earth. (One plane did take off from the base heading southeasterly direction with nothing in common as to shape or mannerisms. When I would glance at the plane I couldn’t help but keep thinking that, ‘THAT’ was how I was taught metal was supposed to act while in flight) Now there are 4 moving around the first with 2 hovering a lot within the first ones flight path while the 3rd seemed to be chasing the first. The original would zip one direction and the 2 would move as if to block and the first one would get close and stop very abruptly, a few times they got so close they were hard to make out as 2 separate objects.The 3 new arrivals appeared to be the same size as the first. The only explanation I can think of is that they came from out of the atmosphere at unbelievable speeds from way higher up than the original UFO.This seems a lame view of what happened, as we were watching the first one, the others just showed up blinking in and out of existence before solidifying for the rest of the encounter until they vanished for good. CLOAKING? When I say they just appeared I mean they (the 3 new comers) weren’t smaller looking than the 1st craft and on an intercept course until they got close enough to see them as being the same shape and size.‘No’, these things just appeared from out of ‘nothing’. There was one, and then there were 4 with 3 flickering in and out of existence for a few seconds longer than the first before they stabilized and remained in sight.These newest three craft just showed up like they were winking in and out existence or our visual spectrum for a few seconds (like flickering fast) and then they were all within our full view. Then the block and chase maneuver started from the three newcomers.I look at the plane that took off and marveled at how the motions of the plane and the motions of the UFO’s were so very in contrast with each other. Then I realized how unique my sighting was. I actually have a visual reference of one of humanity’s flying machines in flight in the same area as four unknown flying objects that defy conventional motion and shattered what I took to be reality of the limits of motion and metal. I saw these objects. I saw how they were moving and seeing ‘is’ believing.‘I now know, ‘that’ kind of motion is possible, for I saw it and believe it to be as true as the flight of the contrasting plane. They were both there and they were both real and vastly different.I know now first hand of the limitations to our own reality and the hardwired from birth ‘limits’ set in place within our own minds. Limits upon our beliefs and what we KNOW (were taught) to be true, on what we think is the entire scope of reality, machinery, physics and motion. Wake up ‘Please’. These limits themselves have limits and are not permanent. We can wake up our misguided views of the world. I have been shown a true taste of what’s possible. I know it’s possible because I saw it with my own eyes. In full focused contrast against an American aircraft in flight.I liken the feeling to showing a cell phone to an old west cowboy in the early 1800’s and showing that it works and that its real and there in front of him and that this tech is possible. I feel like that cowboy.Here are my comments on the aircraft: An aircraft took off around 4:15 give or take. When sight was lost on the original and only remaining UFO I went inside to check the time and it was 4:25GMT. The UFO on last location was almost straight over the house behind me now as I am facing between Cheyanne Mt. and Pikes Peak Mt. in Colorado Springs Colorado. The US Aircraft was heading south easterly where the flight paths would cross the original encounter location albeit at a far lower altitude.The plane was in no danger of collision as the UFO’s altitude was far greater and they(the UFO’s) were in and out of the clouds during their chase. Not in and out really just behind and peeking out from around as the cloud passed by. Visibility was excellent with very light cloud groups, very small very high up.As the Plane got further and further away the UFO objects still looked far away and above the plane’s flight path.The UFO objects appeared to be staying the same size as the aircraft receded from sight and it gave me a weird kind of dual reference point from my perspective of looking at both types of craft within the same field of vision, almost straight up from my front steps facing a southeasterly direction.Then I went to get the binoculars out of the van and it was really hard to find the targets. As I was looking for them in the binoculars, the three pursuit craft just winked out first one then the other two at about the same time.The original UFO that used to be a cigar shape, when I looked at it through the binoculars, I could see a definite bell shape, that for a few seconds I thought it had flickering on and off lights. It wasn’t really flickering lights on and off, It appeared to be rotating/spinning very fast with these quick flashes of pinky white glinting at the bottom corner of the craft that was facing the setting sun.The rotation was defined by a massive black form that interrupted the whiteness as it rotated. I just saw black splotch interrupting the whiteness with a much faster sunset color flickering or maybe flashing as if the sunlight was reflecting off of several objects upon the crafts side. It was a little hard to comprehend, but there were three flashes of sunset color in the bottom side that was facing the sun, per one black flash that never blacked out the overall whiteness of the object. This gave the definite appearance or rotational motion. Then with the craft in view through my binoculars, it vanished. Now try to comprehend what I am saying here. I mean, it disappeared between flickers. From one flicker to the next it just wasn’t there anymore. This was the last I saw of the UFO’s.",Duration:15-20 minutes,"Location: Colorado Springs, CO",Occurred : 11/23/2015 16:00  (Entered as : 11/23/2015 16:00),Posted: 11/26/2015,Reported: 11/23/2015 10:46:03 PM 22:46,Shape: Other

3325,"Four fireballs with long tails of fire sighted in the eastern sky from Orange County, CA.I noticed the first fireball while driving east on Chapman ave in the city of Orange at around 06:15.  I watched it come in and out of sight for over thirty minutes as I rode to work with my friend in her car all the way to Santa Margerita.  The fireball was heading north/northeast and had a long tail of fire.  It was about 30 degrees high at first and gradually worked its way down to about 15 degrees high after about 35 to 40 minutes when it suddenly burned out fell straight towards the ground.  The fireball turned into a large ball of smoke before it fell, and the straight tail of fire was replaced by a serpentine smoke trail. We picked up another worker in Santa Margerita and headed towards El Toro shortly after 07:00.  I saw another fireball identical to the first and at about the same trajectory that I had last seen the first one disappear.  I thought it was the same fireball initially, and I puzzled over how it could burn out, turn to smoke, and fall from the sky only to reappear ten minutes later.  I watched this second fireball flying in the sky for about five minutes before I lost sight of it behind the hills.  I sighted Two more fireballs within a minute of losing sight of the second.  Judging by the size of the fireballs and the length of the tails, these last two fireballs were much further away than the first two and lower in the sky, but they were all heading in the same direction. I could see what looked like a bright white light with a concave shape in front of and separate from the fire tail following directly behind it a few times and only when it appeared to be heading towards me.  It looked like a shield or something that was suspended directly in front of and well forward of a craft to protect it from burning up as it entered the atmosphere from outer space.  It was most often heading away from me, though, and it looked like a ball of fire with a burning tail.  I thought they were meteors at first, but I found out that meteors are hard to see in the daylight and usually burn out within 30 seconds when I looked to see if any one reported seeing any meteors at that time.

While I was taking a break from shovelling/snow-blowing, I noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving east/southeast almost directly toward me. It then changed its direction slightly (change of direction was just before it passed me) by moving due east. I watched it until I could no longer see it as it got behind some trees, etc.  I did notice it would change to a reddish tint a few times, but was a very bright orange the majority of time.  It was very illuminated.  I consider it was a solid circle/oval object (fully illuminated circle). I specifically looked for blinking lights or lights that would appear from an airplane, but none were there.  I was quite surprised by the solid brightness of the object throughout the duration.  As I focused while it passed me; the light appeared as a star image.  The object made noise as if it was an airplane, but it certainly w! as not an airplane using normal lighting sequences.  I’ve watched plenty of airplanes and the way it was moving just didn’t seem to match the way an airplane moves (I’d be shocked if it were an airplane).  The altitude was approximately around or below 8,000 feet (this could be a very inaccurate judgment).  However, I just recall it seeming to be very close/low in the sky.  I'm always looking up at the sky when I have a chance, and this isn't the first time I've seen something. It was not a lantern because the altitude did not change while it moved by me.

It did not look like airplane lights since no other colors appeared, just extremely pure brilliant red.One seemed to be heading upward and getting closer and the other appeared to be heading downward and getting closer, coming toward my direction in other words and they had a roundish appearance to them.I did not think to take out my cell phone and try taking photos, they might not come out since it's not really a good camera for in the dark anyhow.As I watched, soon the lights came near to one another, maybe touched, but I could not know for sure.  Then one shot outwards to the left and going higher and disappeared out of sight, in the matter of a few seconds.Then the other shot up and outward, at an angle heading exactly back in the opposite direction while going up - and it seemed to accelerate as it got smaller and smaller, then disappeared in a few seconds also, like it had traveled out of sight in a very short time.There was no noises from these lights, but I doubted there would be given how far away and high they appeared.  The only noises were sounds in the parking lot and long the main road of cars driving by or peoples' voices in the background going in and out of the stores.That is all I know and can report on what I saw tonight here in North Auburn, CA, 95603.I am 61 years old, male, non-drinker, non-smoker, non-drug user, of clear mind and body, do not suffer from haulucinations or anything of the sort.  So I am certain I saw what I saw with my own two eyes and have reported what I saw as accurately as I can remember.It is now 1 hour and 20 minutes after seeing what I saw.

3373,"Orange orb seen from plane flying over northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon Nov. 21, 2015ORANGE BALL OR ORB  On Saturday evening, October 21st, 2015, I was flying from Albuquerque to Seattle.  We left Albuquerque at 4.35 Mountain time, arriving in Seattle at 6.45 Pacific time.Somewhere north of Salt Lake City, looking at the flight path it could have been northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon – I really am not that familiar with the area, I looked out of the window on the left side of the plane, looking to the west.  We were flying, I think, at 36,000 feet.  The mountains were some way below us.  It was dark by that time, but I could see towns and communities lit up and I think there was some light from the moon.  Generally the sky was clear.I suddenly noticed a large, orange ball approaching from the north or north-west, below the plane, travelling very fast to the south or south-east.  It was very steady – glowing with light – lit from within – a bit like a huge ball of fuzzy orange felt!  It soon went behind the engine of the plane – I was sitting near the front.  I can’t begin to assess how big it was – it was far below our plane – I had the impression it was very big.  Many of the pictures I have seen on the Internet show the exact colour – a true orange – and shape and look.I remember there were some mountains overshadowing a small town.  The object was travelling below the tip of the mountains, around the tree line.  The trajectory was unwavering – no other lights to indicate it was a plane or helicopter.  It seemed to me to be travelling way too fast to be a plane.I don’t think I have any more to add.  I didn’t have anyone beside me to verify and it all happened so quickly.  I wonder if you have any more reports from passengers on the plane.

3402,Saw a series of 4 horizontal orangish lights tracing each other in the sky for a few minutes before they disappeared.I just got home from work and was walking our dog when I first noticed the 4 lights in a perfect horizontal formation.  The 4 orangeish lights were spaced apart perfectly.  The lights were tracing each other.  Meaning the first light on the left would come on then go off and the second would come on and so on until it got to the last light and the pattern would start again.  It did this tracing for about 2 minutes.  After those 2 minutes it went to only a single light that would pulse on and off (I was able to capture this on my phone). This only lasted maybe a minute.  Then it was completely gone. No more lights to be seen. The lights appeared to be less than 5 miles away and there weren't any audible noises you would expect a flying craft to make.,Duration:<5 minutes,"Location: west union, OH",Occurred : 11/20/2015 18:22  (Entered as : 11/20/15 18:22),Posted: 11/26/2015,Reported: 11/21/2015 7:20:38 AM 07:20,Shape: Formation

Our car headlights may have caused the haze effect.

We took pictures at the exact same time as marked by the date and time on our phones, but her photo does not capture the UFO.  I actually have two pictures taken at the same hour:minute.  One is a little more blurry because a car was driving in the distance, but, both of my photo's capture the unidentified object pretty clearly.Personally, I've never been one to believe in UFO's, though, I believe there is most definitely ""life"" outside of Earth.

3459,"Orbs of light behind clouds circling around eachother.THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A POST SUBMITTED AT APPROX. 19:30 ET. by myself. ***update*** After seeing the objects described below I had to return to my studies inside. Approximately 2 hours later at roughly 9:15 PM the objects were still there in the sky. The only notable changes was that the area they were moving across had expanded substantially and that the sky was generally brighter in their vicinity. I also wanted to note the lights are BLUE in color - not the typical orange or red that is often reported with orbs of light. I have notified a few friends who are seeing the same thing but all are in the local vicinity.  We are all college students and seeing as it is a Tuesday night, no substances are in our bodies. We all agree that the phenomenon is almost mesmerizing. This is 100% genuine. I have a picture of the orbs from a smartphone that I will email to ufocntr@nwlink.com. *prior post: Looking east, above the cloud layer were two - but at times three - orbs of light. They were about 45 degrees above the horizon and stayed within a small area in the sky. The lights looked large but may have been enlarged due to the glare on the clouds.

3480,"We saw 11 bright orange lights moving slowly from left to right in formation totally unlike anything explainable.I experienced a very unusual observation in the night of November 16, around 1930 hours EDT, in an area about 45 miles northwest of Philadelphia near Pottstown, PA.  The sighting took place while I was driving with my wife on Harmonyville Rd., North Coventry Township, Chester County Pennsylvania.  The exact coordinates of the location are:  N40.18741 degrees W75.74.242 degrees   The sighting involved at least 11 bright orange lights moving slowly together, generally in a northwest to southeast direction, and lasted in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 minutes.  I think there were a few more lights than 11, but I was counting as fast as I could because I did not know how much longer the lights would be visible and I wanted to be sure to get a rough count, at least, before they disappeared.The lights were all a bright orange, equal in color and brightness. They appeared to be randomly arranged, with no apparent rhyme or reason in their relationships to one another.  They appeared to be more than a pin point of light as you see when looking at a star or planet with the naked eye.  They appeared to have an actual dimension to them using just my unaided eye.The lights were all moving in unison in a northwest to southeast direction.  They all moved at the same speed and did not change at all in their relationship to one another, as though they were physically connected.  Nothing could be observed, however, connecting one light to another. It was the appearance an object would have if the orange lights were coming out of windows in an object that had windows but was otherwise invisible.  But that isn’t is it?  They were moving very slowly from left to right. When I first spotted them, they appeared to be stationary, but after I stopped the car to get out and look closely I noticed they were in fact moving at a steady slow speed.  They had an observable speed such as you would see when looking at a high flying jet aircraft or man made satellite passing over head.The lights I saw were about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon at the lowest and about 20 degrees at the highest.  They appeared to be fairly close to me and absolutely were not stars, planets, man made satellites, flying aircraft or like anything else I have ever seen.The light farthest to the left, from where I stood, was on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees and the light on the right was on a heading of 125 degrees, so they covered an arc in the sky of about 25 degrees.  As mentioned above, the vertical development was only an arc of about 10 to 15 degrees, so the lights collectively were a good bit wider than they were high.As we watched, the lights farthest to the right started to go dim and then became invisible as though they were either going into or behind a cloud or fog bank.  We could not detect either, so I can not tell if they were going out or being obscured. Then, as the remaining lights approached the same area of the sky, they also slowly dimmed and disappeared.There was no sound whatsoever connected to the sighting, I was in a remote rural area and there was no other vehicular traffic or local noises, so it was a very quiet setting.I am a retired attorney with a rudimentary knowledge of astronomy, a private pilot’s license and in all my life I have never come even close to seeing anything even remotely like what I saw last night. My wife was with me and saw the exact same thing.I have simply no clue at all concerning what we saw, but, I am totally certain we saw exactly what I described above.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))11-20-201516:25 hours ESTDear Peter,I just submitted to you a UFO sighting report and want to follow up that report with the two attached photos which I downloaded from the internet to show better what my wife and I saw 11-16-2015.The pic with ""163"" in the name of the .jpg, shows what the random assembly of lights looked like to us.

3485,"Shiney chevron shaped object traveling East over Lake Niagara, and then changed direction going South.I was in my front yard facing North across Lake Ontario when I heard a helicopter approach from the East. I watched the small, white, news type helicopter then noticed a shiny object higher than the helicopter.  The helicopter went past and didn't hesitate at all. (they often travel this path).  The shiny object seemed to be pretty stationary and not moving. I went into the house and came back out with a small pair of binoculars but I still could not determine exact shape of object.  It was longish with something hanging below it so I thought it might be a big weather balloon.  I have never seen a weather balloon.  The object was very shiny and reflected the sun which was bright.  The sun was over my left shoulder.  The object began to move to the right, Eastward.  It moved fairly slowly and almost seemed to be tumbling or changing shape.  I really thought it was a balloon and tried to get some pictures with my cell phone.  I got a few.  The object was very far above the trees. I noticed a commercial airline going toward the East far above the object and not anywhere near it. The object was so high in the sky that it was impossible to make out its shape but it had to be pretty large because I wouldn't have been able to see it otherwise.  Much larger than a party balloon.  I walked into the field about 30 yards to my East to watch the object moving towards the East but after about 1/2 mile it changed direction and moved West and towards me.  It then moved more Southwest slowly.  I stood in the plowed field and watched it and it moved until it was overhead and to the South.  It was close enough that I could make out the shape then which was an L or V shape.  It resembled a very large L like that from a metal sign. It had no lights, made no sound but had square corners.  I would take a guess and say it was much bigger than me at least 10 feet or so. It traveled into the direction of the sun and I could no longer see it.  About 20 minutes from when I first saw it.

3503,"Neon white craft in the southern Sierra Mountain range.Let me start this by saying that I have had a lifelong interest in the ufo subject.  I am 29 years old and was born and raised in Bakersfield, CA.  Despite this, I have never seen anything that I could not explain in the sky.  I believe that changed on Sunday, November 15, 2015.I was driving home on Rancheria rd. which lies about 10-15 miles east of Bakersfield. Rancheria runs north and south and will take you from east Bakersfield all the way up to the Alta Sierra area.This particular day was a very rare and stormy day for this area. There was rain, snow and tiny hail coming down all day.  I am a 4x4 enthusiast and was going up a trail called ""Freeway Ridge"" with a small group of friends.  This trail starts at hwy. 178 and ends at Evans flat campground and traverses through the southern sierras.  After a long and muddy day of 4 wheeling we finally reached the end of the trail.  Rancheria road is the quickest way back to Bakersfield.  Rancheria is winding road that is very dangerous, especially when wet. We were going south at an average of about 15 mph.  It is 25 miles back to Bakersfield as the crow flies but it takes at least an hour to drive on any given day.  Visibility was very low because of rain, fog, and mud covered vehicles.  This day it took us about 1.5 hrs to travel this 25 mile road.  Now on to my sighting.  About 15 miles south of Evan's Flat campground, I see a light coming down towards the mountain.  It looked like a small plane at first and was approx. 4-500 yards to my left.  I am a golfer, so I feel like I am a good judge of yardage.  I almost panicked at first because it looked like this small plane was going to crash into the mountain to my left.  It was very low to the tree line.  As I focused in on this light (difficult with mud covered windows/windshield) I could see that it was not a plane of any kind.  I got a clear look at it for about 3-4 seconds.  It was 2 bright neon white round balls with a thin neon white line connecting them.  It did not produce any halo of light behind it.  It was traveling on a horizontal plane and coming down diagonally towards the ground.  Its flight is why I originally thought a plane was going to crash.  After the 3-4 seconds, I could see it fly behind some trees, and then it disappeared.  Let me also mention that this was 15 min. after sunset with complete cloud cover and rain.  It was basically dark outside.While this whole experience was seemingly mundane it was also very spectacular to me.  I couldn't begin to come up with a logical explanation of what this thing could have been.  It gave me the chills and made the hair on my body stand on end. I apologize for the wordy post but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.  Strange things are definitely out there.

3504,"Jello mold shaped UFO.On November 15, 2015, at approximately 13:00 hours, I observed what appeared to be a point of fairly bright light in the southern sky.  This point of light was several degrees south of zenith, and slightly east.  Weather conditions at the time were clear, sunny, and fairly warm.  The light was similar in brightness to Saturn.  I observed the light with the naked eye for approximately three minutes.  The light did not move, flicker, dim, or increase in brightness.  I went indoors and obtained a pair of binoculars.Upon returning outside, I used my binoculars to look at the object.  It resolved in the field of view of my binoculars as a disc shaped object.  The object was not moving, nor were there any lights or other activity around the object.  It appeared to be chrome or light grey in color and at a fairly high altitude.  The material was very reflective.  I observed the object for about five minutes.  Unable to determine what the object was, I then went back indoors and brought out my Orion 4.5’ Equatorial Reflector Telescope with a 25mm optic.I found the object in my telescope and was able to notice greater detail about the object.  It was circular, and appeared to have thick, ribbed sides, similar to a Jello mold in appearance.  In the center of the object was a small nodule, also circular, that could best be described as the top of a bell.  There did not appear to be any tethering equipment attached to this object, nor any lights, windows, doors, or instrumentation attached, nor any motion from the object.  It remained stationary the entire time I observed it, which was about twenty-five minutes.  The object also appeared to be very stable and did not appear to be moving as a result of any winds that may be at the altitude the object was at.After resuming my outdoor activities, I came back to look for the object just before 15:00 hours.  The object was gone. I could not locate it anywhere else in the sky using my naked eye or my binoculars.

I know that there isn't an airport near Burns Park in Massapequa and the 2 that crossed look like they came from that area.,Duration:5 minutes,"Location: Massapequa, NY",Occurred : 11/14/2015 23:00  (Entered as : 11/14/15 23:00),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/14/2015 8:58:51 PM 20:58,Shape: Circle
3514,Continuous &quot;flashing&quot; light in space...I am seeing a strobing light high in the night sky.  It is just “up” from the star “Sasin”.  It looks like a star that flashes on and then off again (but I am sure it is not a star).  A geosynchronous satellite perhaps?  The flash of light appears approximately every 10 seconds and is sometimes brighter and it is sometimes very hard to see. It has remained stationary for at least 30 minutes.,Duration:ongoing,"Location: Kaunakakai, HI",Occurred : 11/14/2015 22:45  (Entered as : 11/14/16 22:45),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/15/2015 1:27:41 AM 01:27,Shape: Other

3519,"Seemingly undetectable triangle craft detected briefly over Carroll, Iowa.((NUFORC Note:  Report was originally posted for November 15, 2015.  However, Saturday night was November 14, and we have amended the date.  The correction will appear at our next update.  We apologize for the error!  PD))Saturday night, November 15th, 2015, 19:40 pm - Carroll, IA.  I was standing outside in a residential neighborhood close to the business district on crisp fall night facing east.  I caught a glimpse of something in the sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon through some power/phone lines and over the buildings a block away.  The sky was pitch black, but only a few stars visible due to the city light pollution.A very clear night regardless, no overcast or clouds to speak of.  I've never seen anything like this in the sky before, and my eyes don't lie. I have always had perfect 20/20 vision my entire life, I do a lot of hunting and feel like my keen sense of sight has always been one of my greatest attributes in the field.  Being able to detect the slightest movement in any environment, sometimes distant has never been something I've struggled with.I spotted something, quickly in 1/2 a second my eye keened in on the movement.  At first I thought it was just a plane.  In the next moment I knew this wasn't a plane, or commercial airline.  I can't rule out that it might have been some military or government aircraft, but if it was, it was pretty damn impressive; top secret stealth kind of impressive.  The sky was so dark all around the object.  And the object didn't have any lights, not as most every other plane or jet I've seen in the skies.Clearly it was the shape of a triangle, at least the leading two edges were, which came to a point and pointed in the direction of flight.  It headed on a path from north to south as I watched in the eastern sky over town.  Carroll is appx. 10,000 in population, not a huge town, but pretty well lit at night.  I was standing in the central part of town, and would say that craft had to have been flying just over the eastern out skirts of town, maybe 3-4 miles away and low flying.  I'm not sure exactly but I'd have to say it was flying somewhere around 1,000 to 2,000 feet, it looked close.The object was black, matching the night sky.  It was meant to be undetectable, like a stealth spy plane, I guess.  But it looked completely out of place, flying low over small town Iowa like that, and cruising along silently.  The color of the object matched the background sky, but because of my location relative to the object and the city lights below, I could see the slightest reflection from town on the bottom side of the craft.  It was big, but again very difficult to estimate it's size, possibly B-2 Bomber size, possibly bigger.  All I could see was what appeared to be a slight reflection of city light on the leading edges of this triangle shape, gliding through the sky, effortlessly, and without a sound that I could hear.If I were to illustrate the sighting, it would be a black page with the slightest bit of light visible on the leading edges of the triangle.  There was no tail to the object, at least not that I could see the difference between it and the night sky.As I watched through that first two seconds I thought, I need to grab someone inside to witness this with me.  And before I could even put my hand on the door handle, to call for someone, it abruptly vanished with a fade to black. I kept tracking it anyway, hoping I'd get another look at it, but did not. This all happened in around 4 seconds time.  I kept my eyes on it for those brief few seconds until it vanished.I reported this because it shook me up when I saw it.  If it is one of our top secret planes, I can't imagine why it would be flying around there and especially that low.  I was lucky enough to catch the light of the city on the bottom of it as it passed by town for about 4 seconds. Whoever's plane or craft it is, they don't want anyone to see it, and it did an amazing job and being undetectable.  I'm not positive, but I'd imagine I could have heard a jet or plane from that range pretty easily even through the white noise of the town, but I didn't.  And that is what makes me wonder what exactly that was.By reporting this I also hope to learn if anyone else saw this in Carroll that night as well. It would be great for one story to back another, and to know that I wasn't the only one who saw this strange sight.",Duration:4 seconds,"Location: Carroll, IA",Occurred : 11/14/2015 19:40  (Entered as : 11/15/15 19:40),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/14/2015 11:53:54 PM 23:53,Shape: Triangle

3524,"An aircraft stopped above our town in the dark, shining a bright light on the town, and sprayed something down upon us.On a Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, I went to get water at an outdoor water vending machine.  As I was pulling up to it, I saw what I thought was the largest spotlight I have ever seen, shining its bright light down upon the fairly small town of Rosamond, which is approximately 80 miles north of Los Angeles.  I got out of my car, thinking at first that it was a helicopter.  I realized it was much too high in the sky for that.  I could not see what the object was because of the enormous light coming down from it, which lit up a large portion of the town.  Suddenly something liquid, visible in the light, began spraying down from the object.  The fluid descended quite rapidly, spreading as it fell down.  I quickly called my mom’s number so she might see the sight.  No answer. The huge light turned off and the object was gone, but I could still see the (glowing?) mist approaching in the dark.  Above, I could see a bluish/green glow left in the sky where the mist had fallen from.  I then called my sister who lived about 6 miles outside of town because I knew she and her husband sat outside each night.  She had also seen the bright light and remnants of the bluish/green glow…but had not seen the spray fall upon the town.  I learned the next day the armed forces said they had shot a missile which had flown over the L.A. area and near our town.  But if it was a missile, why did it stop over our town to spray us with something?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then noticed that there were two soft glowing lights, one on each end of a rectangular shape.  The shape had a slight curve toward the middle of both the front and back.  It was traveling North to South.It also seemed to have a swirling bluish green glow moving in a random pattern all over the shape.I have viewed many satellites, the ISS and aircraft of all kinds. I have never seen anything moving this quickly across the sky.  I would guess on average, a satellite would take 45 seconds to a minute to cross through my vision of sight.

3557,"Two oval objects, 10-15ft long, seen above road during drive home at night.Date and Time:  November 12, 2015.  Some time between 11:30pm and 12:15am at night.Location:  Texas, Brown County.  Three separate locations on Hwy 183.  I was driving.	First appearance:  At roughly the following coordinates, 31.8792102,-98.918499 	Second appearance:  I was still startled by what I had seen so I wasn't really paying attention to exactly where I was.  But it was somewhere between the coordinates listed above and the coordinates of the third appearance.	Third appearance:  At roughly the following coordinates, 31.9639032,-98.920559 	What I saw:  Two objects, possibly one, above the road.  One long, oval shaped object with a shorter oval shaped object directly below it.  The reason I say 'possibly one' object is because each time I saw it, it was identical in shape (though not in size) to the time before.  Which leads me to consider the possiblity that what I saw was a singular object with two oval shapes or projections that may have simply been more obvious than the remainder of the object which I may not have been able to see.	On the first appearance, the object about 20 feet away from me.  It was directly above the road.  From the top of the larger oval shape, to the bottom of the smaller oval shape it was possibly 10 feet long.  It was stationary as I drove directly under it.  If I had got out of the car and approached it I might have been able to just reach the bottom of it and touch it.  However, when I turned back to see what it was, the object(s) had gone.  The first time I saw it, the object(s) was not particularly bright.  That is, it did not seem to shine its own light, but was well illuminated by my headlights.  There was another car behind me who had to have seen it as well.	Oddly, I hardly remember the second appearance.  I only remember that I saw it and it looked was smaller.  As I sit here writing this, I'm trying to remember, but I just can't.	On the third appearance the object(s) was to my left, about 5 feet from the ground and about 10 feet away.  This time it seemed about 15 feet tall from top to bottom and seemed to be brightly illuminated from within.  I went back to try to get a better look, but again, the object(s) had gone.  During this drive I was traveling at about 55mph.  When I turned off of Hwy 183 onto the road that leads to my house, I drove at about 30mph, hoping that I would see the object again and be able to stop before I passed it, but the object(s) did not reappear.

I noticed one of my son's point out to his twin  brother something in the sky just northwest of our location.  I also heard him ask, ""Do you see that?"".  I did not have the chance to look in the sky.  A few minutes later my son asked me, ""Mom, has man invented a flying craft that can just hover in one spot and stay there for a little while, than just leave?"".  He and his brother explained to me that they saw what appeared to be an oval shaped, dark 'thing' in the sky, just hover, than slowly fly further northwest.  They said it did not fly fast, but rather the speed an airplane in the sky appears to fly, at lower altitudes.  It was not too close to the tree tops, but much further up.  They described it as small, dark, oval shaped, with two orange flashing lights on its side, hovering and spinning.  They said they knew it was was! spinning  because they could see the sun's reflection light up different parts of the object, like windows would on a spinning object.  There was no obvious sound coming from it. I immediately thought a drone, but I honestly did not spend too much time online to make this determination.  We live in a rural area where the general population would not really have drones, and honestly, I don't think I've ever seen a drone around here, thank goodness.  So, I'm stumped.

3591,"Four dim lights move in formation across the sky, with no blinking, color, or soundI was taking my dog out after getting in late from work.  I'm a grad student at the University of Georgia in a physical science.  I was looking at Orion and noticed 4 dim lights moving across the sky above Orion's head.  The lights were dim (about as bright as the stars in Orion's sword or bow) but arranged like an equilateral triangle pointed in the direction of movement and the fourth light was on the left back side (if you extended the left triangle side back along the angle of the triangle's side).  All lights were pretty equally spaced (except the fourth light from the far triangle's other vertex).  No odd color or flashing seen.  No sound.  Overall size/spread comparable to the Pleiades.They moved pretty fast in a ~330 degree heading.  I tried to see if the shape would eclipse a star (to see if they were four lights on a single craft/plane) or if they were separated with nothing between the lights, but the lights didn't pass over any stars I could see.  I lost it in the city glare about 10-20 seconds after spotting the lights, when it had covered about 1/4 of the sky.It honestly looked very similar to a simple satellite crossing the sky, except there were four moving in motion together.  I didn't notice any obvious individual light movement or change in relative position between the lights, but I think I saw a slight change in the relative positions due to perspective change as it flew farther to the northwest. No way to estimate altitude, although it was large enough that if it was a plane, it would've been low enough to hear probably.If four satellites could be placed together and move together across the sky, that would look just like this.

The rope-like object was white but I could almost discern a slight black banding down the length of the object.  It slowly curled and twisted just as a worm would as the clouds (below the object) passed quickly, which ruled out the possibility of it being anything inflatable like a string of balloons etc.  The wind did not move the object!  About 2-3 minutes elapsed when the object suddenly began to fade and within 3 seconds, it vanished. After some research, i learned these sightings are called ""Sky Serpents"" and this was an exact stereotype. I discovered that they ! are very common and have have even shown up on some NASA footage.  I do wonder if the military gets were scrambled to intercept this object.  Their path was liner and didn't seem to engage, (basing on the sound as it tracked across the sky) but, the sound trail of the jets did pass in the immediate vicinity of this object.",Duration:3 minutes,"Location: Meridian, ID",Occurred : 11/10/2015 12:05  (Entered as : 11/10/2015 12:05),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/13/2015 8:20:03 PM 20:20,Shape: Other

3637,"Classified aircrafts with bright orange lights.These seem to be some type of military craft of unknown type.At 7:37 PM central time, my brother and I were walking on the north side of Edison elementary school when we noticed 3 very bright (as bright as Venus or ISS going overhead) red/orange lights to the south.  They were low in the southern sky and maybe 20 degrees above the horizon and heading due north when we spotted them.  The craft were widely spaced and were not in any type of obvious formation.  They were spaced miles apart and the middle one was in front of the others from our vantage point. The evening sky was clear with very good visibility.  Temp was 44F wind was SW at 9mph.  Stars were clearly visible.  The atmosphere was stable.As they move closer it became clear.  The lights were extremely bright.  Much, much brighter then B-52s at night.  Minot Air Force Base is 13 miles due north and home to 28 B-52Hs.  I've watched the bombers fly at night with all their lights on while doing pattern work.  These aircraft were not BUFFs.  To us, they were at an unknown altitude,  But, if I were to guess base on how soon the sound reached us as they passed overhead I would say about 10,000 feet.  There was a soft turbofan engine noise (almost like it was muffled).  The engine noise was distinctly different from a B-52.   They moved much slower than passenger jets overflying Minot at cruising altitude.  I'm guessing these vehicles were doing 200 knots.  The orange lights numbered a dozen or more on the bottom of the craft.  The pattern of the lights were spread out across the width of the wing or body and made it appear to have a very wide wing.  It also had one extremely bright search light that was also orange.  It was rather washed out or dull and was beaming its light ahead of the vehicle.

As it passed over, I saw how big it was, it was huge. Biggest plane I have ever seen.  But when it passed over all I could see was 3 lights.  I could not make out any other features, so I assumed it was a plane or triangular.  1 light in front with 1 light at 45 degrees behind the front light to either side of the front light.  It made no sound and was moving very slowly.  When it had passed over me, I could see it out the passenger window.  It looked as if it was going to crash into the city of Irondequoit.  The craft then started to ascend and I could make out features of the craft by its silhouette from the city lights.  What I saw was something I have never seen before. 3 identical cylindrical objects. 2 above 1 below.  The 2 above at a 45 degrees to either side of the 1 below.  Both connected by beams to the 1 below.  The lights were not ordinary, they looked like fire but not fire. I would guess that they were electro magnetic propulsion.  These cylinders were identical and reversed.  The 2 on top lights were in back and the 1 on the bottom was in front.

3681,"Fast Moving Triangle Craft - Two EventsAt about 9:15 pm on November 7, 2015, I decided to sit in my hot tub.  About an hour later I witnessed a silent black triangle fly over the tree in my backyard continuing over the neighbor's house - it was coming from the northeast and flying to the southeast.  I believe it was between 10:15 and 10:30 pm, I did not look at the time on my phone until 10:44 because I was collecting my thoughts on what I had just witnessed.  The object had flown over in the 11 o'clock position and was about the size of my fingers at arm's length or about 3 1/2 inches.  It was an equilateral triangle, silent, black with pointed  corners, and the two leading edges were glowing.  About 45 minutes later probably between 11:00 and 11:05 pm - (I didn't look at the time until 11:09 pm because once again I was collecting my thoughts.) I saw two of what I assumed were the same object that I saw earlier.  They were flying north to south in a side by side formation.  The two leading edges of both objects were glowing and this is what I was focused on.  I was trying to figure out how many ""lights"" there were.  The glow was very, very dim.  There were many points of light on the edge and brightness was not consistent nor was the spacing even.  Having experience working with plasma, it appeared to be more of a plasma glow.  By 11:15 pm I had decided that was enough of that for one night and I was in the house.This would be the first time that I have experienced anything of that nature.  It freaked me out to the point that I slept with the  lights on for about a week.  I had just set up the hot tub towards the end of summer and was spending one to six hours in it per night or about 20 to 30 hours a week.

Then ... it just stopped. A few seconds later it carried on toward the ferry terminal over Snug Cove.  Then another one appeared from the same direction, then another and another.  Over 15 minutes about 12 of the objects flew over my house or just off to the north.  It was unreal, when I realized the first one was not a plane on fire my paranoia kicked in and I immediately thought it was a missile.  I felt progressively worse after about 7 of these things because to me one is a sighting but 12 is an invasion or at-least a serious desire to demonstrate that they know your watching.  They definitely wanted! to be seen, low in the sky and all travelling from the same direction and flying toward West Vancouver like 12 balls of fire.

I commented to my wife, who was seated on the porch, that the skies had cleared up nicely when I noticed an object in the night sky which was moving at a good pace and blocking out stars as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  The object appeared as a dull grey mass against the night sky, and is of indeterminate shape due to the lack of light.  I would estimate the size of the object to be roughly the equivalent of holding a dime at arm's length, possibly smaller.  There were no lights visible on the object.  The only reason that I even saw it was because stars were being blocked out as it traveled.  There was no sound at all, and it was almost directly overhead, as opposed to being off at an angle to me.  I commented on it to my wife, but, she was not able to see it, as there is a streetlight directly across from our house, and she! was facing into the light, while I had my back to it.  Upon turning around to track its course, I, too, lost it in the light pollution from the streetlight and neighboring houses whose porch lights are on.  I would estimate that the total time that I saw it is around ten seconds, before turning and losing sight of it due to the lights at ground level. Not being able to estimate its altitude, it would be impossible to estimate its speed, however, it was moving along at a pretty good clip. We live within a couple of miles of Lake Michigan, and it is not uncommon for people to share stories of seeing strange things in the night sky in the area.

At first I figured it was a plane enroute for approach, especially since I am so close to an airport, but then after looking at the light for a bit, it seemed to be far too bright to be a landing light and not to mention the direction it was coming from is not a typical approach. I am a pilot and can verify this for certain.  So any way, the light lit up, and although the skies were clear, a bright light enclosed by a cone shaped ""canopy"" was displayed.  I have never seen anything like this before - it was almost beautiful.  I am not conspiracy theorist, but I do have a solid scientific type of background, and can honestly say I was blown away by this since I've never seen anything like it before! the best way to describe the light would be similar to a movie of when a suspect is being in! terrogated by detectives in a smoky room with only a table lamp.  The light emitting from the lamp is basically similar to what I saw on a larger scale.  I was so fascinated by it, I immediately called my wife and asked her to look outside.  She didn't see the lights on, however the strangest thing she did see is that the ""clouds"" or smoke I originally saw was somehow still radiating like a bluish color even after the light diminished for several minutes.  It almost appeared as if the moon was behind the clouds, but just on a very smaller scale.  Any way, I went back home and kept on looking at the sky about half an hour later to see if I would see something again, and the skies were as clear as water; no clouds smoke or anything.

A grey colored “cloud” formed around the light and expanded, much like a shock wave.

Over time the blue cloud began to dim and the white light appeared to have a vertical bluish shaft of light directed groundward.

3739,"bright light in the sky with corresponding dust/cloud on the groundWhile driving along Interstate 70 westbound out of Moab, UT, but not before Green River, I saw a light low in the sky, roughly 500-1000’ above the deck, with an apparent cloud or dust plume below the light around the ground.  The light was white/yellow in color.  It moved west for about 10 mins in the same direction I was travelling.  I never reached the cloud or dust plume along the highway before the light dissipated.My initial impression was that it was an aircraft from the Moab airport, but it seemed too low for a fixed wing aircraft.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter shining a light on the ground, and subsequently saw a Highway Patrol car in the median of the road (I’m certain that he would have been in a position to film this event as he was facing West).Having heard detailed reports of the events in CA on this night, I’m almost convinced that what I saw was related, though my distance from CA makes my think I was too far to actually see that.  I’m wondering if this was part of a missile shield launch from UT to intercept something in CA.I heard no noise from this event.  It was hard to see any details as the highway out there is very dark and there is little ambient light from the surroundings.",Duration:10 minutes,"Location: Moab, UT",Occurred : 11/7/2015 19:00  (Entered as : 11/07/2015 19:00),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/17/2015 10:14:01 AM 10:14,Shape: Unknown

3784,"Strange light and trajectory of spherical object seen offshore west of San Diego,1805 PT, 7 Nov 2015.((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))I just turned on to the street on which our house is located.  Maplewood St  Poway CA is a street that basically runs in a northeast to southwest direction  and intersects with twin peaks.  I was driving east on twin Peaks and turned right heading southwest on Maplewood.  I noted a object streaking in a south to north direction through the sky maybe 30 Deg above the horizon leaving a trail that appeared to be 6-12 inches long, as compared to 2-3 fist lengths at arms length.  The leading sphere was orange in color.  My initial thoughts were a meteor as the object was not really changing elevation.  As I was pulling into my driveway a time span from my first sighting, maybe 30 seconds the tail began to dissipate in length to no visible tail.  At this point I had gotten out of my vehicle and was walking up to the front door.  As I approached the door I yelled for my wife to come check it out as it was changing color from a burnt orange to white and had stopped ! tracking south to north and became stationary.  The sphere became extremely bright white and hovered at a constant location with minor oscillations.  This transition from moving object to stopped object changing color from orange to bright white was maybe 45 seconds.  At this point my wife came outside and I showed her the object.  The object then appeared to move in a westerly direction from stationary on a slightly upward trajectory but maybe only a 5 deg increase.  It appeared to be moving away and the sphere began to decrease in diameter.  There was a bright blue halo trailing the object which became oblong.  Over a period of another 45-90 seconds the object continued to receded from our position.  However the bluish contrail remained for a additional 5-30 seconds .For some background I am a mechanical engineer.  I worked at CCAFS in FL for a period of one year working for General Dynamics on the Atlas program.  I have witnessed more that 6 night launches of vehicle ranging from Delta, Titan, Atlas II & Atlas V and STS.  I have seen launches in dead night and near sunset and sunrise.The brilliant white light which trailed away from our view location was unlike any propulsion system glow I have ever witnessed.  The color and shape of the plume was unlike any chemical rocket plume. Additionally the brilliant white color was brighter and very consistent in color density.  Again unlike any view I have ever witnessed in the launch industry.What was out of place? 1. Transitioning from south to north travel at a constant horizon height to stopped.  Tail to no tail and change of color.2. Color of sphere or propulsion.3. Unlike any medium to large chemical rocket launch I have ever witnessed.No small missile launched off a military vessel displays this brilliant white propulsion system.  I have witnessed launches from VAFB of Atlas, Peacekeeper and Delta from this same location on Maplewood over the years.  What can I say I worked in the rocket industry so it was a pleasure to watch night launches especially if they occurred shortly after sunset as you would get good reflection of the vehicle and exhaust.There is no way this was a military launch.",Duration:3-4 minutes,"Location: Poway, CA",Occurred : 11/7/2015 18:10  (Entered as : 11/07/15 18:10),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/7/2015 8:39:32 PM 20:39,Shape: Sphere

The searchlight-like beams below the light stretched down and grew brighter. Two distinct beams were being projected at about a 30 degree angle below and to the left of the light. The light appeared to be at a high altitude, and I thought at first it was a satellite reentering Earth’s atmosphere. It was moving at a rate of speed similar to an aircraft, and as it moved Northwest, the beams grew in intensity. The cloud beneath it remained luminescent for some time as the light progress! ed, and it left a separate, fainter blue-colored trail, behind it marking it’s direction of travel. As I watched the light went behind some tall trees, and I lost sight of it. It reappeared much dimmer when it emerged from the trees, with no lights projecting from beneath it. It slowed, and became an amorphous light (more like Haley’s comet the last time it came around) and seemed to change shape, from a point of light to a vertical shape.

McDowell Blvd, entering the Baywood Dr Rotary.On my right, roughly 500 feet in the air, I saw a large matte silver cone, about 60 feet in height.The tip was pointed upward at a 25 degree angle and the craft was rising at about 40mph.From the bottom of the cone, a bright xenon-ish white light, roughly 10,000,000 candle watt, expended in a sharply defined line, that broadened into a conical shape, 300 feet behind it.The craft entered low hung clouds, which illuminated the clouds but the sharply illuminated line remained, suspended in the air, much like an airline chemtrail.The illuminated line, remained for over 3 minutes, slowly dimming, until it was barely visible.I counted at least 7 vehicles passing by me on Baywood Dr but none had stopped to watch. One briefly entered the on-coming traffic lane, which I assume, was from watching the event.I took out my cell phone to shoot a video but I did not record anything viable.I am familiar with all types of aircraft, military & civilian, this was neither.Usually when an illumination source is extinguished, so is the light it projects.

The light was a bright white flame and there was smoke swirling around this flaming cone  of light.  No sound, spooky.

The shape was visible for seconds while we were at an angle to see what looked like the flaming bottom of a large cone shape. As it continue noiselessly across the night sky the flame disappeared from view and except for a few wisps of smoke the sky seemed to revert to its normal inky beauty.  The streetlights made it hard to follow but we did pick up a faint outline of a cone moving up and away from us at what seemed to be a 90• angle to the ho! rizon.

We were all looking toward the southeast watching the object together for several minutes. My son originally spotted the object. My wife got a couple of good photos.The object appeared to e emit a cone-shaped plume of white illuminated material. There also appeared to be a lingering green beam of light behind the object. The green beam appeared to be about as wide as the full moon and very straight and consistent in its pale green color. The green beam persisted for several minutes and appeared to stretch toward the horizon behind the object.The white plume appeared to be illuminated and appeared to grow as the object proceeded toward the west/northwest in a straight line.After watching the objects and plume for more about a minute the plume suddenly cut off and the object continued to move ahead in a straight line. The plume expanded behind the object and appeared to be approximately 5+ degrees in width.One other witness and I continued to watch the object move toward the western horizon. After approximately 4 minutes the object appeared to brighten and become stationary.

3869,"White light with diffuse blue trail seen from Los AngelesAt approximately 6:00 pm I was feeding my dogs in my northeast Los Angeles backyard.   The sky was already dark as sunset in Los Angeles was at 4:55pm.  I happened to look to the west when I saw a bright white light.The object was approximately 50 degrees above the southwest horizon.   Emanating from the point of white light was an area of illumination resembling a cone, with the tip of the cone at the light and the bottom part of the cone shining to the east toward me.  The cone of diffuse light was approximately 10 degrees in length.  This cone shaped area of illumination seemed to consist of light reflecting off air particles, similar to the way a flashlight shows a shaft of light when shined into a dusty sky.   There was no noise associated with the light. The object and its cone-shaped shaft of light remained stationary for a minute or two.  Then the object moved to the north very slowly until it was due west of me.  Behind the white light (extending south of the light) appeared an area of blue glow approximately 10 degrees in diameter.  The area of blue glow was diffuse and somewhat oval shaped, like a diffuse cloud.  The blue glow was pronounced at first, but slowly began to grow dim.  At this point the white cone-shaped shaft of light that had been emanating from the white point of light had disappeared.  The white point of light grew dim but still traveled northward very slowly.   The diffuse, dim blue “cloud” remained for approximately 10 minutes and then gradually faded.   The white point of light also faded away as it traveled slowly in a northward direction. This may have been a rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force base north of Los Angeles.  However, I am not sure and so decided to issue this report.  I have witnessed a few Vandenberg rocket launches from Los Angeles in the past.

I saw three white lights in the night sky configured in a triangle.  They looked like an airplane.  There were other lights from airplanes in the sky, except there was a powerful cone of light shooting down toward the ground from these three lights. I thought maybe I was watching a police or military helicopter searching for something on the ground. Inside the cone of light were blue and green beams that looked like maybe they were from a powerful spotlight.  The beams were tracking the three lights and I couldn't tell if the beams were from spotlights on the ground or being beamed down from the lights. I could see lights from what looked like an airliner in front of the three lights and I thought maybe the airliner was towing some kind of device with a powerful spotlight on it. Except the three lights kept going higher and higher in the sky as the airliner flew! west toward the Bay Area. I pulled over in the dirt on W. Schulte Road before the depot. The sky was glowing green where I had first seen the three lights over the depot, except the three lights were high in the distance now headed up and to the west. They now looked like a single star like the other stars in the sky, except a faint cone of light was shooting down from it almost looking like a comet. My phone couldn't get a picture and the lights were fading higher and higher. The green glow in the clouds was still there to the south over Tracy. I tried to keep my eyes on the lights as I entered town but they disappeared in the sky behind the city lights.

I figured it was a helicopter and asked my wife to look at it. her response was surprising. She had a better view of the object and became very startled at what she was seeing. the object began to take a crescent pattern and then went dark. The three of us where puzzled at what we just observed and was discussing what we had just seen. the object then re-appeared in a different location bigger and brighter than before it then flew in the sky and justed stopped. at that point it shined a light from it much like a police helicopter but the light did not reach the ground. the light shined and stopped about 20 meters behind it. at that point a ""cloud"" formed around it that had a green color to it. the object stopped moving and the light dimmed and the cloud disappeared but didn't disapate.

The part of the scene we saw slowly dissipated until we couldn't make it out anymore, and the circle of haze around it disappeared. Our friend called her grandmother who lives on the outskirts of Ramona to see if she witnessed the event, and her grandmother said yes she had been watching it for a while.

I arrived home and stopped at the bottom of my driveway to manually put my truck in 4 wheel drive so I can drive up to the house without spinning my tires on the dirt driveway. Just as I locked the hubs on my front wheels I noticed a very bright light above the home across the road from me. It looked like a huge comet with a large blueish tail and a huge funnel shape fan head with a bright light at the apex.  It was traveling from the southeast toward the west.  The widest side of the funnel took up about 20 degrees of sky which was as wide as my hand held at arm’s length with fingers up.  It was traveling parallel to the horizon. By the time I reached the top of the driveway and called my wife to come and look, the lights had faded and the bright point of light in front had vanished, however the tail was still glowing blueish white but seemed out of focus and was fading away.

While the light was on the right of the cloud a thick somewhat translucent green beam was stationary coming out of the left side. The light continued to move upward and to the right and eventually got far enough away that it was no longer connected to the light cloud. When this happened the green beam also dissipated. The light cloud however remained in the sky for the next 10 minutes. The original light moved far away but remained visible, it appeared to move further up in the sky and then there seamed to be another shower like light beam extendi! ng downward.

Then quite quickly the light flashed brighter like an explosion, and then I could see a trail of debris or sparks spread out behind the light.  If the light was half an inch wide in the sky the debris field was 4 inches about.  I was pointing to other drivers saying ""are you seeing this?"", and then the light changed colors to white/blue-ish and started to travel towards me.

3904,"White light in the W/SW sky traveling north that shortly after created a bright white fan behind it that then turned blue/green.((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD))November 7, 2015 At approximately 6:00 pm as I was getting out of my car I noticed a very bright light in the W/SW sky at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.   As the light moved across the sky left to right, all of a sudden, and very quickly, a large white bright tail in the shape of a fan formed.  The fan shape was in a horizontal position and not vertical as one might see from a rocket.  The fan dissipated rather quickly as the object continued across the sky in a northerly direction. As the fan dissipated, there was a distinct blue/green color that remained in the sky for quite a while as the object continued in the apparent northerly direction.  Then as the object was almost directly west from my location it appeared to lose intensity as if it was going away from me.  I rushed into the house and grabbed my binoculars to see if I could get a better view as it was growing dimmer.  As I focused on the object, it appeared to be a circular shape with no real defining marks, and steel g! ray in color.  The color may have been affected by the haze around the object and that it was starting to get dimmer.  However, it did appear to be alternating in brightness intensity that was discernable through the binoculars.  The light continued to dim, again as if it was moving away from my location, and within 20/30 seconds the circular shape was no longer visible.  The barely visible light then had “light tails” above and below the object, not behind, until it was no longer visible.  The entire “show” lasted until about 6:20, and there was only one object as far as I could determine.   However, the blue/green color in the sky noted above lasted for another 10 minutes or so, and didn’t seem to move from the location where I first noticed it.  Our house is in the flight path of planes landing at the Orange County Airport, and there were also several helicopters in the sky at the time.  I’m sure some of them had to see this as well.

My husband saw it as glowing red and I saw it as white.There was a beam of light between them that looked like either the upper dot was sending the beam to the lower one, or visa versa.We began to comment on what we had seen and then noticed that the beam was gone (we did not see it disappear) and that the lower, smaller dot was moving away, slowly, to the east.After a couple of seconds I leaned forward to look through the windshield on my side, the passenger side, and saw that there was a spiral in the sky. (I didn't see it form).My husband looked through the windshield on my side of the car and saw it too, and pulled over beside the freeway; got out of the car and stood at the rear of the car, on the passengers side; I stayed inside and looked through the window.The sky was dark and the spiral looked like clouds or fog that were in a round pattern with a small dark hole in the center, similar to what a satellite photo of a hurricane looks like on the TV weather news. It quickly elongated, moving to the west, towards the ocean.As it expanded I saw a blue stream of light in the center of the “cloud”.  The cloud became cone shaped in the front and continued moving away from us, westward.After several seconds the formation seemed to end and the cloud dissipated, although the blue streak stayed suspended in the air for several minutes.We continued to look to the west, in the direction that the cone-cloud had been traveling and I could see a faint plume that appeared to be going straight up, far in the distance.((NUFORC Note:  U.

3924,"Bluish tail mist((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD))Bright light was traveling from the southeast to northwest with a bluish mist or tail behind it that was really long.  Then the object started a fan shaped contrail with the same bluish mist that spread out over a huge area that tapered off to a point behind the object.  The bluish mist stopped suddenly but you could still see the straight tail and the fanning out of the mist.  The object kept going in a straight line and it seemed to be really high in the sky, at the very least in the 10's of miles up.  After watching it for a few min it seemed to shroud itself in a mist again but not as much as before.  It traveled that way for about 2 more min then it looked like it shot another tail of mist in front of it, kind of looked like a comet at that point, but it was in front of the object.  Meaning it was traveling towards the tail it was shooting out.  After another min it shot a tail out behind it while at the same time still had the tail in front of it.  You! could clearly see the object in the middle of the 2 tails.  After a few more min both tails vanished and the object was shrouded in a hazy mist at this time and continued on until it faded from sight.I'm sure there will be reports on this but I haven't seen any yet.

3927,"Incredible blue cylinder of light from craft((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD))Driving on I-5 South, south west of Chico CA two of us observed what at first looked like a helicopter facing east shining a spot beam across the sky (not pointing down). There was a very distinct blue cylinder of light emanating from a bright white light which had crisp lines as if it was perfectly uniform in width, it extended a few degrees of azimuth across the sky. Additionally there was a smaller but much wider cone of whitish light emanating in the same direction. However this object was way too high to be a helicopter. The helicopter comparison would seem logical if the object was 100 or 1000 times closer. We stared at this object for what felt like a few minutes discussing what it could be. During this time it became obvious that is not a helicopter and not static as it seemed. Then we noticed the object was moving west and the white light in the shape of a cone moved with it, the blue light column was still there pointing east (not at the ground). At this point it looked like the bright spot of light was the rear of the object and the cone seemed to be the effect as the object moved, kind of like a wake. This conical wake was impossibly big though. As we drove the object moved an extremely long distance West or WSW. The crisp cylinder of blue light appeared to smear and slowly fade over a few more minutes. During this time we could see the cone of light remain while the bright light of the object continued west. As it moved, narrower cones were created. While we were still looking at the blue light cylinder (now smeared, no more distinct lines) we commented how it was blue. I traced the object west and we saw two pickup trucks pulled over on the side of the road liking in the same direction as the event with their phones out. Eventually you could trace the object until it was extremely far away. At this point a fainter cone of light was behind it and looked to pointing up. To better clarify, the blue cylinder looked like a very bright light until it dissipated 5 minutes after it showed up, the conical ""light"" seemed to not really be light. A good analogy would be that space craft reentry vehicle having a large cone of disturbance behind it, however it would have been impossibly large as the object was so far away.

It was not a helicopter as far as I could tell.  I then looked around the sky and realized there were no other clouds or any fog.!

He told me that there was a bright greenish/blue spot in the sky and it was unlike any atmospheric anomaly he had ever witnessed in San Diego.	I walked out front of my house and looked around, and spotted it immediately as it was VERY vivid. The sky was pretty clear that night so it looked like an oval indigo cloud just hanging in the middle of the atmosphere west of my position, presumably over Sorrento valley or maybe La Jolla. I confirmed on the phone that I saw it too and walked into the street a bit to get a better view.	I spotted a formation below and to the right of the cloud, not moving in the sky. It was far away and hard to see unless I looked at in my peripherals, but I could define at least one white/red pinpoint light and what appeared to be another but was too dim and too far to visibly distinguish. There could have been a cluster of them but I couldn't get my telescope out in time to see. In between the formation was a faint stream of light running vertically, looking like a stream of glowing fog. The formation would become brighter and dimmer periodically, staying in the same spot.	Over time the blue light cloud got harder and harder to see, and the formation below began to tilt clockwise, about 30-45 degrees before I lost track of it. I observed the two from the roof of my house until they slowly faded away and eventually disappeared.

I initially thought it was a rocket, but it looked nothing like the rockets I have seen launched from Cape Canaveral ( I live across the river from the JFK space center in Florida and have seen many launches). The flame/after burn died out and left only a white dot of light. This light slowed and there was a large conical white light that emitted from where the initial white dot was.

You could not see any structure content and you could not see through it.Genesis, Evolution, and Aliens  The Baha'i Faith, claiming to be God's most recent message to humanity, is not just another in a series.  It represents the culmination of a six-thousand year cycle of Prophets, and the transition into a new universal cycle.  While the religion is now in its infancy, taking a broad view of where it falls in history provides a humbling experience to any believer, while an even broader view of the universe stirs up an unparalleled sense of awe. As traditional religion devolves into an irrational superstition, and a strictly materialistic ideology begins to dominate society, the Baha'i Faith teaches the harmony of science and religion. True religion and science must agree, because the truth is one. Genesis ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."" (Gen 1:1) A key to understanding the books of Moses is what Baha'is call progresive revelation: that religious truth is relative to the time of revelation. The people of the time of Moses were obsessed with spiritism and idol worship, with the spiritual and intellectual capacity of today's children. `Abdu'l-Baha said, ""Moses established laws and ordinances; these gave life to the people of Israel, and led them to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period."" (Some Answered Questions, p. 14) In this context the stories of Genesis - and other creation myths - are interpreted as spiritual allegories, in a way that outwardly satisfied people's curiosity of history, while inwardly describing spiritual truths that uplifted society. The common understanding at the time was of the world as an island continent on a flat disc with infinite water, surrounded by a dome with stars embedded in its surface. A modern understanding of how the world developed was not only impossible but unnecessary at the time. The account of Genesis had the advantage of conveying the essential spiritual truths about humanity's development with broad symbolism, and avoided the detail that was beyond the capacity to understand. `Abdu'l-Baha said, ""Moses taught that the world was brought into existence in the six days of creation. This is an allegory, a symbolic form of the ancient truth that the world evolved gradually... We thus have a progressive process of creation, and not a one-time happening. Moses' days of creation represent time spans of millions of years."" (Science and Religion, p. 90) As humanity has progressed with a new capacity to understand its environment, the Baha'i teachings reveal new truths about the world. Baha'u'llah teaches that the physical universe is without beginning or end, and confirms the scientists who claim that the earth developed over millions and billions of years. Yet similar to Moses, Baha'u'llah's teachings focus on the spiritual development of society and the control of one's lower nature. On the nature of creation and existence, `Abdu'l-Baha says, ""If we could imagine a time when no beings existed, this imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God. Moreover, absolute non-existence cannot become existence. If the beings were absolutely non-existent, existence would not have come into being."" Accordingly, the story of Adam and Eve contains ""divine mysteries and universal meanings, and it is capable of marvelous explanations,"" but is simply a symbol, and cannot be reasonably imagined as a historical account. Evolution  On the origin of humans, Baha'u'llah similarly confirms biological development of humans over millions of years in different forms. He also taught that the human species was always distinct from the animal kingdom in potentiality. Some of the most striking and direct comments on evolution come from `Abdu'l-Baha, where he says that man's existence on the earth has developed over a long time. He says, ""Between man and the ape, however, there is one link missing, and to the present time scientists have not been able to discover it...""The philosophers of the Orient in reply to those of the western world say: Let us suppose that the human anatomy was primordially different from its present form, that it was gradually transformed from one stage to another until it attained its present likeness, that at one time it was similar to a fish, later an invertebrate and finally human. This anatomical evolution or progression does not alter or affect the statement that the development of man was always human in type and biological in progression. For the human embryo when examined microscopically is at first a mere germ or worm. Gradually as it develops it shows certain divisions; rudiments of hands and feet appear--that is to say, an upper and a lower part are distinguishable. Afterward it undergoes certain distinct changes until it reaches its actual human form and is born into this world. But at all times, even when the embryo resembled a worm, it was human in potentiality and character, not animal. The for! ms assumed by the human embryo in its successive changes do not prove that it is animal in its essential character. Throughout this progression there has been a transference of type, a conservation of species or kind. Realizing this we may acknowledge the fact that at one time man was an inmate of the sea, at another period an invertebrate, then a vertebrate and finally a human being standing erect... Therefore, in the protoplasm, man is man. Conservation of species demands it.""The lost link of Darwinian theory is itself a proof that man is not an animal. How is it possible to have all the links present and that important link absent? Its absence is an indication that man has never been an animal. It will never be found."" (Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 358-359) This statement was delivered in a speech in 1912. These ideas brought harmony to the diverging forces of science and religion at the time. Soul  The rational soul, according to Baha'u'llah, gives humans an intelligence that makes discoveries and penetrates the reality of things. Animals and humans share the same physical powers, but an animal cannot evolve the intellectual powers of humans, who have the freewill to overcome the animalistic nature of the body. One evidence of this power is contemplation and reflection, as described by `Abdu'l-Baha, ""It is clear that when man is thinking, it is as though he were consulting with some other person. With whom is he consulting? It is evident that it is another reality or one aside from this body with whom he enters into consultation when he thinks, 'Shall I do this work or not?' 'What will be the result of my doing this?' ... And then that reality in man communicates its opinion to him concerning the point at issue. Therefore that reality in man is clearly and obviously other than his body, an ego with which man enters into consultation and whose opinion man seeks."" (Foundations of World Unity, p. 109) Origins of Life  Humans developed on earth over millions of years, alongside plants and animals. A question then arises: how did it all get here? After all, the story of Genesis came to satisfy the most fundamental controversy. Even with a childish understanding of the world around them, the nomadic followers of Moses could see that they came from their parents, who came from their grandparents, etc. The story of Adam explained the first seed of life, by a literal account six thousand years ago. This question is where the worlds of science and religion collide. Most scientific theories about the origins of life propose a spontaneous creation of simple molecules in high levels of energy. Another theory proposes that the seeds of life came to earth on meteorites. In other words, the potential for life is either inherent in the planet, or the seeds of life are so prevalent that they permeate the universe, the latter theory appropriately called panspermia. Either way, the implications are incredibly profound. This situation still lacks an impulse to the universe, which, according to Baha'u'llah, is a mystery that can never be fully comprehended. `Abdu'l-Baha elaborates on the idea of creation, ""No Divinity can be conceived as separate from creation, for otherwise it would be like imagining an empire without a people... So, likewise, if we say there was a time when God had no creation or created beings, a time when there were no recipients of His bounties and that His names and attributes had not been manifested, this would be equivalent to a complete denial of Divinity, for it would mean that Divinity is accidental. To explain it still more clearly, if we think that fifty thousand years ago or one hundred thousand years ago there was no creation, that there were then no worlds, no human beings, no animals, this thought of ours would mean that previous to that period there was no Divinity... It is, therefore, evident that inasmuch as the reality of Divinity is without a beginning, creation is also without a beginning. This is as clear as the sun. When we contemplate this vast machinery of omnipresent power, perceive this illimitable space and its innumerable w! orlds, it will become evident to us that the lifetime of this infinite creation is more than six thousand years."" (Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 470) As well as a timeless creation, the universe is also described as having no end. Aliens  The issue of extraterrestrial life is inextricably bound up with the subject of creation and evolution. Baha'u'llah made a dramatic statement about life in the universe, ""The learned men, that have fixed at several thousand years the life of this earth, have failed, throughout the long period of their observation, to consider either the number or the age of the other planets. Consider, moreover, the manifold divergencies that have resulted from the theories propounded by these men. Know thou that every fixed star hath its own planets, and every planet its own creatures, whose number no man can compute."" (Gleanings, p. 163) It was over a century after Baha'u'llah's writing this that science confirmed the nebular hypothesis, which states that the formation of planets is a natural part of star formation. As previously described, if life on earth developed inherently or externally, it is a logical conclusion that the same potential for life exists everywhere in the universe. Clearly, though, life as we understand it could not survive to the same extent on Jupiter, with clouds of ammonia. `Abdu'l-Baha taught that life develops on other planets according to the environment, ""The earth has its inhabitants, the water and the air contain many living beings and all the elements have their nature spirits, then how is it possible to conceive that these stupendous stellar bodies are not inhabited? Verily, they are peopled, but let it be known that the dwllers accord with the elements of their respective spheres. These living beings do not have states of consciousness like unto those who live on the surface of this globe: the power of adaptation and environment moulds their bodies and states of consciousness, just as our bodies and minds are suited to our planet. For example, we have birds that live in the air, those that live on the earth and those that live in the sea... The components of the sun differ from those of this earth, for there are certain light and life-giving elements radiating from the sun. Exactly the same elements may exist in two bodies, but in varying quantities. For instance, there is fire and air in water, but the allotted me! asure is small in proportion. They have discovered that there is a great quantity of radium in the sun; the same element is found on the earth, but in a much smaller degree. Beings who inhabit those distant luminous bodies are attuned to the elements that have gone into their composition of their respective spheres."" (Divine Philosophy, pp. 114-115) The nature of extraterrestrial life remains elusive, but it's clear that there are creatures in the universe that have similar intellectual powers and spiritual perception that humans have on earth. Given the infinite time span of the universe, it's obvious that other planets have gone through a similar process of evolution with Manifestations of God guiding them through various stages of unity until a universal cycle culminates in a planet-wide unity, which is the transition to a new era, a new universal spiritual cycle of the planet. Other planets have progressed past that cycle into further cycles that are beyond the dimmest comprehension of humans at this time. The Adamic cycle began about six thousand years ago, and its supreme Manifestation is Baha'u'llah. The Baha'i cycle will span half a million years, and Manifestations of God will appear about every thousand years during that time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3975,"Passenger on Southwest flight from NH to MD observed dozens of red pulsating spherical objects traveling in the opposite direction at lPassenger on Southwest flight observed dozens of UFOs traveling in a northeasterly path on Nov. 6th, 2015, between Baltimore, Maryland and Manchester, New Hampshire. On November 6th, 2015, from 5:00 to 6:10 PM, I was on a Southwest flight from Manchester Airport in NH to Baltimore Washington International Airport.  The plane’s cruising altitude was 34,000 feet.  The sky was clear and stars were visible but far below there was a blanket of clouds with some breaks through which I could see cities.  I saw dozens of red pulsating objects far below the plane, perhaps three miles below.  At any one time I could see five to ten ufos over a wide area.  They seemed to be at about the same altitude and were almost all traveling in a line in a north/northeasterly direction above the low cloud cover.  This continued for about forty minutes of the flight.  The objects were red and pulsating but some flashed a bright white before going back to pulsating red.  Some blinked off at times but came back on. Some of the objects seemed to stay in place while others traveled by.  A couple of times it seemed as it there was going to be a joining or collision of two or three of the objects.  My cell phone was in the bin overhead because I had taken a front row seat and didn’t think to keep it out so instead I focused on watching the objects.  I am guessing that these objects were at least a mile or maybe two miles to the east of the plane and maybe three miles below.  It is hard for me to estimate this.  From my perspective they appeared to be about the same size, about an eighth of an inch in diameter as I held my fingers up to the window.  They were all spherical shaped. As the plane was descending I saw one very bright white light in the distance.  This was not like the other objects.  At first it was about a half dollar size as I held my fingers up to my window but it was distant at that point. It was not pulsating at all, it was just a steady bright white light.  It was not far below the plane like the other objects but was flying straight towards us at about the same altitude as our plane.  I could not make out any shape because of the brightness of the light.  As the light continued to get closer to the plane, I asked the woman sitting next to me to look out the window.  She saw it, too.  I made a comment that no plane should be traveling directly toward us.  There were no blinking lights that planes have on their wings; it was just a very bright light.  I think it was about two minutes that I watched this light.  Then the plane swerved to the right suddenly, about a 45 degree turn toward the west. The plane banked slightly to make this turn and I lost sight of the object for a short time.  Then the plane leveled off and I saw it off and moving behind the left wing. I think it was closer than half a football field.  It continued past the wing and I lost sight of it for good when it disappeared from my view behind the tail section.  The plane continued descending through the dense cloud layer and touched down within five to ten minutes of that last sighting.  When we broke through the clouds/fog, we were so close to the runway, maybe a hundred feet off the ground.  The fog was so low and dense that nothing was visible in the sky from the ground.  I’m still trying to make sense of what I saw.  I wanted to ask the pilot, copilot, and FAA inspector, all of who had to see what I was seeing but I didn’t.  It would have meant holding up everyone on the plane and I didn’t think I would be given any information anyway.  I am hoping that one of the three pilots on board will look for this or another report for that Southwest flight on November 6th, 2015, and maybe file their own reports.",Duration:40 minutes,"Location: Manchester to Baltimore, MD, NH",Occurred : 11/6/2015 17:15  (Entered as : 11/06/15 17:15),Posted: 11/19/2015,Reported: 11/12/2015 8:51:10 PM 20:51,Shape: Sphere

As I walked out from my porch, I looked up at the sky as there was a clear spot with huge stars.  I looked over to the East to look at the Moon, when one of the stars in that cluster to the west caught my eye, it started moving, silently.  I quickly looked back and was astounded to see that one of the huge stars on the perimeter of the little formation started moving north slowly, and deliberately, across the sky.  It was not twinkling or changing colors, just a huge ball of light that looked exactly like a star.I stood there in wonder and continued to watch it.  After a few minutes it got closer to what looked like a tiny star and they twinkled at each other as the big one passed the little one. This was just astounding!

3984,"Early evening arrow-like streak throwing off sparksWalking westward down a quiet residential street just after dark, I watched several low and high flying planes coming and going from both Miami International and Opa Locka Executive airports.  Looking just over my left shoulder as I scanned the mostly clear sky, I suddenly witnessed a very unusual object streak by just over the treetops (an altitude of only about 50 - 60 ft.)  It was traveling in straight level line at about the speed of a fast moving bird (40 mph?) while throwing off a trail of sparks.  It was in my view for only about 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared over the houses and trees.  The object itself was not visible, only electric sparks emanating from a thin line probably about a foot or so long. There was no smoke, odor or sound.It looked very much like a 4th of July sparkler shooting through the air like a missile or an arrow, very similar in size, shape and intensity.  Another comparison would be to the tracers they shoot off with fireworks.  The difference was in the trajectory.  This thing moved like it was under its own power and headed somewhere with a purpose.  It wasn’t ascending, descending, or decelerating as one would expect if it was a bottle rocket or some other kind of model rocket or firework and it didn’t explode with a bang.  Also, if it was something like that, I can’t understand how someone could be in a position to direct it along such a horizontal line of flight.Another explanation would be some highly unusual atmospheric effect, but even with sparks flying, it wasn’t high voltage lighting.  It was a calm breezy evening with clear skies except for a few puffy clouds here and there, no charged feeling like we get when thunderstorms roll through.  There were no power lines or street light wires anywhere nearby.   As I continued home, I had that feeling of static electricity running up my back and the hairs of my neck standing on end.
