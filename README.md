## Webscraping National UFO Reporting Center

### Summary

This code webscrapes data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) before cleaning it and running some basic analysis on it

As of 28/09/17 the webscraping code and the output CSVs are available.

The CSVs have not been joined as the combined file was too large for Github (Note: I will add to Github Large File Storage soon)

This project is plan to be completed by mid-November 2017.
