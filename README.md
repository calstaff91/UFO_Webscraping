## Webscraping National UFO Reporting Center

### Summary

This code webscrapes data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) before cleaning it and running some basic analysis on it


As of 10/10/17 the following products are available:

* Webscraping code
* Output CSVs
* Code for visualising data on chloropleth map of US states - dummy data currently used for this

The CSVs have not been joined as the combined file was too large for Github (Note: I will add to Github Large File Storage soon)

This project is plan to be completed by mid-November 2017.
